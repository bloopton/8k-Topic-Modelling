Item 4. Change in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
     On January 14, 2004, Apollo Group, Inc. ("Apollo" or the "Company") dismissed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PricewaterhouseCoopers") as its independent auditor. PricewaterhouseCoopers will complete audit services related to the stand-alone audits of The University of Phoenix, Inc., Western International University, The University of Phoenix, Inc. Puerto Rico Campus, and The College for Financial Planning, Inc. for the year ended August 31, 2003, as well as Compliance Attestation Examinations of Title IV Student Financial Assistance Programs for The University of Phoenix, Inc., Institute for Professional Development, Inc., and Western International University for the year ended August 31, 2003. The Company anticipates that these audit services will be completed by February 27, 2004, at which time PricewaterhouseCoopers will no longer be engaged to perform any audit services for Apollo. Apollo's Audit Committee of the Board of Directors approved these actions.
     The audit reports of PricewaterhouseCoopers on the consolidated financial statements of Apollo for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2003 and August 31, 2002 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.
     During the two most recent fiscal years ended August 31, 2003 and August 31, 2002, and through January 14, 2004, there were no disagreements between the Company and PricewaterhouseCoopers, as defined in Item 304 of Regulation S-K, on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreement, if not resolved to PricewaterhouseCoopers' satisfaction, would have caused PricewaterhouseCoopers to make reference to the subject matter of such disagreement in connection with its reports, and for the same period there were no reportable events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
     On January 14, 2004, Apollo's Audit Committee of the Board of Directors appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte") as its new independent auditor to audit the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2004.
     During Apollo's two most recent fiscal years ended August 31, 2003 and August 31, 2002, and the subsequent interim periods through the date of this report, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf consulted with Deloitte regarding any of the matters or events set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.
     The Company has provided PricewaterhouseCoopers with a copy of the foregoing statements. Attached as Exhibit 16 is a copy of PricewaterhouseCoopers' letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission dated January 21, 2004, stating its agreement with such statements.

     Phoenix, Arizona, August 12, 2004  Apollo Group, Inc. today announced that it will convert all outstanding shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock (Nasdaq:UOPX) into shares of Apollo Education Group Class A common stock (Nasdaq:APOL) effective August 27, 2004.
     Todd S. Nelson, CEO and Chairman, said, "We believe that the conversion of University of Phoenix Online common stock will allow us to focus on online learning across all of our platforms and removes any market uncertainty arising from the potential conversion of these shares."
Conversion of University of Phoenix Online Shares
     In accordance with the terms of Apollo Group, Inc.'s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, each outstanding share of University of Phoenix Online common stock will be converted into 1.11527 shares of Apollo Education Group Class A common stock as of August 27, 2004. The conversion ratio is based upon the relative market values of Apollo Education Group Class A common stock and University of Phoenix Online common stock averaged over the 20 trading days (July 9, 2004 through August 5, 2004) ending 5 trading days prior to today's announcement, and includes a 10 percent premium on the value of University of Phoenix Online common stock, all as required by the terms of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation. The conversion is expected to result in the issuance of approximately 16.7 million new shares of Apollo Education Group Class A common stock. There are no regulatory approvals or other conditions that must be satisfied prior to the conversion becoming effective. As provided in Apollo Group, Inc.'s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, there is no shareholder vote on the conversion.
     No fractional share interests will be issued. Shareholders who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share will instead be paid cash for such fractional interest in an amount based upon the market value of a share of Apollo Education Group Class A common stock as of the fifth trading day prior to the August 27, 2004 conversion date.
     Current holders of record of University of Phoenix Online common stock will receive a notice explaining the conversion. A copy of the notice is also available at www.apollogrp.edu.
     Following the Conversion Date, Apollo Group, Inc. will have two classes of common stock, Apollo Education Group Class A common stock which will continue to trade on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol APOL and Apollo Education Group Class B common stock.
 
Updated Business Outlook
     The conversion of the University of Phoenix Online common stock will require us to record certain non-cash charges related to the premium paid to convert outstanding shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock to Apollo Education Group Class A common stock and related to the conversion of University of Phoenix Online stock options into Apollo Education Group Class A stock options.
     As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 "Earnings per Share," Apollo Group, Inc. expects to reduce net income attributable to Apollo Education Group common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 related to the non-cash 10% premium paid to redeem the University of Phoenix Online common stock. The amount of the reduction to net income attributable to Apollo Education Group common stock will be calculated based on the number of University of Phoenix Online common stock outstanding and converted on August 27, 2004. Based on the number of University of Phoenix Online common stock outstanding on August 12, 2004, we would expect to reduce net income attributable to Apollo Education Group common stock by $115 million related to the non-cash premium.
     As required by Emerging Issues Task Force No. 00-23 "Issues Related to the Accounting for Stock Compensation under APB Opinion No. 25 and FASB Interpretation No. 44," Apollo Group, Inc. expects to recognize approximately $149 million of non-cash pre-tax expense related to the conversion of University of Phoenix Online stock options into Apollo Education Group Class A stock options. We expect between $113 million and $126 million of the option conversion expense will be recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. The amount recognized as option conversion expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 will be based on the total number of options vested at August 31, 2004. The remaining expense is expected to be recognized in fiscal years 2005 and 2006.
     Excluding the non-cash charges detailed above, we reiterate our guidance dated June 24, 2004.
     The company will hold a conference call to discuss the conversion of University of Phoenix Online common stock at 11:00 AM Eastern time, 8:00 AM Phoenix time, on August 13, 2004.

Exhibit 99.1
     Phoenix, Arizona, October 5, 2004  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOL) today reported fiscal 2004 financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended August 31, 2004.
     Todd S. Nelson, CEO and Chairman, said, "I am pleased to announce another strong quarter of earnings and enrollment growth with diluted earnings per share of $.52 (excluding non-cash expenses associated with the conversion of the UOPX tracking stock and the United States Department of Education settlement) and degree enrollment growth of 28% (including 14% growth at University of Phoenix local campuses and 50% growth at the University of Phoenix Online campus)." Mr. Nelson further commented, "During the fourth quarter we opened four new University of Phoenix campuses, which brings the total number of new campuses opened in fiscal 2004 to nine. Additionally, the Board of Directors recently authorized an additional $500 million in Company funds to repurchase shares of APOL stock."
     During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we converted all outstanding shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock into shares of Apollo Education Group Class A common stock. The conversion resulted in a $114.2 million reduction to net income related to the premium paid to convert outstanding shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock to Apollo Education Group Class A common stock and a non-cash stock-based compensation charge of $123.5 million related to the conversion of University of Phoenix Online stock options into Apollo Education Group Class A stock options. In addition, we accrued $9.8 million related to the resolution of a United States Department of Education (ED) program review. Excluding these charges, net income attributed to Apollo Education Group common stock for the three months and year ended August 31, 2004, was $93.1 million, or $.52 per diluted share, and $335.6 million, or $1.88 per diluted share, respectively.
     Net income (loss) attributed to Apollo Education Group common stock (including the conversion of the UOPX tracking stock and the ED settlement referenced above) for the three months and year ended August 31, 2004 was ($104.7 million), or ($.59) per diluted share and $137.8 million, or $.77 per diluted share, respectively, compared to $65.5 million, or $.37 per diluted share and $231.7 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, respectively, reported for the same periods last year.
     Total consolidated revenues for Apollo Group, Inc. for the three months ended August 31, 2004 rose 32.7% to $492.8 million, compared with $371.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The University of Phoenix accounted for 95.7% of the $457.9 million in net tuition revenues from students enrolled in degree programs for the quarter ended August 31, 2004.
     Total consolidated revenues for Apollo Group, Inc. for the year ended August 31, 2004 rose 34.3% to $1.80 billion, compared with $1.34 billion in the same period last year.

     This press release includes statements that constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the "Reform Act"). Apollo Group, Inc. claims the protection of the safe-harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Reform Act. These forward-looking statements are often characterized by the terms "may," "believes," "projects," "expects," or "anticipates," and do not reflect historical facts. Specific forward-looking statements contained in this press release relate, among other matters, to the business outlook of Apollo Group, Inc. and University of Phoenix Online.
     Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results, performance or achievements of Apollo Group, Inc. and University of Phoenix Online to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could affect Apollo Group, Inc.'s or University of Phoenix Online's results and cause them to materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements include:
     These forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs, and assumptions of Apollo Group, Inc. and its management and speak only as of the date made and are not guarantees of future performance. Apollo Group, Inc. undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, or any facts, events or circumstances after the date hereof that may bear upon forward-looking statements.

To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company used non-GAAP measures of pro forma net income and pro forma diluted earnings per share, which are adjusted from our GAAP results as shown above. These non-GAAP adjustments are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our current financial performance. We believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain charges and other amounts that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results. These non-GAAP measures are included to provide investors and management with an alternative method for assessing the Company's operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of the Company's ongoing operations and to provide a more consistent basis for comparison between quarters. These measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for, GAAP and may be different from pro forma measures used by other companies. The difference between the GAAP amounts and the pro forma amounts is the result of the following special items recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004:
 The conversion of University of Phoenix Online common stock on August 27, 2004 required us to adjust GAAP income by the premium paid to convert outstanding shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock to Apollo Education Group Class A common stock and to record a stock-based compensation charge related to the conversion of University of Phoenix Online stock options into Apollo Education Group Class A stock options.
Stock dividends paid and stock-based compensation
 
As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 "Earnings per Share," we reduced net income attributable to Apollo Education Group common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 by approximately $114 million related to the non-cash 10% premium paid to redeem the University of Phoenix Online common stock. The amount of the reduction to net income attributable to Apollo Education Group common stock was calculated based on the number of shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock outstanding and converted on August 27, 2004. This non-cash premium is included on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as stock dividends paid.
As required by Emerging Issues Task Force No. 00-23 "Issues Related to the Accounting for Stock Compensation under APB Opinion No. 25 and FASB Interpretation No. 44," we expect to recognize approximately $147 million of non-cash pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to the conversion of University of Phoenix Online stock options into Apollo Education Group Class A stock options. We recognized approximately $124 million of the pre-tax stock-based compensation expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and will recognize the remaining $23 million as the options vest through 2006.
 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we accrued $9.8 million related to the resolution of a United States Department of Education program review.

EXHIBIT 99.1
     Phoenix, Arizona, March 29, 2005  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOL) today reported fiscal 2005 financial results for the second quarter ended February 28, 2005.
     Net income attributed to Apollo Education Group common stock for the three months ended February 28, 2005, was $87.1 million, or $.47 per diluted share, compared to $63.0 million, or $.35 per diluted share reported for the same period last year.
     Net income attributed to Apollo Education Group common stock for the six months ended February 28, 2005, was $196.6 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, compared to $141.4 million, or $.79 per diluted share reported for the same period last year.
     Todd S. Nelson, Chairman and CEO, said, "We are pleased with our financial performance and overall enrollment growth this quarter. While we continue to invest in lead generation, the rate of increase in selling and promotional expenses declined from 48% in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 to 38% in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. During the quarter, we experienced a positive migration from our onground campuses of students with limited previous college experience to our online program designed for these students. Results to date indicate that retention of students in this academic program, which includes more faculty contact hours, is positive. We plan to implement this program at our onground University of Phoenix campuses during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. We believe that this migration of students to our online program is why our online enrollment is slightly ahead of our expectations and our onground enrollment is slightly below our expectations. The second quarter proved to be a strong quarter for campus openings. The University of Phoenix entered into a new state with a campus in Des Moines, Iowa and opened three new campuses in existing states; Richmond, VA; Raleigh, NC; and Austin, TX."
     Mr. Nelson continued, "The board of directors authorized a program allocating an additional $250 million in company funds to repurchase shares of Apollo Education Group Class A common stock."
     Total consolidated revenues for Apollo Group, Inc. for the three months ended February 28, 2005, rose 27.4% to $505.7 million, compared with $396.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. The University of Phoenix accounted for 90.8% of the $467.6 million in net tuition revenues from students enrolled in degree programs for the quarter ended February 28, 2005.
     Total consolidated revenues for Apollo Group, Inc. for the six months ended February 28, 2005, rose 28.7% to $1.041 billion, compared with $808.7 million in the same period last year. The University of Phoenix accounted for 92.5% of the $961.1 million in net tuition revenues from students enrolled in degree programs for the six months ended February 28, 2005.
     Consolidated net income for Apollo Group, Inc. for the three months ended February 28, 2005, increased 27.2% to $87.1 million, compared to $68.5 million for the same period last year.
 
     Consolidated net income for Apollo Group, Inc. for the six months ended February 28, 2005, increased 28.7% to $196.6 million, compared to $152.8 million for the same period last year.
     Consolidated degree enrollments for all of the Apollo Group, Inc. institutions at February 28, 2005, increased by 25% to 283,800 students compared to 227,800 students at February 29, 2004.

Enrollments at onground campuses at February 28, 2005, increased by 9% to 140,000 students compared to 128,400 students at February 29, 2004.
Business Outlook

Exhibit 99.1
     Phoenix, Arizona, October 12, 2005  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOL) today reported fiscal 2005 financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended August 31, 2005.
     Todd S. Nelson, Chairman and CEO, said, "We are pleased with our financial performance for fiscal 2005.

     Mr. Nelson continued, "The board of directors authorized a program allocating an additional $300 million in company funds to repurchase shares of Apollo Education Group Class A common stock."
     During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we converted all outstanding shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock into shares of Apollo Education Group Class A common stock. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the conversion resulted in a non-cash stock-based compensation charge of $19.8 million related to the conversion of University of Phoenix Online stock options to Apollo Education Group stock options. Excluding this charge, net income attributed to Apollo Education Group common stock for the three months and year ended August 31, 2005, was $118.2 million, or $.65 per diluted share, and $456.7 million, or $2.46 per diluted share, respectively.

In addition, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we accrued $9.8 million related to the resolution of a United States Department of Education (ED) program review. Excluding these charges, net income attributed to Apollo Education Group common stock for the three months and year ended August 31, 2004, was $93.1 million, or $.52 per diluted share, and $335.6 million, or $1.88 per diluted share, respectively.
     Net income (loss) attributed to Apollo Education Group common stock (including the stock-based compensation charge) for the three months ended August 31, 2005, was $106.2 million, or $.58 per diluted share, compared to ($104.7 million), or ($.59) per diluted share (including the stock-based compensation charge and related dividend and the ED settlement) reported for the same period last year.

To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company used non-GAAP measures of pro forma net income and pro forma diluted earnings per share, which are adjusted from our GAAP results as shown above. These non-GAAP adjustments are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our current financial performance. We believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain charges and other amounts that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results. These non-GAAP measures are included to provide investors and management with an alternative method for assessing the Company's operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of the Company's ongoing operations and to provide a more consistent basis for comparison between quarters. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP and may be different from pro forma measures used by other companies. The difference between the GAAP amounts and the pro forma amounts is the result of the following special items recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and 2004:
 The conversion of University of Phoenix Online common stock on August 27, 2004 required us to adjust GAAP income by the premium paid to convert outstanding shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock to Apollo Education Group Class A common stock and to record a stock-based compensation charge related to the conversion of University of Phoenix Online stock options into Apollo Education Group Class A stock options.
Stock dividends paid and stock-based compensation
 
As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 "Earnings per Share," we reduced net income attributable to Apollo Education Group common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 by approximately $114 million related to the non-cash 10% premium paid to redeem the University of Phoenix Online common stock. The amount of the reduction to net income attributable to Apollo Education Group common stock was calculated based on the number of shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock outstanding and converted on August 27, 2004. This non-cash premium is included on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as stock dividends paid.
As required by Emerging Issues Task Force No. 00-23 "Issues Related to the Accounting for Stock Compensation under APB Opinion No. 25 and FASB Interpretation No. 44," we expect to recognize approximately $145 million of non-cash pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to the conversion of University of Phoenix Online stock options into Apollo Education Group Class A stock options. We recognized approximately $124 million of the pre-tax stock-based compensation expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and $20 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, and will recognize the remaining $2 million as the options vest in 2006 and 2007.
 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we accrued $9.8 million related to the resolution of a United States Department of Education program review.

Exhibit 99.1
     Phoenix, Arizona, December 15, 2005  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOL) today reported fiscal 2006 financial results for the first quarter ended November 30, 2005.
     Net income attributed to Apollo Education Group common stock for the three months ended November 30, 2005, was $130.8 million, or $.73 per diluted share, compared to $109.5 million, or $.58 per diluted share reported for the same period last year.
     Total consolidated revenues for Apollo Group, Inc. for the three months ended November 30, 2005, rose 17.6% to $628.9 million, compared with $534.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The University of Phoenix accounted for 84.7% of the $582.1 million in net tuition revenues from students enrolled in degree programs for the quarter ended November 30, 2005. We believe revenue was impacted approximately $5 million as a result of Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Wilma.
     Todd S. Nelson, Chairman and CEO, said, "I am pleased to announce several positive events at Apollo Group that we believe will allow Apollo to become a stronger force in the education industry. Brian Mueller has been promoted to Chief Operating Officer. Brian has been responsible for the growth and expansion of online education for Apollo over the last decade. In this new role he will be responsible for the consolidation of our online and on-ground marketing and enrollment efforts. We believe that over time this will reduce our marketing expenditures on a per student basis, improve conversion rates and retention, and reduce potential confusion in the marketplace."
     Mr. Nelson continued, "We are pleased to announce that the University of Phoenix board of directors and the Western International University board of directors have approved the transfer of Axia College from Western International University to University of Phoenix. As a part of University of Phoenix, we believe Axia College will be strengthened by the brand recognition of University of Phoenix and the stronger regulatory and academic infrastructure of University of Phoenix. It will take several months to accomplish the regulatory and personnel changes necessary to ensure a smooth transition. To accommodate the possible impact of the transition we are reducing revenue guidance for the year by 4%. We believe the impact on diluted earnings per share will range from no impact to a reduction of 2% (new guidance for the year will now be a range of $2.91 -$2.85) for the year. This adjustment will allow us the flexibility to accomplish the transition in a way that will best ensure the long-term success of this change."
     In addition, Mr. Nelson commented, "We are pleased to announce the board of directors authorized a program allocating an additional $300 million in company funds to repurchase shares of Apollo Education Group Class A common stock."
 
     Consolidated degree enrollments for University of Phoenix and Western International University's Axia College at November 30, 2005, increased by 19.4% to 286,800 students compared to 240,200 students at November 30, 2004. Consolidated degree enrollments of online students increased in excess of 30%. Consolidated degree enrollments for our Other Schools segment (excluding Western International University's Axia College) at November 30, 2005, increased by 3.4% to 28,600 students compared to 27,600 students at November 30, 2004. We believe consolidated degree enrollments were impacted by approximately 3,000 students as a result of Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Wilma.

In exchange for Mr. Nelson's promises set forth herein, including the full waiver and release of all potential claims, including claims of personal injury, the Company agrees to:
In exchange for the promises of the Company set forth in Paragraph I above, by execution of this Agreement, Mr. Nelson releases, on behalf of himself and his heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, any and all claims of any nature whatsoever against the Company and its parent corporation, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, officers, owners, directors, employees, insurers, and assigns, with respect to any matter arising prior to the date of his execution of this Agreement, including any and all claims or causes of action arising out of the employment of Mr. Nelson by the Company and his separation from that employment. This includes, without limitation, all rights or claims arising under the Civil Rights Acts of 1964, as amended, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Older Workers' Benefit Protection Act of 1990, the Arizona Civil Rights Act, the Arizona Employment Protection Act, the Arizona Constructive Discharge Act or any other applicable state or federal statute, or any common law cause of action, including claims for breach of express or implied contract, wrongful discharge, tort, personal injury, or any claims for attorney's fees or other costs.

Mr. Nelson shall, however, continue to have the benefits provided a former Director for indemnification per the Articles and By-Law of the Company.
FULL WAIVER AND RELEASE
In exchange for the promises of Mr. Nelson set forth herein, by execution of this Agreement, the Company forever waives and releases any and all claims of any nature whatsoever against Mr. Nelson which it has, or may hereafter have, arising out Mr. Nelson's employment by the Company and his separation from that employment.

As soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Mr. Nelson will convert his Apollo Group, Inc. Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock.
The parties agree not to issue any disparaging or derogatory statements about the other, including without limitation, comments about Company officers, owners, employees or products.
Mr. Nelson agrees that for a period of two years from the date of this Agreement he will not, either directly or through others, solicit or attempt to solicit any employee of the Company, its parents, subsidiaries, or affiliates to terminate his or her relationship with the Company, its parents, subsidiaries, or affiliates in order to become an employee or consultant of any other person or entity.
Mr. Nelson agrees that for a period of one year following his separation of employment with the Company, he will not accept a position with any organization that provides educational services in competition with those provided by the Apollo Group, Inc. or its subsidiaries, whether as a principal, consultant, employee, or otherwise. For an additional one year, Mr. Nelson agrees that he will not accept any such position with the following organizations: Career Education Corp.; Corinthian Colleges; DeVry; ITT Educational Services; or Strayer Education. Just as his former position with the Company was national in scope, so too are the restrictions contained in this paragraph.
The parties understand and agree that during the course of Mr. Nelson's employment with the Company, he learned certain trade secrets and other confidential and/or proprietary information relating to the Company, its products and investors. As used in this Agreement, "Confidential Information" means any and all tangible and intangible information whether oral or in writing or in any other medium, relating to the management, financial aid policies and procedures, operations, products, intentions, plans, goals, objectives, inventions, records, financial condition, financial results, and financial projections of the Company. Mr. Nelson agrees not to disclose or use any of the Company's proprietary or confidential information or trade secrets for his own benefit or for the benefit of any third party without the written permission of the owner of the Company, or as required by law.
The parties agree that all aspects of this settlement and the negotiations leading to the amount paid, are confidential and may not be disclosed except to their respective tax advisors, legal counsel, corporate representatives and/or regulatory and governmental agencies with a need to know and/or as required by law. Mr. Nelson may also disclose such information to his immediate family.
The parties agree that if a Court of competent jurisdiction finds that a party has breached any of the material terms of this Agreement, then the non-breaching party will be entitled to any and all relief available at law or in equity, including appropriate injunctive relief.
Mr. Nelson is advised to consult with an attorney prior to executing this Agreement.
By his signature below, Mr. Nelson affirms that he will be given at least twenty-one (21) days within which to consider this Agreement.
Mr. Nelson may revoke this Agreement at any time within seven (7) days following his execution of the Agreement. This Agreement shall not become effective or enforceable until the foregoing revocation period has expired.
If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable for whatever reason, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless continue in full force and effect without being impaired in any manner whatsoever.
At the core of this Agreement is Mr. Nelson's commitment not to commence any legal proceeding against the Company. A counterclaim shall not be deemed to mean Mr. Nelson has commenced a legal proceeding. The Company has agreed to pay Mr. Nelson a significant amount of money in return for this commitment. Therefore, if Mr. Nelson breaches his commitment and commences a legal proceeding against the Company, he agrees that he will first repay the Company all amounts he has received under the terms of this Agreement.
The construction, interpretation and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Arizona and no action involving this Agreement may be brought except in the Superior Court of the State of Arizona or in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona.
This Agreement constitutes the sole and entire Agreement between the parties hereto, and supersedes any and all understandings and agreements made prior hereto, including but not limited to, the Employment Agreement between Mr. Nelson and the Company. There are no collateral understandings, representations, or agreements other than those contained herein. No provision of this Agreement shall be amended, waived or modified except by an instrument in writing, signed by the parties hereto. It is understood and agreed that the offering of this Agreement by the Company is not to be construed as an admission of any liability on its part to Mr. Nelson, other than to comply with the terms of this Agreement.
Mr. Nelson hereby represents that he has read and understands the contents of this Agreement, that no representations other than those contained herein have been made to him to induce or influence his execution of the Agreement, but that he executes this Agreement knowingly and voluntarily and upon independent legal advice of his own choosing.

(OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS)
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Apollo Group Inc. fiscal 2006 second-quarter preliminary results conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.. And as a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, February 28, 2006 and may not be reproduced in whole or in part without permission from the Company.
There will be a taped replay of this call available through March 17, 2006 beginning approximately two hours after we conclude today. The replay number is 800-642-1687 or 706-645-9291 internationally. The conference ID for the replay is 6057706. Additionally, this call will be broadcast over the Internet and can be accessed via the company's website at www.apollogrp.edu.
I'd also like to remind you that this conference call contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to the future performance of Apollo Group that involve risks and uncertainties. Various factors could cause the actual results of the Company to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in the Company's 10-K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. John Sperling, Acting Executive Chairman of Apollo Group. Dr. Sperling, go-ahead please.
Dr. John Sperling
- Apollo Group  Acting Exec. Chairman
Good morning, everyone. As most of you are aware, the Apollo management team is in the process of reinventing Apollo to meet the challenges of the 21st century global economy. And I must say I'm very excited at being back and being part of the process. These changes include the demographic changes that deal with the emergence of the baby boomers or sometimes called echo boomers or Gen Y, the economic changes that are shrinking the middle-class, jobs are being shipped overseas and more and more of the American workforce has to be educated or individuals confine themselves to lower class status.
And with all that there's the inability of public institutions to fully meet the needs of the echo boomers. So there's a lot of real possibilities out there. And repositioning the Company to meet these challenges we've merged various on ground and online corporate functions, information technology, call centers, marketing, academics, and legal and compliance and we've achieved that since January 9th.
Brian Mueller, our new President, is now making the operational changes that will allow him to demonstrate his skills at leadership, innovation and ability to drive growth. And I think, as all of you know, there's plenty of evidence for this. When he assumed control of online it had 6,000 students and today it's over 150,000. We're confident that Brian will provide the leadership that will allow these merged entities to function with maximum efficiency, at the least cost and in the process improve both the top and the bottom lines.
At this time I'm turning the meeting over to Brian who will discuss his strategy and tactics for addressing these 21st century challenges. And as usual, Brian will be followed by Kenda Gonzales who will provide the financial and accounting details. I want everyone to welcome Brian to the future of Apollo Group. Brian?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
Thank you, John. Good morning to everybody. Sorry we got started a little late, but we had people still lined up to get into the queue. So again, good morning. This is not the way I would have liked to start my tenure as President of Apollo, but the reality is we have been unable to make our revenue goals for five consecutive quarters. It's time to make aggressive investments and strategies designed to return us to the path of consistent and predictable revenue numbers.
To do this we must confront a number of realities. One, we are now over 300,000 students and to combat the challenge of the law of large numbers we need to address very assertively new markets. Secondly, Apollo was built on the back of the baby boomers and as a group they are now 50 plus years old and have moved past the need for higher education. There are, of course, millions of middle managers who enter the education market every year and we will continue to address that market and increase our market share. The echo boomers have taken place of the boomers and they will be a main source of our growth over the next five years.
The economy of the country has changed in the last five years; the middle-class built on huge numbers of manufacturing jobs is disappearing at the same rate those jobs went offshore. In the future we expect that a higher percentage of high school graduates will have to go to college, but they will have greater financial need than in the past. We're taking all of these realities into account as we move forward in the second half.
Before I continue with the echo boomer strategy let me address the reasons for the downward guidance you read in the press release. One, we took a conservative approach to advertising and the hiring of enrollment counselors in the first quarter and especially in the last month of that quarter, November. That caused us to get off to a slow start in December and January from a new start perspective.
Secondly, we did not build breaks in many of the schedules of our students during Thanksgiving and Christmas; an unusually high number of students took the entire holiday off. We experienced a $17 million revenue shortfall in December which was completely unexpected. A large majority of the students who took breaks came back in January and February, but we were unable to make up that $17 million December shortfall.
Thirdly, because our conversion rate of level one leads has increased dramatically, the percent of all students that are in the Axia program is higher than initially expected. As we move through the year our total revenues and revenue per student will improve as Axia grads move into University of Phoenix with no additional marketing costs.
In summary then, it's the conservative advertising spend in the first quarter, the December outs, and the higher percentage of lower revenue Axia students that account for the revenue shortfall. But the vast majority of the shortfall is really in the December outs phenomenon.
On the expense side there are three items I think worth mentioning. One, we have spent very aggressively in advertising for the months of January and February with the resulting strong lead flow the last six weeks, especially for on ground enrollment counselors. I have directed campuses that are understaffed to staff appropriately to address what will continue to be, we believe, a strong lead flow.
Secondly, we rolled out a new compensation plan for enrollment advisors and we took a slight hit in wages and salaries as compared to the previous year. However, we have experienced a 50% decline in enrollment advisor turnover as compared to the prior year which is very positive for us from a long-term perspective.
Thirdly, our bad debt is still at quarter one levels. We have operational plans in place related to the financial aid intake process to address that problem and expect to see improvements in the fourth quarter and especially the first quarter of next year.
Our second-half focus is on top-line growth and we are going to implement three broad strategies to focus on top-line growth in the second half. One, we are going to invest aggressively in our core business of working adults. This market is somewhat smaller and more competitive than five years ago, but we plan to increase our share of this market and, based upon the results in January and February, again an aggressive advertising spend which also included a reduction in cost per lead on the ground side which was significant, is going well and will be stepped up throughout the second half.
Secondly, we are going to hire enrollment advisors aggressively in the fastest-growing ground markets, especially in the Northeast, the Southeast and the Midwest, where our programs are in their earliest stages of development.
Thirdly, we are the process of upgrading all telephone systems in the local campuses to prepare for the qualifying center implementation.
Fourthly, we are accelerating the completion of the technology in the qualifying center.
Fifth, we are accelerating the centralization of the hot transfer distribution process to be implemented throughout the country sometime in the beginning of the fourth quarter.
Sixth, we are adding bachelor's degrees in psychology and communications which are high demand degree program areas, and we will begin offering them as soon as we have received approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities. We are also in the beginning processes of adding a masters degree in psychology and one in social work.
Seventh, we are rolling out our S-3 scheduling system to all local campus academic counselors, which will increase their ability to retain students, also allow them to more efficiently enroll students into online if they can't attend their local classroom.
Those seven things that I just mentioned are all part of the first strategy going forward in the second half which is to strengthen our share of the core business which, again, is obviously working adult students average age 35 years old.
The second major strategy involves the echo boomers and it will be to invest aggressively in the development of that echo boomer business. I think it is important to note that nothing that we do here will detract from our focus on our traditional working adult marketplace. Our heavy investment in our online program, which began all the way back in 1999, has created the infrastructure necessary for it to be successful and very, very scalable.
We already have over 40,000 Axia college students who are currently entry-level students to higher education. There will be significant investment associated with the more aggressive rollout in advertising, specifically to echo boomers, and the training of the local campus staff to deal with those students.
For the second half Axia College will only be offered in an online format which we believe will be the delivering modality most in demand by those students. The exact activities in the second half from an Axia perspective will be the following  one, we will bring Axia College under the UOP umbrella by April 1st; secondly, we will accelerate the rollout of Axia to the local campuses, this means primarily training the local campus enrollment advisors; thirdly, we will accelerate the advertisement of Axia to the beginning of the fourth quarter; fourth, we will continue to build the systems and process flows to transfer Axia grads to UOP bachelor's programs; fifth, we will add five new associate programs bringing the total to 11 by the end of the fiscal year.
We expect the overall retention rates of our Axia college students to be consistent with retention rates of our overall student body for the following reasons  one, the associate programs are delivered completely online and can be completed in a period of 20 months. Echo boomers are very comfortable with the technology and are increasingly looking for educational options that are lifestyle based. A program that lets them work while going to school allows them to enter higher education in a way that keeps their current lifestyle intact and to finish in a very reasonable amount of time. This opportunity comes at a time when demand will be at an all-time high and when community colleges and state universities will be unable to get the funding to meet the demand. For example, it is estimated that California alone will be 400,000 seats short in their community colleges in the next couple of years.
Secondly, with regards to retention rates of Axia College students, we are going to offer high levels of academic support. Faculty members will be available asynchronously throughout the week, but are required to have office hours Monday through Friday from 4:00 to 8:00 PM and from Sunday from 5:00 to 9:00 PM. That amounts to a potential of 180 hours of real-time contact with faculty per course if the student requires that time to be successful. In addition, our academic counselors will be communicating with the students on a weekly basis early in their program to ensure that they are adjusting appropriately to college life. We believe that our understanding as a leader in the online education world combined with a natural inclination of echo boomers to spend more of their time online is a great combination.
The third major strategy for the second half involves a partnership that was just completed last night; it involves an agreement with Advertising.com which operates the largest interactive advertising network in the world. We have entered into a highly strategic relationship with this wholly-owned subsidiary of America Online in order to gain an even greater advantage in the highly competitive education space. The combination of Advertising.com's world-class optimization technology and front-end combined with our capital resources, qualifying center and salesforce will give us the potential to continue to lead the industry.
In addition, as part of this agreement we will work together on a plan to leverage AOL and Time Warner assets to enhance our marketing and develop our curriculum. We feel very strongly about this relationship and the position that it puts us in and in the next number of weeks I will be talking more about the details and what it means at a tactical level.
We are continuing to look at acquisitions in Latin America and in China. This is a priority for the organization but not a priority for the second half. The priority for the second half is to put the Company in a position to grow domestically at levels that will again increase our top-line growth. In order to get there we are making some significant changes and aggressive investments and for that reason we are not giving guidance for the third and fourth quarters at this time. We believe that what we are doing is setting up a very successful future, but it is enough change that to provide guidance would be difficult. Our plan is to resume providing guidance as soon as we understand more about the exact nature of these changes.
That concludes my presentation and I'm going to turn it back over to the operator for questions.
QUESTION AND ANSWER
Operator
(OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Sara Gubins, Merrill Lynch.
Sara Gubins
- Merrill Lynch  Analyst
Good morning. Can you give us any sense of the magnitude of incremental spending that you're talking about for the second half, both from an advertising and marketing perspective and then from the various initiatives that you mentioned? Just a general sense would be helpful.
Kenda Gonzales
- Apollo Group  CFO, Sec., Treas.
Sara, we have, as Brian indicated, not been able to provide guidance for the third and fourth quarter and I think what you're asking me for is guidance for the third and fourth quarter from that perspective. So it's going to be more aggressive than it's been previously. But I don't think we can give you any magnitude at this point.
Sara Gubins
- Merrill Lynch  Analyst
Okay. Can you tell us about how many enrollment advisors you're planning to add over the second half?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
Yes. I would say if you look at where we're planning to add them, which are in those areas where we have the greatest potential growth, it would be up to around 100.
Sara Gubins
- Merrill Lynch  Analyst
Okay. And then just a last quick question, can you give us any sense of whether during the course of the second quarter you had enrollment growth on ground?
Kenda Gonzales
- Apollo Group  CFO, Sec., Treas.
We haven't provided the enrollment numbers yet. I don't have final numbers for the quarter yet since the quarter just ends and we don't have a final count yet, so I really can't answer that question today.
Sarah Gubbins
- Merrill Lynch  Analyst
Okay, thank you.
Operator
Mark Marostica, Piper Jaffray.
Unidentified Speaker
Good morning. This is Ajay for Mark, Mark's out of the office. On the selling and promotion  or on the spend lines, just to put it in perspective, are we going to go back to more historical levels in the mid-20s or is it going to be exceeding that in terms of S&P spend as a percentage of revenue? Just trying to get a perspective, I understand you're not guiding there, but how can we put it in perspective?
Kenda Gonzales
- Apollo Group  CFO, Sec., Treas.
Again, as soon as we have that information we'll provide guidance for the third and fourth quarter.
Unidentified Speaker
Okay. An additional question I have; regarding the shortfall, just to be clear, was that based on land-based students or was that both online and land-based who are taking breaks or accelerated breaks over the winter?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
That was mainly online students both on the UOP side and the Axia side.
Unidentified Speaker
Just two quick follow ups. Regarding bad debt expense, you mentioned that you'll see a recovery in, I think, Q4 to Q1 07. Will there be an acceleration in bad debt over the next few quarters?
Kenda Gonzales
- Apollo Group  CFO, Sec., Treas.
No, there won't be an acceleration of bad debt. If you're talking about our write-off policies and how we reserve, we don't anticipate any acceleration, but the natural policy for write-off or reserving of bad debt is based on an aging of those receivables. So we do anticipate that it will be at elevated levels through the third quarter which we've previously talked about and said it will start to improve into the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of next year.
Unidentified Speaker
Okay. And lastly, I'll just end with this. I know you talked a lot about plans for incremental spend; how about plans to rationalize any costs? Where are you in terms of your capacity utilization at the current point and what might you be able to do to reduce some of your costs on the campus side?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
Well, there's a number of things. As we roll out the ability of the enrollment counselors at the on ground campuses to sell both online and Axia, we believe that there will be a natural market trend for students to increasingly want to do a greater portion of their academic work online, especially in the heavily populated areas of the country where there is overcrowding and traffic problems, congestion, etc. Those are also the places where we have the most expensive leased space.
Over time, because we only lease our space and don't own it, we'll be able to grow our student body populations in those heavily populated areas without taking on additional space. And as we put students to a greater percentage, we believe in the online program, another policy if the margins are higher there. So that would be one area that we're going to be able to leverage cost.
Another very significant area is with regards to advertising. We were the first ones into the Internet advertising business. We kind of created the cost per lead model; the cost per lead model has served us well. But we're now entering the next phase of efficiency with regards to Internet advertising and that is to optimize and move to more of a cost per acquisition model and that could represent over the course of next year especially, some savings for us.
Unidentified Speaker
And based on what you've just said, do you have any plans for any facilities consolidation based on your current announcement?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
Any facility consolidation that we will do  in fact, we've already started to do some of that and we will continue to do that as enrollment counselors increasingly find that the demand for people to do stuff online, if that continues to increase, we will continue to work on those consolidation plans. We're in good shape from that standpoint.
Unidentified Speaker
Thank you.
Operator
Jerry Herman, Stifel Nicolaus.
Jerry Herman
- Stifel Nicolaus  Analyst
Brian, I was wondering if you could shed a little more color on Axia first on a technology perspective. Are you guys where you need to be? In other words, is your technology far enough along to appeal to that younger student? And secondly, maybe could you update us on the matriculation rate of those students into UOP? And with regard to the leverage in the model, I understand that you guys would garner efficiencies on student acquisition, but can you talk about some of the offsets, i.e. the support services that you alluded to and what ramifications that has for margins?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
Yes, let me talk first about the technology. Yes, we are. We are very confident that the way we deliver online education with an emphasis on community building, its emphasis on flexibility and convenience, the emphasis that it has on a student being able to access education and have it be lifestyle based fits very, very well with the needs of younger students who are going to need to work and go to school at the same time.
We've just started implementing our online learning system version 3 which is a completely Web-based system which will make it even more convenient and more efficient for students to participate in our online programs. And so we feel very confident that we are on track in a very good place to service their needs. And early indications are that it will go very, very well.
The second item you mentioned was with regards to .
Jerry Herman
- Stifel Nicolaus  Analyst
Matriculation.
Kenda Gonzales
- Apollo Group  CFO, Sec., Treas.
Matriculation, we really haven't had a very significant group of students transfer. There have been some that have gone currently, but not  we expect that the first large cohort that will move will move in the fourth quarter.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
And Kenda is right  the number of people that have graduated are still small, but the percentage of them that are graduating from Axia is very, very high. And remember, we haven't done any Axia College advertising. And so, the thousands of students that we have in Axia all came to us as a result of responding to University of Phoenix advertising with the intent of earning a baccalaureate degree. And so it would be natural that we would expect that those percentages of students that complete Axia would transfer at very high levels into The University of Phoenix.
Jerry Herman
- Stifel Nicolaus  Analyst
Before you go on to the next one, is there some assumption that you guys have? Is there some target level that you have with regard to that matriculation?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
Yes, absolutely. We can't share that at this point, but we have a very specific target in mind in terms of both the number of students that enter Axia and the target in terms of those that graduate and also then or the percentage of those that will transfer into University of Phoenix. We have very specific targets and we at this time have no reason to believe we won't achieve those targets.
Jerry Herman
- Stifel Nicolaus  Analyst
And the last question I had was just the acquisition costs or efficiencies and the offset to that?
Kenda Gonzales
- Apollo Group  CFO, Sec., Treas.
From a student support standpoint in the early (multiple speakers). It goes to retention.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
Absolutely. Let me respond to that, that's a good question. The first one is from a faculty standpoint, and I think the question would be if we're going to be a very faculty intensive with regards to providing support for our students  mainly those 180 hours of contact with the faculty that are possible in those nine-week Axia College courses, we are not paying extra for our faculty members to be involved with the students in that additional way. So there's no negative cost from that standpoint and what we are doing from an academic counseling standpoint, there's no negative cost there as well. We're building all of that in the current cost infrastructure for both faculty and academic counselors.
Jerry Herman
- Stifel Nicolaus  Analyst
Great. And then just one final follow-up there. You mentioned you're moving to a cost per acquisition model. Is that basically the nature of the Advertising.com relationship?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
Yes, absolutely. We have worked with them for a lot of years. They are very much an acknowledged leader from the standpoint of having the largest Internet network and also having extremely sophisticated technology on the front end. Our ability to combine with them, as they have the most sophisticated technology, tracking technology, etc., so that we can get very granular with regard to knowledge about prospects that are interested in our programs, combined with our ability then to run those leads through a call center and get them out to the most appropriate enrollment counselors based upon that student's needs.
If you put that continuum together and the entirety of that continuum, we think we're bringing the two strongest organizations on the back end and the front-end together. And that will bring us into a new era with regards to being efficient from an advertising start perspective.
Operator
Greg Cappelli, Credit Suisse.
Greg Cappelli
- Credit Suisse  Analyst
It's Greg and Steve. This is backwards not forward-looking this question, so perhaps you could give us a little thought here or a comment here. Why did you actually increase the spending and selling promo into Q? Is that something that you can talk about? I'm not asking you what you're going to spend the rest of the quarter, but how much more was the increase?
Kenda Gonzales
- Apollo Group  CFO, Sec., Treas.
Again, Greg, we haven't closed the books yet, so I don't have exact numbers today. So I really would prefer not to give a number today. Once we close the books and finish our accruals and finalize numbers for the quarter we'll report those numbers on March 23rd. And those would be the actual. I know we have increased it, as Brian indicated, but I don't know the exact number from that area at this point that I want to quote on.
Greg Cappelli
- Credit Suisse  Analyst
Ok, fair enough. Brian, do you expect  so the increase that you had in 2Q, would you expect that it will level off to the increased level from 2Q or you will continue and invest at higher levels for the remainder of the year? In other words it will accelerate further?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
Yes, we began accelerating in January.
Kenda Gonzales
- Apollo Group  CFO, Sec., Treas.
So we didn't have the whole quarter, Greg.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
But we continued that acceleration in February. And if you're asking are we going to continue to accelerate in the second half above those levels, I think there's the possibility that we will do that. We will watch it very carefully from the standpoint of return, but if we are getting the return, we will continue to make the investment, we will not back off from that standpoint.
Greg Cappelli
- Credit Suisse  Analyst
Brian, how do you think about returns off of the investment you're getting from that? How do you look and measure that?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
You know, it's a moving target and there are a number of ways. Obviously as we move into the second half we'll look at the traditional measures, we'll look at what our cost per lead is. We'll look at what conversion rates are. We'll look at what the total volume is. And even if we would see our cost per lead which is right now going down, we're reinvesting that money so that we're getting more leads, we're not spending less but because the cost per lead is going down  we'll continue to reinvest that money and spend up to the limit and we'll continue with those being the major measures.
However, if we're finding that as we get into it more specifically, especially with Advertising.com, that we spend more on leads that come from certain spaces, from certain areas and those things convert at a higher level, if it requires more spend and if the volume that we get in relationship to that is appropriate we'll continue down that road.
Greg Cappelli
- Credit Suisse  Analyst
Okay, I understand. You just mentioned lead costs again, how are you guys managing to get the lead cost out? Can you talk a little bit more about that and what's going on there?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
Yes, a couple things. The major one is that we have combined the marketing departments. We've got now with what, in the past, was two separate marketing departments, we've combined that by now. That gives us more leverage in the marketplace and it gives us the capability of working at higher levels with specific Internet providers, lead providers. We have also spent time getting affiliates that have worked through partners in the past to work more directly with us. They're very happy to do that, that has cut out the middleman in certain cases and allowed us to both decrease the cost per lead and increase the volume. And the three or four months of work that we have done on that now will fit nicely into what we're going to be doing with Advertising.com.
Greg Cappelli
- Credit Suisse  Analyst
Okay. And when you do increase the spending and selling of promo, what's  historically how long does it normally take to start showing up in the results? You said you were already starting to see some results. Can it be as long as a six-month process to get the full impact from it?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
Yes, I think you'll see the major impact come in the last two months of the fourth-quarter.
Greg Cappelli
- Credit Suisse  Analyst
Okay, great. Just a couple more quick ones. On the stronger lead flow you're seeing already, is that mostly coming in the area of Axia in terms of the flow?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
It's coming in two areas. One, it's coming in the area of  believe it or not it's coming in the area of leads that we are getting to ground-based enrollment counselors. We have expanded the zip code areas and the reason we did that was because in those campus areas, in those marketplaces where enrollment counselors can sell a student into both online and on ground, rather than restrict the zip code areas to a reasonable distance from the learning centers we've expanded knowing that if an enrollment counselor can work with a student who may be a little bit out of the area to make it convenient to attend, they can put them in online. So that's the biggest area that we're getting growth and success in.
Now as it relates to what percent of those leads then would we refer to as level one leads, students entering with fewer than 24 credits and then being Axia College students? We know exactly what those percentages are on the online side, we are just now starting to gather that information on the ground side and we'll know more about that in a couple months. I don't expect it to be much different than we experienced in online, but we'll see once we've got the information collected.
Kenda Gonzales
- Apollo Group  CFO, Sec., Treas.
Greg, remember that those leads really at this point, very few of them are what we would call the echo boomers. They're really level one leads but they're more in the Gen X area than the echo boom area.
Greg Cappelli
- Credit Suisse  Analyst
Okay, I understand. If somebody does sign up a student from a campus into the online program, will that then be considered an online student or a campus-based student that's taking a program through online?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
That will be considered a campus-based student. And so you're asking a good question there. We're not taking the incentive away from the local marketplace to be in charge of their local marketplace and in charge of the growth in that local marketplace. We're not taking that incentive away from them. And so if they enroll a student into our online program, that student counts for that campus, the student stays on that campus from the standpoint of us from a revenue recognition standpoint and from the standpoint of servicing that student. And so this change in strategy is very much a win for the local campuses and for their capabilities in growing their marketplace.
Greg Cappelli
- Credit Suisse  Analyst
One quick final one. I appreciate you taking the time to answer these. On the pricing front, pricing in Axia, obviously it's a discounted tuition level. Is it fair to say there's unlikely to be any pricing power for you guys from the lower base until we get into perhaps July of next year when we're supposed to get these level increases in financial aid? And on that same note, do you have pricing power right now with the working adult segment that you're obviously  you talked about aggressively still investing in? Thanks.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
Yes, Greg, if loan limits are raised next summer, which there is every indication 
Kenda Gonzales
- Apollo Group  CFO, Sec., Treas.
Actually summer of 2007.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
 2007, correct. That would give us significant areas to increase tuition levels for entry-level students would be obviously very helpful. But the major way that we are thinking about experiencing tuition increases in the future  there is some room at the three and four level, there is some room at the graduate level. And again, there will be room at the Axia College level when the loan limits go up.
But if we are successful, and we believe we will be, at getting a certain percentage of our Axia College students to graduate with an associate degree and then transfer into the University of Phoenix, there is a huge potential there to experience a tuition increase. They will experience a significant tuition increase. They'll be under the loan limits and then obviously there is no marketing and sales expense attached to that new student into the UOP baccalaureate program which is very positive from a P&L standpoint.
Greg Cappelli
- Credit Suisse  Analyst
Thank you very much.

Kelly Flynn

I just wanted to revisit Greg's question. I'm wondering if there's any way you could give us as broad as you're comfortable with ranges of where you think gross profit margin could come in versus selling and promotional for the quarter?
Kenda Gonzales
- Apollo Group  CFO, Sec., Treas.
Kelly, I really can't. There is a reason we've suspended guidance at this point and I really have a fundamental issue with providing it based on preliminary numbers that we have today and I just think that we will provide it, we will reinstate it just as soon as we can. But today I can't give you that information.
Kelly Flynn
- UBS  Analyst
I was talking about for the second quarter, not for the .
Kenda Gonzales
- Apollo Group  CFO, Sec., Treas.
Well, the second quarter we will release in about three weeks.
Kelly Flynn
- UBS  Analyst
Okay. And can you just confirm  does the new guidance include the severance expense?
Kenda Gonzales
- Apollo Group  CFO, Sec., Treas.
Yes, it does. That is a GAAP expense, so Todd's severance, I can give you that number, because that was a number that we already know. From an expense standpoint, we will be expensing roughly $32.7 million.
Kelly Flynn
- UBS  Analyst
Okay. Because I know there are some tax issues. I mean, on an EPS basis what is that going to be for the quarter?
Kenda Gonzales
- Apollo Group  CFO, Sec., Treas.
The severance number?
Kenda Gonzales
- Apollo Group  CFO, Sec., Treas.
Yes, about $0.11. We had previously disclosed that in our 8-K filing.

Okay. As we look forward, Brian, you've talked a bit about the marketing, but are there any investments that you expect to make in teacher headcount or general infrastructure that could put pressure on the gross margin in the second half relative to the first half?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
Technology? Technology infrastructure will be an investment. It is not going to put heavy pressure on margins. Other than that, no. From an instructional standpoint as a percent of revenue, we don't expect that number to go up or there to be any pressure from that standpoint. And one of the things that we feel puts us in a great position is that really everything that is necessary to scale a program online to address the needs of a new market are in place.
And from a faculty recruitment standpoint, a training standpoint, from the online learning standpoint and its scale, technical support, those things are all in place and scalable as we experience growth. So there is some investment, but other than from a marketing enrollment standpoint, we don't expect there to be undue pressure on the margins.

Good morning. As you look to the increased spending that you're describing, is it fair to consider that some of that will now be directed towards Axia specifically? I know you haven't been marketing Axia as a brand before now.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
Yes, it will, but it will not be till closer to the beginning of the fourth quarter. But as we get websites in place and as we get enrollment counselors across the country trained, a higher percentage of them trained, we will at some point be getting a certain percentage of our spend addressing that younger group of people, but it won't be until closer to beginning of the fourth quarter.
Trace Urdan
- Robert W. Baird  Analyst
Brian, I'm wondering if you can help me understand a little bit better the leverage that you were describing in bringing the two marketing departments together, because my understanding of the third-party lead vendors is that they tend to operate under an auction system. And in that scenario, basically wanting from them more leads would actually drive a higher price rather than a lower price. Can you help reconcile that mode with what you're describing in terms of getting more power over those vendors?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
Well, yes, that is a great question. This whole marketplace has grown up in the last number of years, and we have leveraged it to our advantage in most cases, but in some cases we have not. We have allowed them to leverage it to our disadvantage. And the things like selling leads to multiple institutions and those kinds of things, those are the things that have crept into the industry. Now when you begin to manage it more closely and when you begin to leverage your total buy in the marketplace, which we have aggressively in the last three or four months, you can start to root out some of those practices and in fact get that turned around and we have.
And part of that is our success in January and February. But to take that to the ultimate level in order to maximize your spend in that marketplace you have to have front-end systems that allow you to do that. Advertising.com has got the best in the world. And so even though we've made progress and it has had an impact, in order for us to get where we want to get, which is not a little bit good but very, very good to root out a lot of that stuff, and make it so that  certainly we don't want to be unfair about it, but we're going to make sure that those kinds of practices don't work in our disfavor.
Trace Urdan
- Robert W. Baird  Analyst
That's very helpful, thank you. And then the last small question I have is I'm wondering if you're starting to, or feel the need to, make any provision for job placement with respect to the folks who are coming in on a two-year basis?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
No, good question. We're going to make sure that as we brand Axia College of the University of Phoenix, and again that will happen on April 1st, that this is very much higher education, it's not vocational, it's not technical, it does not involve a job placement, will some of the programs allow that entry level student into the workplace, into the workforce, will it make them more employable? Yes, it will. Will we sell it from that standpoint? Primarily, no.
Primarily we will sell it from the standpoint of it is a tremendous way to enter higher education in a way that you can see a goal that is 20 months out, not four or five or six years out and is a tremendous way then to stay in your local community, live at home, maybe move in with some friends, but do it in a way that allows you to maintain your lifestyle, get it done in a reasonable amount of time and then transfer into a baccalaureate program that will, for the most part, be University of Phoenix. But no, we're not going to get into the job placement arena.

Gary Bisbee

A couple of questions if I could. Now that you've been dealing with the mix shift to Axia for I guess a little more than a year, can you give us some sense as to what percentage of your students historically or the leads coming in the door are actually those for whom Axia would be a good fit? In our randomly calling some of your reps we get the sense that if you raise price as an issue they're pretty quick to turn towards offering you Axia given that the substantially discounted tuition. What percent ultimately could migrate to that over time?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
If you overlay our leads and what we know because we've been tracking it on our online leads for 18 months or so, if you overlay that with what you see the trend is demographically in the country at large you find there to be a very, very strong correlation. And so to be specific, we're in the vicinity of 50% of all of our leads that are coming in are students who are entering a higher education, many for the first time, or if not the first time they have very low numbers of credits to transfer. But that's not a surprising phenomenon. That's to be expected. That kind of overlays what's happening demographically in the country.
Our ability to offer this program at this price point and spread that reduction in tuition over our vast student body puts us in a position to respond to that with minimum negative impacts on our financials that institutions that are far smaller would have a very difficult time doing. So we think from a strategic standpoint it's the right move, it matches up with what is the potential and possibility in the marketplace and we have the ability to do that in a way that maybe some of our competition with far less numbers to spread that decrease over could not do.
Gary Bisbee
- Lehman Brothers  Analyst
Would it then be correct to think about this, that if you're somewhere between 40,000 and 60,000 students today, or a quarter or something of your  or less than a quarter, a third of your total students that we should expect this mix shift to continue until you're 150,000 in each the Axia and UOP or is that not how you see the math working?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
Obviously the most important criteria there is how successful are we in getting those students to graduate and transfer into the University of Phoenix and we have very specific metrics there. In the first 18 months obviously it's all upside at Axia because nobody is graduating. As we then are successful in graduating students into the University of Phoenix's baccalaureate programs what you're going to find is that population again going up and the Axia College population leveling off because it's not a matter of just putting them in they'll be graduating.
And so we have an idea as to what we expect. We have specific metrics that we are moving towards; the exact percentage will depend upon how successful we are. And as we move forward you'll learn more about that.
Gary Bisbee
- Lehman Brothers  Analyst
That's a good point. What gives you confidence that you'll be able to keep these people? I think I asked on your last call a similar question, but I'll ask it again. It seems to me going from $265 or $275 a credit hour up to $450 at the current UOP online undergrad price point, that that's a pretty massive sticker shock for these kids to handle and just go from one term to the next? Are you going to have to offer discounted pricing somehow or are you confident you can get these kids to accept that?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
Absolutely. And it's never been  you've got to remember, this is not a cash business from the standpoint of 95% of our people stepping up and writing a check on a monthly basis for their tuition. And so it's never been about nearly as much about tuition rate as it has been about a person's capacity to borrow comfortably to invest in their future. And so the sticker shock would be a good way to think about it if it was  I was up to $800 a month budgeting and all of a sudden now my budget has to go to $1300 a month in order for me to afford this and keep going, but that's not it. That's not the phenomenon that exists.
Gary Bisbee
- Lehman Brothers  Analyst
Okay. Just two quick last ones. Can you comment on any buybacks in the second quarter and also if there's any change in the Company's strategy as you look towards the second half here versus what it's been say over the last 12 months regarding the buyback program?
Kenda Gonzales
- Apollo Group  CFO, Sec., Treas.
In the second quarter, and again these are preliminary numbers we bought back roughly  and it's not over yet  but $225 million worth of shares, just over 3.5 million shares. And we have approximately $140 million left on our buyback. And suffice it to say, for now that is our preferred use of cash.
Gary Bisbee
- Lehman Brothers  Analyst
Okay. And then one last one. It may be a better question for John. Just looking at the corporate titles here, realizing that you are the interim chairman and there was not a Chief Executive Officer named, is there a search ongoing right now for a new Chief Executive Officer and any comment on what the medium-term outlook for the senior management team is?
Dr. John Sperling
- Apollo Group  Acting Exec. Chairman
I think the senior management team is functioning better than I've ever seen it function before and I see no reason to be going out there searching for somebody to come in who doesn't know the system. As you know, historically we've always promoted from within. So I think that the way we'll handle this is month by month and watch our performance and, depending on that, we might just keep the same management team right on through.
Gary Bisbee

Could you talk about the mix of marketing spending that you anticipate? You described the increased focus on your traditional UOP student? What was it in Q1? What would you anticipate that mix to be going forward again between Axia and UOP?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
Right now it's 100% on UOP. The only students that we put in Axia College are students that investigate and are interested in UOP, but we find that they would best be suited because of their experience in higher education to go to Axia. So at the current time and in the third quarter it will still be 100% money invested in the University of Phoenix growth and we'll put  and obviously once Axia College is part of the University of Phoenix and it is 100%.
Now will we in the fourth quarter start to look at websites and properties and messages that would be attractive to 19 and 20-year-olds that would fit with what their life situation is and direct them to a website that they would feel connects with who they are? Yes, we will be doing that. But the exact percentage of that I can't tell you. We'll wade into it slowly so we look closely at what our returns are. But then again, at that point you're still putting 100% of your money into University of Phoenix because Axia College is part of University of Phoenix.
Mark Hughes

Then you seem to have a  it seems like a growth goal in mind that you're going to be spending money and you may accelerate or continue to accelerate until you are satisfied.

Brian, as you go through this process of reinvigorating and repositioning the Company, how committed is the management team and how much confidence do you have in the outlook for the campus side of the business versus the online side? And specifically, any thoughts in changing the number of campuses you expect to open? Maybe shift some of those resources more towards the online side of the business?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
No. Good question, but not at all. Ultimately the efficiency of our Company and how well we do as a company is how well we maximize the total amount of human resources that we have. And what we're doing now allows us to maximize those human resources to an extent greater than we have in the past. We absolutely believe that to have  even if students choose the online delivery model more in the future, and we're going to let the marketplace determine that. But even if they do, having a local presence, having enrollment counselors and student service people and faculty and support services and physical presence in the marketplaces we are in and expanding them will continue.
And so we're very comfortable operating in both a centralized fashion with resources here servicing students as well as having them distributed and the better we get at developing technologies that connect all of those staff together the more successful we'll be operating that way. So it's a good question, but no, we're not moving away from adding campuses and supporting students from those local markets even if they choose online as a delivery model.
Chris Gutek
- Morgan Stanley  Analyst
The Axia initiative, obviously, is ramping up quite nicely, and certainly part of the attraction is the somewhat lower price there. But, Brian, as you yourself just said a few minutes ago, the students are paying for most of the tuition for these loans and, therefore, they are not necessarily that sensitive to modest changes in prices. It would seem as if the Company perhaps has under priced Axia's product, at least modestly. Is there any thought internally to raising those prices and partially narrowing the difference versus UOP?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
That's a good question. Yes, we have. In fact, we have already made the first move in that vein. In an associates program, typically there are 15 or 18 credit hours that are your professional credit hours. They are the end of the program. For example, in criminal justice there would be 18 credit hours, I believe, that are in the professional part of the program. Tuition rate for those courses is up $20 over the per-credit hour tuition rate the first what would be 42 or 45 credits. So we have already moved in that direction.
Chris Gutek

Howard Block, Banc of America Securities.
Howard Block
- Banc of America Securities  Analyst
Good morning, everybody, including John. Nice to hear your voice again. The first question is going back to your comments earlier, Brian, about the persistence rate. So are you saying that you expect the persistence of an online 20-year-old associate degree student to be equivalent to an on-ground 35-year-old bachelor's degree student?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
There are two answers to that. One, we expect a persistence rate of an entry-level student in higher education that enters Axia College at that tuition rate with that learning model and that level of academic support to be higher than the persistence rates of those students who entered our former curriculum track, price strategy, faculty support. So we know that if you compare like students, that's going to be significantly higher.
Now, can we get good enough that that entry-level student in higher education that comes in with no credits, three credits, six credits, we put them in Axia college; can we get that persistence rate to be the same as that student who came in with 60 credits or that student who came into a masters degree program? That is the goal. Will it probably be somewhere in the middle there? We don't know for sure, but I will tell you this; if you look at a 29 or 30-year-old student entering higher education for the first time, many times those students have left high school not considering themselves college-bound and not especially good high school students, and not having participated in education for a period of 10 years, that's a challenge. A lot of us in this area are dealing with that challenge.
I believe as the age moves down  we are not targeting vocational and technical school students. We are not targeting students who have struggled in high school. We're targeting those students who traditionally would have went to a community college or a state university but whose lifestyle is far more amenable to our delivery model. I think there is the possibility that we could achieve that same retention rate of that 60 credit-hour student given the higher quality student we will be attracting into Axia in the future.
Howard Block
- Banc of America Securities  Analyst
Okay, fair enough. In terms of the Advertising.com relationship, I just wanted to go back to a question I think Jerry asked earlier. And I think he asked his question and said, does this mean you'll be moving toward a cost per enrollment model. And I believe your answer was an emphatic absolutely. I just wanted to revisit that. Does that mean that Advertising.com will be getting paid only based on enrollment and not impressions or leads?
Kenda Gonzales
- Apollo Group  CFO, Sec., Treas.
No.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
No, it does not mean that. It does not mean that at all. What it means is  and it's a good question, thank you, because it allows me to clarify that. What it means is that the more intelligence we gather on the source of leads and the conversion rates of leads and from which properties, and with what creatives, and interest in what program; the more information we gather around that, the more we can direct business to those vendors who are willing to participate on a right pricing strategy, which means that we want to pay more for the high-quality high converting leads. We are happy to run the lower-quality leads through our qualifying center to hot transfer them to an enrollment counselor, but we want to pay appropriately for the quality of that lead.
Now, as you get better and better at that, does that mean that at some point you are lowering your cost per acquisition? Yes, but it is not a strictly cost-per-acquisition basis. It is more on the front end of right pricing that lead and dealing with the strongest vendors who provide us with the highest quality leads.
Howard Block
- Banc of America Securities  Analyst
Okay. Is there something in the AOL user base that scored favorably in comparing it with the ideal customer profile for either Axia or UOP?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
Don't know yet. We have been meeting with Ad.com for four or five months now. We had our first meeting last week with people from AOL and also with people with Time Warner, and we've got general language in the contract about our desire on both parts to leverage those companies, but the exact nature of that is to be determined.
Howard Block
- Banc of America Securities  Analyst
Can you just elaborate a little bit; I think you said earlier also that you were hopeful of leveraging the Time Warner and AOL assets in order to enhance marketing. Maybe I misspoke there, but I think you know the gist of what I'm trying to get at, if you could just elaborate a bit.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
Well, AOL has a huge user base, obviously. Time Warner has a huge cable network, and Time Warner also has tremendous, tremendous amounts of content that they are in the process of indexing, which kind of fits with what we are doing on our side, which is to deliver course materials electronically. So is there the potential that we will be able to leverage some of that content to the benefit of both companies in the future and also our students? Yes. Do we know what that might look like or for sure if it was going to happen? At this point, no, we've only had one meeting.
Howard Block
- Banc of America Securities  Analyst
Kenda, when you reinstate guidance, will it be to the same degree in terms of enrollment statistics, operating margin, revenue, for the current quarter as well as the full year?
Kenda Gonzales
- Apollo Group  CFO, Sec., Treas.
I know that the financial metrics will be the same as to what we have given historically from an enrollment standpoint. We will provide information at least on what we've provided the last few quarters. We are still, to be honest, Howard, struggling a little bit with, especially as Brian described today, how we are counting students that are online students at our on-ground campuses, what value that metric provides the street since that is really not how we are running our business any longer.
Howard Block
- Banc of America Securities  Analyst
I'm very respectful of the fact you can't offer any guidance for this quarter right now or even the year, but as you think maybe in terms of a three-year plan or a five-year plan, have you thought about a target operating margin? Are you hopeful of recapturing the Halcyon days, or is there perhaps going to be a tolerance for a lower profitability level on a bigger student base?
Kenda Gonzales
- Apollo Group  CFO, Sec., Treas.
We don't anticipate over a long-term lower profitability levels on a larger student base. As we are investing right now in the short-term, I think that, as we get our hands around that, that certainly could cause lower profitability in the short-term because we will have more expenses in this advertising area. But in the long-term, that is exactly what we are running the business for, and we're not anticipating that that will be lower than what we've historically achieved.
Howard Block
- Banc of America Securities  Analyst
You mentioned the introduction of the BA in Psychology and Communications. I was wondering, do you have any data that might tell us what percentage of leads may not be converting because you lack the program that they are seeking?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
No, that would be anecdotal, but we do know what the participation rates in those programs are in the higher ed structure at-large in this country, and they are very, very significant. And we don't have any reason to believe that because of the nature of the makeup of our student body that we wouldn't be able to build on the inclination to study in those areas, especially as we engage more younger students.
Howard Block
- Banc of America Securities  Analyst
Okay, so is that sort of an expressed initiative internally, is to build a course catalog that more exactly mirrors that of the overall market?

Avi Fisher

Okay, sorry about that. How does the model work is there is a gap between the Axia student going to UOP if he or she takes time off? Is that a factor in your strategy at all, your plans at all?
Kenda Gonzales
- Apollo Group  CFO, Sec., Treas.
So are you talking about if they complete their associates program and then take months or ?
Avi Fisher
- Harris Nesbitt  Analyst
Then work full-time again and then come back.
Kenda Gonzales
- Apollo Group  CFO, Sec., Treas.
Well, I would anticipate  I mean it depends on how much the time is, obviously. I mean we anticipate that they will take some period of time.
Avi Fisher
- Harris Nesbitt  Analyst
So some gap is built in.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
The reality is that as Axia college was part of WIU and because of the consortium agreement that we had, we were able to combine financial aid periods. So as you completed at WIU, it was to your advantage to continuously enroll into the UOP program from a financial aid standpoint, both from an efficiency standpoint as well as maximizing your funds that you had available to you.
As we move Axia college under the University of Phoenix, we will continue with advising students that as you enter your last academic year at Axia College, your ability to combine whatever remaining credits you have with your first number of credit hours at University of Phoenix puts you in a very strong position for continuous enrollment. And again, it is early, but we are finding that those students who are graduating are finding that to be the most attractive option, and that is to just keep going. Now, some of them are taking a break, they want a month or two off, but most of them are just saying, I will keep going.
Avi Fisher
- Harris Nesbitt  Analyst
Okay, thank you for that. I'm not sure if anybody asked this, but do you have any trends, any differences between the UOP campus and online trends for the quarter?
Kenda Gonzales
- Apollo Group  CFO, Sec., Treas.
Trends?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
Yes, we have this trend in that because we have expanded the zip code areas around our local campuses from an advertising standpoint, that we are generating more leads in and around those local campuses providing them to local campus enrollment counselors, and we are hoping that that improves their conversion rates and their productivity. That is an early trend, though.
Avi Fisher
- Harris Nesbitt  Analyst
I just have two more quick questions. What percent of your faculty are adjunct, and do you think you're going to have to convert some to full-time? Someone touched on that earlier.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
No, we have full-time faculty, but we don't expect that the number of full-time faculty needs to increase as a percentage of our overall faculty at all.
Avi Fisher
- Harris Nesbitt  Analyst
And just I think the final question, just getting back to the students who went out on break and you said a lot of them or most of them returned. I was wondering if you could quantify that or compare it to another time when students went out on break? What percent returned?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
Well, you can back into it a little bit. There was a $17 million revenue shortfall in the month of December as a result of those students taking those breaks. We are going to make an adjustment in students scheduling for next year in that holiday time period, so that we hopefully encourage students  we give them some time so that they don't feel the need to take off of class completely.

First question is just wanted to follow up on Howard's question about the persistence. Sort of reading between the lines, are you saying that at this point the Axia persistence is lower than the traditional University of Phoenix persistence?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
The persistence rates of Axia college students at the level they enter higher education as compared to the persistence level of UOP students in the past at that same level is much higher. The persistence level of those entry-level students in Axia as compared to a student who transfers in with say an associates degree or one that is in a master's degree program, it is under that, but it's much closer to that than what we experienced previously with UOP students coming in with low credits.
Corey Greendale
- First Analysis  Analyst
Can you comment on whether Axia's persistence has come down over the past couple quarters? I just had the impression that Axia on an absolute basis was persisting better than the University of Phoenix a few quarters ago.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
No. Again, there are two major advantages to what we're doing. Number one, we obviously make a huge investment in advertising. When you can get your conversion rates consistently  I mean if you can dramatically increase the conversion rates of that huge percentage of leads, that is a big plus for you. Secondly, again the persistence rates are greater than those same students at UOP and they are not as great at 60 credit hour or a master's degree student, but we are gaining there. We are not losing anything there from the standpoint of the last 12 months.
Corey Greendale
- First Analysis  Analyst
Okay. Second question is about the advertising. Can you just give us a sense from your market data, the working adult market, would you say that the vast majority of that potential market is already aware of who The University of Phoenix is and it is a function of wanting to build more equity there, or are you still at the stage of kind of making people aware of who you are?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
The awareness levels of The University of Phoenix with the research that we have done are high, but when you dig down to the next level what students actually know about the value proposition of The University of Phoenix is not nearly as high or in-depth as we would like it to be. I think you're asking a good question there, and that is that as we move forward if we can make significant gains from an advertising  an Internet advertising lead generation standpoint, will be able to funnel some money into building the brand of The University of Phoenix so that a wider array of people understand more about the value proposition? It would be our intent to do that if we can make those gains.
Corey Greendale
- First Analysis  Analyst
Are you planning on or are you changing the messaging at all, or is it just kind of the dollar amount with the same message?
Brian Mueller

The messaging will be changed subtly. We are talking about students who are working versus working adult students. So there will be subtle changes, but certainly not dramatic changes.
Operator
Jennifer Childe, Bear Stearns.
Jennifer Childe
- Bear Stearns  Analyst
Thanks, three questions. First, I know it is a small sample size, but can you tell us what percentage of Axia grads have matriculated to UOP? Second question, won't you be at a competitive disadvantage relative to your peers if you don't eventually offer job placement services for the Axia students when they complete their four-year degrees? Third, will there be any upfront costs associated with the strategic relationship with Advertising.com?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
The first question is the percentage of students who are graduating from Axia that are transferring to UOP is very high. The sample size is too small right now for me to give you a number that you could then take to the bank, so I want to avoid doing that until the sample size is large enough that I have confidence that it is a number that you can take to the bank and build your models around.
The second question around placement services, no, we don't think that that will put negative strain on us at all. We are going to position ourselves, continue to position ourselves as a higher education entity. We are not in the vocational/technical business. Some of our programs at the associate level will make students more employable. Our enrollment counselors will talk in general terms about the employment trends within areas like criminal justice and IT, for example, and have a conversation with students about that when that is of interest to them.
But we will make it very clear to them that it is not our intent to then place them into a job as a result of them finishing that associates degree. And again, we want to primarily attract those students who don't see the associates degree as a terminal degree but as a stepping stone to a baccalaureate program, because that is where the highest value is for them long-term from a career standpoint.
Jennifer Childe
- Bear Stearns  Analyst
I meant after they finish their four-year degree and not working adults. Won't you have to offer some job placement service at this point?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
No, because the students are coming to us now, and we think they will continue to come to us this way, are working. If they are younger, they are working at more entry-level situations in the workforce, but they are still working. And will they be moving  as they're with us for three or four years will they be moving inside those companies and making progress? We think that they will. So it won't work a whole lot differently than it currently works for our slightly older students.
Jennifer Childe
- Bear Stearns  Analyst
And any upfront costs associated with Advertising.com?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
A little bit, yes. There is a little bit there because we have got to merge technology systems. We have got to do a lot of learning and exchanging of information. They will be down here in force working with us for the next three months, and we are going to do a lot of work and a lot of learning and there will be some investment there, but I think it is going to pay off for us.

I will keep this quick. A question on cash flow. Is there any reason to think that in the second quarter there would be any lesser growth in cash flow than might be implied by the $0.03 EPS shortfall?
Kenda Gonzales
- Apollo Group  CFO, Sec., Treas.
No, there wouldn't be any reason to think that.
Matt Litfin
- William Blair & Co.  Analyst
All right. And then the other part of that question is with the strategic changes that you're considering in the second half of this year, does that in any way affect the cash flow characteristics of the business in your view?
Kenda Gonzales
- Apollo Group  CFO, Sec., Treas.
The characteristics would stay the same. Clearly depending on how much upfront investment we have we will use cash for that as well. But as far as my previous guidance that free cash flow should be actually should be in the neighborhood of net income, that would stand.
Matt Litfin
- William Blair & Co.  Analyst
That's what I wondered. Thanks so much.

Trey Cowen

I appreciate your stamina on this long call. With respect to expanding the ZIP code and bringing in more leads to your campuses, is there some concern there about  and I'm asking this because I know the enrollment reps  the compensation is regulated and so is there some concern there that that might dampen morale in any way if you're expecting higher conversion rates and you're throwing more leads at them and you're expecting them to be more efficient?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
It's having just the opposite effect. For the first time in a long time they have felt like they have a chance to be successful and they have a chance to do their jobs at a level that they anticipated when they were first hired. So no, the morale out there is if anything a great deal higher.
Trey Cowen
- Stanford Group  Analyst
That's good to hear. With respect to the second quarter when you're looking at the $17 million in December, can you clarify that between how much of the students that took break were online versus on the ground?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
Most of them were online.
Trey Cowen
- Stanford Group  Analyst
All right, thank you very much.
Brian Mueller

Just a quick follow-up, guys. Just a clarification. You guys are comfortable with the regulatory approvals on Axia and also the 100 enrollment counselors that you talked about earlier, Brian; that's a net number I'm assuming, net add?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
Yes.
Jerry Herman
- Stifel Nicolaus  Analyst
And the regulatory approval?
Kenda Gonzales
- Apollo Group  CFO, Sec., Treas.
We're comfortable by April 1, yes.
Jerry Herman
- Stifel Nicolaus  Analyst
And then just sort of a conceptual question for Brian  I won't ask any metrics this time. Brian, you guys have made a lot of changes and a lot of internal changes, could you maybe gauge where you think you are in either the disruptions associated with that process or the efficiency that you hope to achieve as part of that process? Using any analogy you want, what inning you're in, what percentage you have achieved?
Dr. John Sperling
- Apollo Group  Acting Exec. Chairman
Let me break in here and just say that I've seldom seen the attitude of the employees higher than it's been since we made this change. The organization has really come alive in a way that I hadn't seen it for years. So as far as the changes are concerned, I would say they've been simply not disruptive at all. They've been eagerly awaited for and eagerly adopted.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
I would echo John's statement that the morale of our people is up. There is a strain on the people that are working out of our online campus from the standpoint of them being on the road and out in the campuses as we do the things we need to do to bring the two organizations together to operate as one.
There's a little bit of a financial strain there and there's a strain from the standpoint of how much effort is going into that. But I would say because of that effort and how well those people are doing that, the negative impact on the efficiency of the people that actually have to do the work to implement the change as they work with students has been minimized.
In terms of the inning, I would say we're probably in the bottom of the fourth, possibly in the top of the fifth, but there's no outs in the top of the fifth. We may be halfway through it.
Jerry Herman
- Stifel Nicolaus  Analyst
Okay. Thanks very much.
Kenda Gonzales

And operator, I think we have time for just two more calls and then we're going to need to wrap this up  it's been a long one.

Kirsten Edward, ThinkEquity Partners.
Kirsten Edwards
- ThinkEquity Partners  Analyst
Thanks for taking my question. When does the Advertising.com agreement go into affect? And what percentage of the ad budget is that going to be? And then can you give us a big picture of what you expect the number of the vendors you're using now versus what you think it will be a year from now?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
We'll be using a large percentage of the vendors that we are currently using and we'll be using the best vendors of those that we're currently using and their opportunity to work with us and grow their business will be increased and not decreased by this relationship. Those people that are not good vendors and not good producers obviously won't in a good situation, but the vast majority will be in an even better situation than they are now. That was the second question, though. What was the first one?
Kirsten Edwards
- ThinkEquity Partners  Analyst
When does it go into affect?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
This week  what's today (multiple speakers-28th). We will begin  they will be down here as quickly as we can get them here and we will be working very hard over the next three months.
Kirsten Edwards
- ThinkEquity Partners  Analyst
Okay. And will this relationship account for the majority of your advertising budget going forward?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
I can't answer that. Is a huge percentage of our lead generation activity on the Internet? Yes, it is. Will a large percentage of those leads go through the technology of ad.com so that we can get more granular with regards to our strategies? Yes. How much of it will appear on the ad.com network versus come from outside of that? That's to be determined based upon the results that we experience.
Kirsten Edwards
- ThinkEquity Partners  Analyst
Okay. And then one very quick one. When you start managing the migration process as associate students near completion, is that going to be the admissions reps handling that process or are you going to have to add more people in the fourth quarter or third quarter when that's the crucial period?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
No, that's a really good question. Right now we've added just a little bit because of the WIU and UOP thing. Once Axia College comes under The University of Phoenix we will be organized in a slightly different way which will allow a student to work with basically the same people. And so there will be no additional costs associated with that. In fact, there will be a significant reduction in cost because we won't be paying for any marketing or sales associated with that student becoming a baccalaureate student.
Kirsten Edwards
- ThinkEquity Partners  Analyst
Okay. So it is the enrollment reps that will be handling that?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
No, it will not be the enrollment reps. It will be the academic counseling people and the financial counseling people who will deal with those students.
Kirsten Edwards
- ThinkEquity Partners  Analyst
Thanks a lot.

Stephen Barlow

Thanks. When you talk about the advertising agreement, you talked about an upfront charge, would that be in the second quarter we're finishing today?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
It's not really an upfront charge.
Stephen Barlow
- Prudential Equity Group  Analyst
Payment?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
And I can't give details of the contract today; I'll the releasing more information about it as we move forward. It's not really an upfront charge and there will be some impact in the third quarter and maybe some impact on the fourth quarter. Exactly how much time it will take us to see that thing turn and for us to get a great deal more efficient is yet to be determined, but we'll work as hard as we can at that and make it happen as soon as possible.
Stephen Barlow
- Prudential Equity Group  Analyst
And on the Axia sample size that we all keep on asking about, do you know what quarter would look like the biggest lump there that would make the sample size large enough to get a feeling of how many go on to UOP?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group  President
Fourth quarter.
Stephen Barlow
- Prudential Equity Group  Analyst
Fourth quarter 06, your fiscal fourth quarter?
Brian Mueller

Yes.
Stephen Barlow

Okay. And there have been lots of ads in the New York City on the radio for UOP. Are you accredited now in New York and Connecticut and opening campuses there or is this just for New Jersey?

These three primary strategies include investing aggressively in our core business of working adults, further developing the echo boomer business and leveraging our strategic relationship with advertising.com. We have already seen progress in these key initiatives and are excited by the many growth opportunities that lie ahead."

In response to the report, and as part of its normal Corporate Governance practices, the Company performed a review of its stock option practices, including reviewing documents and interviewing employees. Based upon this review, the Companys initial conclusions are as follows:  The grants included a large number of employees and not just senior executives.  Management believes that it has complied with all applicable laws, including the accelerated Form 4 filing requirements mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, in granting options to officers and it has not backdated options.

Board of Directors Apollo Group, Inc. c/o Elizabeth Brem, Esquire Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, LLP 4 Park Plaza, Suite 1400 Irvine, CA 92614-8557
VIA FEDEX
Dear Board of Directors:
     This firm represents Larry Barnett (the "Stockholder"), a holder of shares of common stock of Apollo Group, Inc. ("Apollo" or the "Company"). I write on behalf of the Stockholder to demand that the Board of Directors of Apollo (the "Board") take action to remedy breaches of fiduciary duties and other misconduct by the directors and certain officers of the Company, as described herein.
     As you are aware, by reason of their positions as officers and/or directors of Apollo and because of their ability to control the business and corporate affairs of Apollo, the officers and directors of the Company owe Apollo and its shareholders the fiduciary obligations of good faith, loyalty, and due care, and are required to use their utmost ability to control and manage Apollo in a fair, just, honest, and equitable manner. The Stockholder believes that all the members of the Board (collectively, the "Directors"), particularly the members of the Compensation and Audit Committees, violated these core fiduciary duty principles, causing Apollo to suffer damages.
     The Stockholder contends that for several years the Board, in violation of Company's stock option plans, improperly backdated grants of stock options to Apollo officers, including John G. Sperling, Todd S. Nelson, Jorge Klor de Alva, Jerry F. Noble, Kenda B. Gonzales, Anthony Digiovanni, and Laura Palmer Noone (collectively, the "Officers"), and improperly accounted for the backdated stock option grants in violation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
 
     The Stockholder maintains that each of the Directors breached their fiduciary duties by: (i) knowingly approving the Company's foregoing improprieties, and/or (ii) abdicating their responsibility to make a good faith effort to oversee the Company's operations and internal controls; and that the Officers were unjustly enriched by their receipt of backdated stock options. As a result of the foregoing breaches of duty, Apollo has sustained damages, including, but not limited to, loss of funds paid to the Company upon exercise of backdated stock options, and costs and expenses incurred in connection with Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice investigations of the Company and its stock option grants.
     On behalf of the Stockholder, I hereby demand that the Board take action: (i) to recover from the Directors and Officers the amount of damages sustained by the Company as a result of the misconduct alleged herein, (ii) to recover from the Officers the improperly awarded stock options, and (iii) to correct deficiencies in the Company's internal controls and equity compensation practices.
     If within a reasonable period of time after receipt of this letter the Board has not taken action as demanded herein, the Stockholder will commence a shareholder derivative action on behalf of Apollo seeking appropriate relief.

The delay in the filing of this report is a result of the previously disclosed ongoing investigation by the Company's Board of Directors in response to a report that questioned whether the Company has backdated four stock option grants during fiscal 2000-2004.
As a result of this notification, the Company's common stock is subject to potential delisting from The NASDAQ Stock Market. The Company intends to formally request a hearing before the Panel to appeal the NASDAQ Staff's determination, which will automatically stay the delisting until the appeal has been heard and the Panel has rendered its decision. Pending a decision by the Panel, the Company will remain listed on NASDAQ.

Item 4.02 Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
(a) As previously announced, a committee of independent members of the Board of Directors (the "Special Committee") of Apollo Group, Inc. (the "Company") has been conducting a review of the Companys historic stock option granting practices. The Special Committees review is being conducted with the assistance of independent counsel and accounting advisors. Although the review is continuing and a final conclusion has not been reached, the review has identified various deficiencies in the process of granting and documenting stock options. As a result of the deficiencies, certain measurement dates related to stock option grants will need to be revised and adjustments to historical financial statements will be required. These deficiencies include the following:  In the accounting of certain stock option grants, the Company did not correctly apply the requirements of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. In certain instances , the Company used a measurement date for option awards that corresponded with the reported grant date even though the approvals for those grants as set forth in the operative plans were not obtained until after the reported grant date and the final list of grantees and award amounts was incomplete at the time of the reported grant date.  The Company misapplied Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) with respect to the contemporaneous tax treatment of certain stock option grants and may face significant tax liability for prior years.  The Company prepared and maintained inaccurate documentation concerning the date that grant award lists were completed and approved. The Company is still conducting its accounting analysis and has not yet determined definitively the impact of these deficiencies on the Companys historical financial statements. However, the Company expects that it will restate certain of its previously filed financial statements, including for the years 2001 to 2005 and the first two quarters of 2006. Accordingly, on November 2, 2006, based on the work of the review to date, the Companys Board of Directors has concluded that the Companys previously issued financial statements and other historical financial information and related disclosures relating to periods discussed above (as well as earnings releases for the last two quarters of 2006) contained in the Companys filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including applicable reports of its independent registered public accounting firm and press releases, should no longer be relied upon. Upon completion of the Special Committees investigation, the Company will prepare and file with the SEC amendments to certain of the Companys previous filings with the SEC reflecting the restatement of its consolidated financial statements. The Company is working expeditiously to complete its review and at that time will complete and file these amendments as soon as possible. The Companys audit committee chairman has discussed the matters in this filing under Item 4.02(a) with Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm.
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers.
On November 1, 2006, Kenda B. Gonzales resigned as the Companys Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, effective immediately. The Company will hire an interim CFO as soon as reasonably possible. On November 2, 2006, Daniel E. Bachus, the Companys Chief Accounting Officer and Controller, was placed on administrative leave. A copy of the press release issued by the Company announcing the foregoing is attached as Exhibit 99.1, and is incorporated herein by reference.

Apollo Group, Inc.
News Release
Phoenix, Arizona, November 3, 2006  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOL) today announced that its ongoing internal investigation into the issuance of certain stock option grants has discovered various deficiencies.
While not yet complete, the investigation to date has identified various deficiencies in the Company's process of granting and documenting stock options, which are described in greater detail in the Company's Form 8-K filed today. Apollo Group therefore will need to restate its historical financial statements to record additional charges for compensation expenses relating to past stock option grants. The Company has not determined the amount of such charges, the resulting tax and accounting impact, or which periods may require restatement. Accordingly, Apollo Group today filed a Form 8-K and plans to file any required restated financial statements following completion of the investigation. The Company continues to cooperate with the SEC.
"We are committed to resolving these issues as quickly as possible, and we are in the process of putting the appropriate processes in place to ensure this does not happen again," said Brian Mueller, who was appointed president of Apollo Group in January.
Apollo Group also announced that Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Kenda B. Gonzales resigned on November 1, citing personal reasons. In addition, Chief Accounting Officer Dan Bachus is currently on administrative leave.
st
"Transition is always challenging for an organization," commented Mueller. "However, we have a talented and tenured executive team in place and I feel confident in our abilities to move the organization forward. Our focus remains on doing what's right for our students, our faculty and our employees. I remain committed to the turnaround plan I outlined for shareholders earlier this year and I believe we have made significant progress towards building the infrastructure for our future growth."

Item 8.01 Other Events.
(a) During a conference call held by Apollo Group, Inc. (the "Company") on Friday, November 3, 2006, the Company responded to certain questions related to the investigation being conducted by the Special Committee of the Company's Board of Directors concerning options practices at the Company. To date, the Special Committee has found no direct evidence that the grant date for any of the large management grants was selected with the benefit of hindsight. In two instances, though, the price on the grant date is at a relative low point for the Companys stock, and there is little contemporaneous evidence to establish that the grant was made on the grant date. While there is a possibility that the grant date was retroactively selected, there is insufficient evidence at this time to reach such a conclusion. The investigation is ongoing. The Company hopes to complete the investigation and any needed accounting corrections by the end of the year, so that Q1 2007 financials can be issued on a normal ba sis. There is no assurance, however, that this schedule will be accomplished. To the extent that other accounting issues were identified in that investigation, the Company refers investors to its Form 8-K filed on November 3, 2006.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
As previously reported, on December 22, 2005, the Department of Education Office of Inspector General issued an audit report regarding University of Phoenix policies and procedures for the calculation and return of Title IV funds for withdrawn students. The report found that University of Phoenix had adequate policies and procedures in all areas, but took issue with the methodology used to determine the percentage of Title IV aid earned. On November 3, 2006, the Department of Education issued a preliminary audit determination requesting additional documentation from the Company for the period of March 1, 2004 through December 7, 2004. The additional information was requested within 30 days, but the Company will request an extension of time due to the large number of records involved. The Department of Education has estimated that it could assert a refund liability of at least $3.7 million, based on a limited sample of student records. Depending on the outcome of the records review to be conducted and th e resolution of Company legal challenges to the views of the Department of Education, it is possible that the ultimate refund liability could be substantially more than the Department of Educations estimate. The Company has not yet estimated the amount of reserve that may be required; however, any such reserve is likely to be recorded in fiscal year 2006 or possibly prior periods.

Item 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
On December 14, 2006, Apollo Group, Inc. (the "Company") notified the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel (the "Panel") that the Company will be unable to file its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended May 31, 2006, its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2006, and all required restatements, by the December 29, 2006 deadline set forth in the Panel's September 20, 2006 decision letter. The Company requested that the Panel grant a reasonable extension to file those reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") such that it will regain compliance with the NASDAQ Stock Market's filing requirements.
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
The Company announced via press release the resignation of the Chairperson of the Compensation Committee, John R. Norton III, 78, from the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board"), effective December 8, 2006. Mr. Norton stated that it had been his intention not to stand for reelection at the Companys Annual Meeting of the Class B Shareholders. This Annual Meeting generally occurs in January, 2007. In light of the fact that the meeting has not yet been scheduled, Mr. Norton preferred not to continue his term into 2007. On December 8, 2006, the Board appointed K. Sue Redman, 49, to serve as a director of the Company. Ms. Redman has been the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Texas A&M University since 2004. From 1999-2004, she served as Vice President, Finance and Corporate Controller of AdvancePCS, a pharmaceutical benefits manager and health improvement services company traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market. Prior to 1999, Ms. Redman was a partner with PricewaterhouseCoo pers LLP. She is a Certified Public Accountant, and holds a B.B.A. in accounting from Texas A&M University. Ms. Redman has also been appointed to the Board's Audit Committee and Compensation Committee. In addition, Ms. Redman has replaced Hedy F. Govenar as a member of the Special Committee, effective December 8, 2006. This change in membership of the Special Committee was prompted by an order issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, in which three shareholder derivative suits involving the Company are pending. The plaintiffs in those cases have filed complaints on behalf of the Company alleging that certain of the Company's current and former officers and directors engaged in misconduct regarding stock option grants. These derivative complaints were filed after the Company announced the formation of the Special Committee and the commencement of its investigation, and the Company has moved the Court to stay these actions pending the conclusion of the Special Committee s investigation and review of plaintiffs' claims. On December 4, 2006, the Court issued an order in the case captioned Alaska Electrical Pension Fund v. Sperling, Case No. CV06-02124-PHX-ROS, stating that the Companys motion to stay the proceedings would be granted upon notice that Ms. Govenar had been replaced on the Special Committee by another board member who was not a party to the case. In light of the Court's ruling, Ms. Redman has joined the Special Committee in place of Ms. Govenar. Now that the Special Committee has concluded its factual findings, the Special Committee anticipates that the Board will request that it analyze, in light of the investigation, whether the pursuit of these shareholder derivative cases would be in the Companys best interest. Also on December 8, 2006, Dino J. DeConcini, a current member of the Companys Board, has been appointed to the Boards Compensation Committee and will serve as its Chairperson.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
Stock Option Investigation On December 8, 2006, the Special Committee of the Board and its independent counsel and accounting advisors investigating the Company's historic stock option grant practices presented their final factual findings to the Board. The Special Committee's factual findings were largely consistent with earlier, interim factual findings reported to the Board, a summary of which was disclosed by the Company as part of its Current Reports on Form 8-K dated November 3, 2006 and November 6, 2006. These interim factual findings were:  In the accounting of certain stock option grants, the Company did not correctly apply the requirements of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. In certain instances, the Company used a measurement date for option awards that corresponded with the reported grant date even though the approvals for those grants as set forth in the operative plans were not obtained until after the reported grant date and the final list of grantees and award amounts was incomplete at the time of the reported grant date.  The Company misapplied Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) with respect to the contemporaneous tax treatment of certain stock option grants and may face significant tax liability for prior years.  The Company prepared and maintained inaccurate documentation concerning the date that grant award lists were completed and approved.  The Special Committee has found no direct evidence that the grant date for any of the large management grants was selected with the benefit of hindsight. In two instances, though, the price on the grant date is at a relative low point for the Companys stock, and there is little contemporaneous evidence to establish that the grant was made on the grant date. While there is a possibility that the grant date was retroactively selected, there is insufficient evidence to reach such a conclusion. In addition to the informa tion previously disclosed, the Special Committee, in connection with its final factual findings, reported to the Board that certain former officers took steps that may have been intended to mask failures in the grant approval process with respect to the Companys financial reporting and payment of taxes. The Special Committee also recently discovered additional evidence that raises questions whether another grant date (in addition to the two grants referenced in the Form 8-K dated November 6, 2006) may have been retroactively selected by a day, although there is insufficient evidence to reach such a conclusion. The Special Committee also made recommendations to the Board regarding improvements in option grant practices and internal controls as well as broader governance reforms. The Company and the Boards Compensation Committee have revised certain of its option grant practices and procedures, and are reviewing the recommendations of the Special Committee with the expectation of m aking further changes. As a result of the Special Committee's findings, management believes that the Company had a material weakness in its internal controls over the process of granting stock option awards during years covered by the special investigation. The Company's 2006 Form 10-K will further describe the material weakness along with planned remedial actions that are being taken, which include, among other things, hiring of a new Chief Financial Officer and improving controls and processes. The Company is working expeditiously to complete and file with the SEC amendments to certain of the Companys previous filings reflecting the restatement of its consolidated financial statements as well as file its Form 10-Q for the period ended May 31, 2006, and its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2006. At this time, the Company is unable to determine when such filings will be made. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Based on management's review o f the Companys actual write off experience for the fiscal years ended 2000 to 2006 relating to accounts receivable, the Company has concluded that it has understated its allowance for doubtful accounts at August 31, 2006. The Company is continuing its analysis and, based upon its most recent information, expects to record a pre-tax, non-cash increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts and the associated bad debt expense of approximately $34 million. The Company currently believes that a significant portion of this amount relates to years prior to 2006; however, the Company continues to refine the amounts and is in process of estimating the amounts, if any, which might be recorded in prior periods. Such amounts are subject to change and audit. A copy of the press release issued by the Company announcing the foregoing is attached as Exhibit 99.1, and is incorporated herein by reference.

Apollo Group, Inc.
News Release
Phoenix, Arizona, December 14, 2006  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOL) today announced that the Special Committee of its Board of Directors has reported its final factual findings after a seven-month investigation into the Company's stock option practices. The Company also announced changes in its Board of Directors, a request for an extension of time to file financial statements with NASDAQ, and an increase to its bad debt expense.
Investigation Key Factual Findings
In conducting the investigation, the Special Committee of outside directors, together with independent legal counsel and forensic accountants, reported that its final factual findings were largely consistent with earlier, interim factual findings reported to the Board. The key factual findings of the independent investigation can be summarized as follows:
In addition to the information previously disclosed, the Special Committee, in connection with its final factual findings, reported to the Board that certain former officers took steps that may have been intended to mask failures in the grant approval process with respect to the Company's financial reporting and payment of taxes. Importantly, the foregoing findings do not apply to any members of Apollo Group's current Executive team. "We remain committed to resolving our accounting issues as quickly as possible," said Brian Mueller, who was appointed President of Apollo Group in January. "These issues are coming to light under my watch, and I assure you that our current management team will settle for nothing less than full and timely disclosure and resolution of all outstanding issues." The Company and its independent auditors are reviewing the findings of the independent investigation, as well as recent accounting guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), and have not yet determined the impact of these deficiencies on its historical financial statements. The Company continues to believe that it will need to restate certain of its previously filed financial statements and is working expeditiously to complete and file the necessary amendments with the SEC. However, the Company is unable at this time to determine when such filings will be made. The Company also had not yet determined the magnitude of additional past liabilities.
NASDAQ & Earnings Release
In addition, the Company has notified NASDAQ that it will be unable to file its quarterly report ended May 31, 2006 and its annual report for fiscal year end August 31, 2006 by the December 29, 2006 filing deadline, and is requesting a reasonable extension.
The Company currently anticipates that in January it will provide notice of an earnings release and conference call relating to the results of the first quarter of fiscal year 2007, although these financial results may not include all applicable adjustments that may be required under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The additional time to report the Company's earnings is in order to provide the new CFO and his team the opportunity to understand and review results while diligently working on the restatement.
Recommendations
In connection with the reporting of its factual findings, the Special Committee recommended improvements in option grant practices and internal controls as well as broader governance reforms. "These recommendations will improve corporate governance and ensure a situation like this does not happen again," said Mr. Mueller. "We are strengthening the infrastructure to support and implement our strategic plan for growth and this team is solidly committed to executing our plan."
Resignations and Appointments
Apollo Group also announced the resignation of the Chair of the Compensation Committee, John R. Norton III, 78, from its Board of Directors. Mr. Norton informed the Company that it was his intention not to stand for reelection at the Company's Annual Meeting. In light of the fact that this meeting has not yet been scheduled, Mr. Norton preferred not to continue his term into 2007. Mr. Norton served on the Company's Board for nine years, making many valuable contributions to the Company during this time.
Dino J. DeConcini, a current member of the Company's Board of Directors, has been appointed to the Compensation Committee and will serve as Chair.
K. Sue Redman has been appointed to the Company's Board of Directors, Audit and Compensation Committees. Ms. Redman is Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Texas A&M University. She previously served as Vice President of Finance and Corporate Controller of AdvancePCS, and as a partner with PricewaterhouseCoopers. She is a Certified Public Accountant and holds a Bachelor of Business Administration in accounting from Texas A&M University.
Additionally, Ms. Redman has replaced Hedy F. Govenar as a member of the Special Committee. This change in membership was prompted by a recent order by the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, in which three shareholder derivative suits filed against the Company after formation of the Special Committee are pending. The Company filed a motion to stay these proceedings pending completion of the Special Committee's investigation and on December 4, 2006, the Court ruled it will grant the Company's motion to stay upon notice that Ms. Govenar has been replaced on the Special Committee by another board member who is not party to the cases.
Accounts Receivable Bad Debt Reserve Review
Additionally, Apollo Group concluded that based on a review of its actual write off experience from fiscal years 2000  2006 relating to accounts receivable, its allowance for doubtful accounts was understated at August 31, 2006. While the company is continuing its analysis, it expects at this time to record a pre-tax, non-cash increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts and the associated bad-debt expense of approximately $34 million. The Company currently believes that a significant portion of this amount relates to years prior to 2006; however it is still in the process of estimating the amounts, if any, which may be recorded in prior periods.

(the "Company") notified the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel (the "Panel") that the Company would be unable to file its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended May 31, 2006, its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2006, and all required restatements, by the December 29, 2006 deadline set forth in the Panels September 20, 2006 decision letter. The Company requested that the Panel grant a reasonable extension to file those reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission such that it will regain compliance with The Nasdaq Stock Markets filing requirements. On December 20, 2006, the Company received a letter from the Panel denying the Companys extension request. Because the Company has not complied with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14), the Panel indicated that it had determined to delist and suspend trading of t he Companys securities on The Nasdaq Stock Market effective at the open of business on December 29, 2006 (the "Delisting Decision"). On December 21, 2006, the Company appealed the Panels Delisting Decision, as contemplated by Marketplace Rule 4807(a), and requested that the Nasdaq Listing and Hearings Review Council (the "Listing Council") review it. On December 22, 2006, the Company was informed by the Listing Council that it had determined to call the Panels Delisting Decision for review, as contemplated by Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4807(b), and had also stayed the delisting of the Company's securities pending further review by the Listing Council. No date has been set for the review. The Company may submit in writing additional information for the Listing Council's consideration by February 2, 2007. The Company is diligently working on the restatement of its financial statements following receipt by the Board of Directors, on December 8, 2006, of the Specia l Committees final factual findings of its stock option investigation. At this time, the Company is unable to predict when such restatement will be completed. In addition, the Company expects that it will be unable to file its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended November 30, 2006 by the deadline for this report since certain information included in such financial statements is dependent upon finalizing the restated financial statements.

The Listing Council's decision stays a December 20, 2006, determination by the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel ("the Panel") to delist and suspend trading of the Company's securities on The Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq") effective December 29, 2006.

such that it will regain compliance with Nasdaq's filing requirements
. On December 20, 2006, the Company received a letter denying the extension request. The Company appealed to the Listing Council on December 21, 2006.

Results of Operations
     Net income attributed to Apollo Group common stock for the three months ended November 30, 2006, was $115.6 million, or $0.66 per diluted share on 174.5 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared to $130.8 million, or $0.73 per diluted share on 180.3 million weighted average shares outstanding for the same period last year.
     Total consolidated revenues for Apollo Group for the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 were $668.2 million, a 6.3% increase over the first quarter 2006, and total student growth was 8.6% versus a year ago. The University of Phoenix, Inc. ("UOP") accounted for 91.2% of the $619.8 million in net tuition revenues from students enrolled in degree programs for the quarter ended November 30, 2006.
     Instructional costs and services increased by $35.3 million in the three months ended November 30, 2006, from the three months ended November 30, 2005 primarily resulting from increases in employee-related expenses due to the higher enrollment numbers and increases in bad debt expense.
     Selling and promotional expenses increased by $26.9 million in the three months ended November 30, 2006, from the three months ended November 30, 2005 primarily resulting from increases in the number of enrollment counselors and a significant increase in advertising expenditures.
     General and administrative expenses increased by $4.2 million in the three months ended November 30, 2006, from the three months ended November 30, 2005 primarily due to higher professional fees associated
 
with our stock option investigation and increased employee compensation costs for information technology (IT) projects.
     Commenting on the quarter, Brian Mueller, President, said, "We are pleased with our first quarter as we've made meaningful progress in our operating results as compared to the fiscal fourth quarter of 2006. When I took over as President in January of 2006, we laid out a clear turnaround plan and we have been executing well against that plan. The first quarter was further validation that our strategy is working and we are making operational improvements. We have a strong and stable management team that has never worked better as a unit and a lot of hard-working students and staff who are very committed to our goals. Apollo Group and UOP have received many awards historically for innovative practices in higher education, and over the last year we began making the necessary strategic investments to build on this innovation. We're confident that this will result in sustainable growth over the long term."

There will be a replay of this call available through February 21, 2007 beginning approximately two hours after we conclude today. The number is 800-642-1687 or 706-645-9291 internationally. The conference ID number for the replay is 8072490.
Additionally, this call will be broadcast over the Internet and can be accessed via the company's website at www.apollogrp.edu. I'd also like to remind you, that this conference call contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to future performance of Apollo Group that involve risks and uncertainties.
Various factors could cause actual results for the company to be materially different from any results expressed or implied. These and other factors are discussed in the company's press release announcing our financial results. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian Mueller, President of Apollo Group. Mr. Mueller, please go ahead.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Good morning and thanks for your attendance. We are pleased with our first quarter as we've made meaningful progress in our operating results as compared to the fourth quarter of 2006.
Before I go into detail on the results I'd like to turn the call over to Joe D'Amico, our current CFO, to review the financial performance of the first quarter and update you with regard to our accounting issues. Then I will spend some time discussing our business. Then we will take your questions. Just to be clear, however, we will not be commenting at this time on the specifics of the options investigation. Just the process we're going through to properly account for it.
As you know, Joe joined us in mid November and has been very productive over the last two months. His primary focus has been the options investigation as well as carrying out the day-to-day CFO duties, leaving me free to focus on running the business, which is an important point we want to convey in this conference. Joe's background and experience make him uniquely qualified to take on this role. And we are pleased to have him with us. Joe is a senior managing director with FTI Palladium Partners, an interim management company and a division of FTI Consulting Inc. Joe has a strong accounting background, is a problem solver and both the board and I are very confident in his abilities. Joe will give you some detail on what he and his team have done recently and then I will be back to update you on the business. Joe?
Joseph D'Amico
- Apollo Group, Inc.  CFO
Thanks, Brian. As Brian indicated, I was brought in to Apollo Group to focus on addressing any accounting implications that might result from the special committee investigation that was already in progress as well as oversee and manage the financial operations of the company.
We've made good progress in the last two and a half months since I've been here and particularly since we received the special committee's report on December 8th. I'll walk through some of the progress we've made to date and what we intend to accomplish over the coming months. And then I'll give you an update on the first quarter financials.
My responsibilities here at Apollo have been focused as follows.
First, assessing the financial situation, particularly the areas outlined in the special committee's report and getting the company back in compliance with their reporting obligations as soon as possible.
Second, implementing remedial actions to address the issues identified by the special committee.
Third, reviewing the company's financial policies, procedures and controls and make sure there aren't any other problems. And finally, managing the day-to-day aspects of the financial accounting group and handling the CFO responsibilities to support the organization.
So what have we accomplished? Once the special committee reported its financial results and even prior to that, we focused on determining what remedial actions were going to be necessary to correct our processes and most importantly prevent situations like this in the future. In order to do that, we took steps to strengthen and support the accounting and finance team.
Yesterday, we announced that the Board appointed Brian Swartz as Vice President, Corporate Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Brian has been working with me since the end of December and has been an important addition to the team.
In addition, we engaged FTI Consulting's SEC, accounting, tax, regulatory and financial specialists to provide technical assistance to help us with the restatements. We are also using other consultants and experts where we believe it is appropriate to provide independent input and analysis. As we have reported, we have a completely new Compensation Committee, made up of three independent directors and two new members that are CPAs on our Audit Committee, including the Chairperson.
The new Chairperson is Sue Redman, the CFO of Texas A&M University and previously an audit partner with PriceWaterhouseCoopers.
We've taken steps to ensure the company is receiving the best possible advice on regulatory and governance matters as well. In early January, we hired Morgan, Lewis & Bockius as our SEC Reporting, Stock Option, Tax and Special Counsel to the company.
The lead partner responsible for our work is John F. Hardigan, a highly-respected lawyer with over 30 years of experience and a former Assistant Director of the SEC Division of Enforcement.
With respect to the financials, we are in process of completing our own due diligence on the company's accounting which is what led to the discovery of the bad debt reserve adjustment that we disclosed last December. We are working closely with our external auditors so we can file the delinquent SEC reports. We're confident that we shored up our accounting reporting and control processes.
We've recently made a submission to the NASDAQ in support of maintaining our listing, allowing us the necessary time to become current with the SEC. We are planning to conclude our restatements and become current with the SEC reporting requirements by April 30th or possibly earlier. Additionally, I want to make it clear that no one in the current senior management team including Brian Mueller and John Sperling has been implicated by any of the findings of the special committee.
Now, turning to the company's first quarter performance. To begin, let me remind everyone that the comments regarding our financial statements and results in this earnings conference call are unaudited and subject to change. Additionally, all comments are qualified by the detailed forward-looking Safe Harbor and are further qualified by the limitation of financial information statement included in our press release.
Total consolidated revenues for Apollo Group for the first quarter of 2007 were $668.2 million, a 6.3% increase over the first quarter of 2006 and total student growth was 8.6% versus a year ago. Net tuition revenue associated with students enrolled in degree programs was $619.8 million, a 6.1% year-over-year increase. The University of Phoenix represented 91.2% our net tuition revenue or $564.9 million.
Discounts, which are primarily from military sales, for the quarter were $24.6 million or 3.7% of revenue.
Turning to expenses. Overall, expenses for the first quarter 2007 increased versus the first quarter of 2006. But as Brian will discuss in a few minutes, the trends are very positive when compared to the fourth quarter of 2006.
Instructional costs and services increased primarily as a result of increases in employee related expenses due to higher enrollment numbers and an increase in bad debt expense. Selling and promotional costs increased primarily as a result of an increase in the number of enrollment counselors and significant increase in advertising expenditures.
General administrative expenses also increased, primarily due to the higher professional fees associated with our stock option investigation, which were approximately $2 million in the quarter and increased employee compensation costs for information technology projects.
As a result of the above, our operating margin excluding stock based compensation expense decreased to 28.2% for the first quarter of 2007, compared to 34.4% for the first quarter of 2006.
Net income for the quarter was $115.6 million, or $0.66 per fully diluted share on $174.5 million weighted average shares outstanding, which compares to $130.8 million or $0.73 per fully diluted share on $180.3 million weighted average shares outstanding a year ago.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash, were $512.8 million at November 30, 2006.
Net receivables were $186.5 million, which includes an adjustment as of August 31, 2006, to reflect an increase of $34 million in the bad debt reserves as we previously reported. At November 30, 2006, we have reserved $64.1 million against our receivable balance and during the first quarter of 2007 we wrote off $20.2 million of student receivables.
Between November 30, 2005, and November 30, 2006, the current portion of deferred tuition revenue increased 8.8% to $129.9 million and student deposits increased 3% to $257 million. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter were $154.2 million compared to $215.6 million for the first quarter of 2006. The decrease is primarily due to a significant increase in accounts receivable and lower net income.
The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to an increase in the days sales outstanding to 36 days, as of November 30, 2006, from 32 days as of August 31, 2006. Capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2007 were $25.2 million, compared to $20.8 million a year ago. With that, I'll turn it back to Brian.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Thanks, Joe.
Before I begin, I want to thank you Joe, and Brian Swartz, our new CAO and the entire corporate accounting department because they've worked extremely hard the last couple of month to get us through, at least partially through, the back dating issue and getting prepared for this call. So thanks for all your efforts. It's really appreciated.
As I said earlier, we are pleased with the first quarter results. When I took over as President in January of 2006, we laid out a turnaround plan and we have made significant progress on that plan.
I want to remind you that the plan has four major components. One, leverage our capabilities as a leader in marketing, advertising, lead generation, branding and student recruitment.
Two, continue the innovative research that allows us to build on our already advanced curriculum, instructional delivery and academic support services to further drive increased retention rates.
Three, build a sizable pool of associate degree programs and students, and a sizable pool of high school students attending the online learning methodology in order to transfer them to University of Phoenix bachelor's programs with a goal of building growth without all the pressure of being on the marketing and sales effort.
Four, continue our organic growth internationally, as well as consider strategic acquisitions.
As you know, we have been working very hard for a year now to reverse the decline in growth that began three years ago. The higher education landscape has become increasingly competitive and as the largest player in the industry, we are dealing with a large base of students from which to grow. We had a period from 2003 to 2005 when we were too short-term focused and failed to make the necessary investments to ensure long-term growth.
Beginning in the second quarter of 2006 we began investing in more lead generating advertising, branding research, sales force expansion, new program development and market expansion acquisitions. We were particularly aggressive in our spending in the fourth quarter of 2006, which is when we hired the majority of the new enrollment counselors. While this increases our cost in the short term, we are confident that we are making the right strategic investment for our long-term growth and profitability.
First quarter 2007 results are an indication that we are moving in the right direction and a validation of our strategy. Total student growth was up 8.6% over prior year and revenues were up 6.3% over prior year, exceeding the 5.5% revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2006. Instructional costs which were 46.8% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2006 declined to 44.5% in the first quarter of 2007.
Selling and promotional expense, which was 24.6% in the fourth quarter of 2006 decreased to 23.2% in the first quarter of 2007. General and administrative costs which were 5.3% in the fourth quarter of 2006 declined to 4.9% in the first quarter of 2007. The positive gains made in all these categories allowed us to increase the operating margin excluding stock based compensation expense over 400 basis points from 24.1% in the fourth quarter to 28.2% in the first quarter of 2007.
Our revenues are tracking well in the second quarter of 2007. Albeit at a slightly slower growth rate in the first quarter due to a change in the holiday break schedules at the online campus. I want to remind you, in our business the second quarter which runs December through February is typically a lower revenue quarter because of holiday breaks. As a result, certain fixed expense items such as enrollment counselors' expense we just discussed, as well as other wage and salary categories puts some seasonal pressure on our operating margins.
Our strategy is to make improvements in operating margins over the course of the entire year and get back to 29% over time. Leads were strong in the first quarter and cost per lead was down significantly over the first quarter of 2006. After declining last quarter, conversion rates increased slightly over the fourth quarter of 2006. Our partnerships with Monster.com and ad.com continue to do well. Overall, we believe we are making progress in the efficiency of our lead generation process and gaining sophistication in our qualifying center.
These starts were up fairly significantly over the prior year in September, October and November. The close to 600 new enrollment counselors hired in the second half of 2006, predominantly in the fourth quarter are producing at about half of the productivity rate of counselors who have been in their job over one year. We expect the new counselors to continue to improve throughout the year and particularly in the third and fourth quarters. The percent of all students who were active in the quarter also increased slightly and we believe we can further improve in this area.
The 8.6% increase in overall student growth was due to a combination of new enrollment, a slight increase in active percentage, and the online campus improvements associated with the re-entry process.
Last quarter I mentioned that there were two issues which impacted student growth. The first was lower online re-entry and the second was the counselors on-campus who began recruiting for online programs had high no show rates.
We are very pleased to result that the turnaround I reported to you in September where we saw 3,000 more re-entries compared to the previous September, is continuing and contributed to the new student growth in quarter one.
To the second issue, I'm also happy to report that we continue to train our campus-based enrollment counselors. We have seen improvement in their show rates.
As expected, total student growth continues to be dominated by increases at Axia College.
Comparing to the fourth quarter of 2006, Axia grew by 12.2%, bachelor's enrollments declined less than 1%, master's enrollments increased 1.6% and doctoral enrollments increased 25%. The breakdown of our student body is neither surprising nor unexpected. It validates our understanding of the market as well as our strategic plan to address the market. In the first quarter Axia leads were well over 50% of the total number of leads. The percentage of Axia students that are graduating and are transferring remain about the same as reported at the end of the fourth quarter, but the population or pool of them is obviously growing.
Continuously improving retention rates of our students is a constant focus. As we've said many times, we believe this involves focus on the process from beginning to end, including: improving leads, training counselors, having the right curriculum, instructional strategy, and student support mechanisms in place for our students. Since we last updated you, we have opened six new academic programs and in the next six months we plan to open an additional 13 programs.
I now want to spend a minute on our recent acquisition of Insight Schools and how it fits into our larger strategy. We began working with high school students two and half years ago through our partnership with Orange Lutheran High School in Orange County, California. We converted their courses, working with their faculty so they could be delivered through our online learning systems. Orange Lutheran was excited about the learning outcomes achieved by the students and the satisfaction levels experienced by the faculty and students. That project led us to begin negotiating with Insight Schools about nine months ago and ultimately resulted in the acquisition of Insight for $15 million.
The acquisition will allow us to expand into the online charter high school market. Insight started with 650 schools [CLARIFICATION: schools reference corrected to "students" below] in Washington state in September of 2006. They have recently been approved to begin operating in Wisconsin and Kansas in September. There are currently 21 states with online charter high school approved legislation. We would like to open four to six states per year. As Axia is a bridge into the University of Phoenix baccalaureate programs, Insight will be a bridge into Axia.
Our strategy is to build up a significant population of high school students and a significant population of associate degree students who can transfer to the University of Phoenix with little or no sales or marketing expense, creating a revenue stream spanning over three to four years with what has historically been two.
Now let me touch on a topic which we are often asked about, which is how we intend to deploy our free cash flow. We are going to take a balanced approach to the use of cash. We will continue to invest in domestic growth through our current and new programs as well as domestic acquisitions.
Secondly, historically, we have often repurchased our stock and that practice will be evaluated on an ongoing basis after we become current with our SEC report filings. Thirdly, we continue to look at acquisitions internationally. Specifically, Brazil, Mexico, Chile and China. However, we continue to be selective in our approach.
To date we haven't found the right deal at the right price with the right management team. In the meantime we continue to expand our international offerings online and now have over 7,000 international students attending our University of Phoenix online programs.
Getting back to the first quarter, bad debt expense decreased from 4.3% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2006, excluding the previously estimated $34 million adjustment to 3.8% in the first quarter of 2007.
As I indicated in the fourth quarter of 2006 earnings conference call, we did invest heavily in advertising expense during the fourth quarter of 2006, predicting that we would get the student growth necessary to decrease advertising as a percent of revenue in the first quarter of 2007. As predicted, advertising as a percent of revenue was 11% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and declined to 9.8% of revenue in the first quarter of 2007. The reduction in cost per lead allowed us to implement our nationally televised branding campaign which began airing in January without increasing advertising expense as a percent of revenue.
It's obviously very early to judge the results of a campaign designed to be measured over time, however, we are satisfied with the early results and the feedback. Our first broadcast commercial debuted during the BCS Championship game on January 8 which was of course played at the newly named University of Phoenix stadium. The combination of the TV ad and the stadium name exposure led to a significant spike in leads on the days following the game and we saw another spike in leads following the Fiesta Bowl on January 1st, which also took place at the University of Phoenix stadium.
th
We are looking forward to the 2008 Super Bowl being played at the University of Phoenix stadium. We recognize that it is too early to call this a trend, but we are certainly pleased with the initial tracking. The fundamental objective of this campaign is to increase recognition and image to ultimately create higher lead conversions.
Overall, the first quarter was a positive one for us and we are making meaningful progress toward our goals and seeing operational improvements.
We have a strong and stable management team that has never worked better as a unit and a lot of hard working students and staff who are very committed to our goals. I would personally like to thank all our employees for their commitment and hard work. Also, I would like to thank our entire shareholder group for your continued commitment and support while we get current with our public securities filings.
Finally, as you know, Apollo Group and University of Phoenix have received many awards historically for innovative practices in higher education. And over the last year, we began making the necessary strategic investments to build on that innovation.
We are confident that this will result in sustainable growth over the long term. With that, I'd like to open the call to your questions.
I want to make one point of clarification. I think that I said, inadvertently, that we have 650 Insight School locations. I meant to say we have one Insight School location with 650 students and plan to open four to six new locations per year. Thank you for pointing that out. That would be a lot of students at 650 locations.
QUESTION AND ANSWER
Operator
[OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS] Your first question comes from Sara Gubins with Merrill Lynch.
Sara Gubins
- Merrill Lynch  Analyst
Thank you. Good morning.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Good morning.
Sara Gubins
- Merrill Lynch  Analyst
First question, can you give us an update on your plans or current thoughts on the national pricing strategy?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
We're working hard at it. We're continuing to model that out. As Axia College becomes a larger percentage of our student body, it becomes more and more likely that we're going to be able to do that in a revenue neutral way. As most of you know the Title IV loan limits for level one and level two students go up on July 1st so that's a date we're targeting. We might move a little bit earlier than that. If we're able to do it in a revenue neutral way, then we would obviously hope to see positive results in terms of lead conversion and also student retention.
Sara Gubins
- Merrill Lynch  Analyst
Okay. So it's not a definite yet, but you're still looking at it seriously? Yes. Okay.
You mentioned domestic acquisition plans. Can you talk a bit about what kinds of things you're looking at? Is it more online high schools, or is it more in the post secondary area.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
We're very excited about the online charter high school process that we're in. We're very excited about Insight Schools. It's very much a growing trend in the country. We'll be a first mover for the most part from the standpoint of our ability to scale.
The fact that we've got two and a half years of experience teaching high school students in that online environment gives us a lot of confidence we can be successful doing that. Yes, we're also considering a private high school that would be an online high school and there are other things that we're looking at. But not prepared to give any information about those things right now.
Sara Gubins
- Merrill Lynch  Analyst
Okay. Last question. Then I'll turn it over. The enrollment numbers look like they were restated again after last quarter and restated down pretty significantly. Can you explain what the change was versus what had already been changed in the prior quarter?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Yes, we've been moving through a process over the course of the last 12 to 18 months of automating the student count and we really completed the automation process fully for all University of Phoenix and Axia College students in the fourth quarter of last year. And used that automated account to count our students in the fourth quarter and those were the numbers that we produced.
One of the things that we just missed at that point was that historically, and really over the last 12 to 24 months, a bigger part of our business has become single course registrations, students all over the world really taking courses on a one off basis because of whatever need they have. Some of those students got included in that count in the fourth quarter. So that was reversed and we feel like now we're in a position to get even more consistent as we move forward with that student count number. You probably have noticed that we have also excluded IPD and WIU and CFP students because we haven't been able automate the count with those students in the same way that we automated the University of Phoenix students. That is what that accounts for.
Sara Gubins
- Merrill Lynch  Analyst
Okay. Thank you very much.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President

Your next question comes from Jerry Herman with Stifel Nicolaus.
Jerry Herman
- Stifel Nicolaus  Analyst
Thanks, good morning, everybody. Just wanted to ask sort of a high level question since you've now been President for about a year. Can you share your expectations on what you believe to be a reasonable range of enrollment growth for the company on a sustainable basis?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Well, we're not giving guidance and so I will tell you that we have talked a lot about our goal being to return to 10% overall growth rates at 29% margins, possibly a little higher, and I've stated that repeatedly over the last six months that that's a goal. We are moving in that direction and we are  as I have also said, we are only going to put in place strategies from a growth standpoint that we believe are sustainable over the long-term.
And so we're looking to return to 10% and 29% or 30% margins in a very methodical way only implementing strategies that we believe are sustainable over the long-term.
Jerry Herman
- Stifel Nicolaus  Analyst
And that's the 10% is enrollment growth, just to be clear?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
I'm sorry. No, the 10% is revenue growth.
Jerry Herman
- Stifel Nicolaus  Analyst
Okay. Very good. Okay. That answers part of my next question with regard to revenue growth. Can you gauge when the influence of Axia will normalize on revenue comparisons?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
I think it's getting closer all the time. There are still things that we are watching very carefully. The conversion rate because of Axia College and because of the learning methodology and the tuition rate, those things are increasing.
The total amount of time a new student spends with us as a result of Axia College is significantly higher than the total amount of time a student spends with us when we had put them in the University of Phoenix program, which has a slightly different learning methodology and obviously higher tuition rates. So in the short run, we're already making progress.
Now, again, the things that are most important with regards to all this is at what point do we stabilize around graduation rates, transfer rates and then persistence rates at the University of Phoenix. We are pleased with the initial results. We are very confident that we can be effective teaching students in the environment that we're putting them in. We're going to continue to work hard at it.
We believe that we have significant advantages in that instructor-led small group very interactive, very collaborative, highly supportive environment as opposed to the environment many of those students would find themselves in at a state university, for example, in a lecture hall of maybe 400 students with a single instructor.
And so I understand that that's a little bit controversial in terms of people's opinions with regards to that. We have confidence that we're going to be successful teaching these students at a very acceptable rate.
Jerry Herman
- Stifel Nicolaus  Analyst
Great. Thanks. And then just one final item. Are you guys in a position to provide the year-ago quarterly automated census numbers, second and third quarter?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Yes, we will and we'll report them in second quarter.
Jerry Herman
- Stifel Nicolaus  Analyst
So, you're not going to provide the bench marks for the second and third quarter in advance of the release of the second and third quarter, I mean for last year, actually.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
We weren't planning to do that. But we're taking that into consideration and Brian Swartz is working on that right now.
Jerry Herman
- Stifel Nicolaus  Analyst
Great. I appreciate it. I'll turn it over.

Your next question comes from Greg Cappelli with Credit Suisse.
Chris Unidentified
- Credit Suisse  Analyst
Hi, guys, this is actually Chris on for Greg today.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Hi, Chris.
Chris Unidentified
- Credit Suisse  Analyst
Just a couple questions here for you.
First of all, obviously it looks like enrollment growth or enrollments, rather, have had a nice bounce off the bottom from last quarter and I was just wondering, can you help me understand a little bit better the makeup of the total number this quarter? Can we sort of assume maybe a new enrollment growth in the 3% to 5% range this quarter? Does that seem like a reasonable estimate?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
We're not giving out those numbers, and so I'm not going to respond to that directly, other than to say what I said in the call, which is that new enrollments were up significantly over first quarter of prior year.
Chris Unidentified
- Credit Suisse  Analyst
Okay. And then the actual revenue per student growth this quarter, given that you're not providing consolidated enrollments, is it fair to assume that that was  it looks like it was down about 2%. Is that about accurate? The revenue per student growth.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
That's another number that we're not giving out now. But I guess the best answer to that is that number is stabilizing. But we're really not giving that information out.
Chris Unidentified
- Credit Suisse  Analyst
Okay. And one final one, Brian. You talked about the new programs being rolled out. Can you just talk about what area those are in and maybe what degree level?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
It's pretty balanced. There are a number of new programs at the associate degree level. We have a couple programs at the baccalaureate level. One or two at the master's level.
We have applied to be approved for the first time to offer PHD programs and we're waiting on the response from that. We anticipate that it will be favorable, which would put us into a new market. So it's fairly balanced over the entire scope of the levels we teach at.
Chris Unidentified
- Credit Suisse  Analyst
What kind of PHD programs are they?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
We're not going to comment on that right now. We haven't been approved. We're in the application process.
Chris Unidentified
- Credit Suisse  Analyst
All right. Thanks.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Marostica with Piper Jaffray.
Mark Marostica
- Piper Jaffray & Co.  Analyst
Thank you and good morning. My first question relates to your comments, Brian, about the February quarter where you are seeing slower enrollment growth than you saw in the November quarter. And I'm curious, is that across the board in terms of programs, meaning associates, bachelors, masters and doctoral, or is it concentrated in any one area?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
You need to clarify, slower enrollment growth, I think you must have misunderstood something that I said. Can you repeat the question?
Mark Marostica
- Piper Jaffray & Co.  Analyst
Yes, maybe I did misunderstand. And I thought that you had said that the February quarter thus far was indicating decelerating enrollment growth compared to the November quarter.
Brian Mueller

Oh, I got you. I'm sorry. Yes, I was speaking about revenue there and the comment that I was making was that two years ago, and some of you know the history of this, two years ago we decided that we were going to take the breaks out of student's schedules during the holiday season. Students had indicated an interest in graduating sooner. And that was at the online campus.
That really had a negative impact on our performance in that quarter. Students decided to take off that entire time period. We put those breaks back in, in the second quarter of this year and we had more students stay, but you're experiencing three weeks of revenue on those students versus five weeks of revenue. So the overall impact in that second  there was a little bit of a overall impact in that quarter from a revenue standpoint.
Obviously we think that was the right move because now we don't have to work hard to get those students back into the program and we think we'll make the positive gains in the third and fourth quarter. So it's not a major thing, but there is a slight blip there as compared to prior year as a result of that change.
Mark Marostica
- Piper Jaffray & Co.  Analyst
Okay. Got it.
And then this quarter I noticed that the bachelor and master's degree enrollments I believe were down year-over-year. Of course associates driving the model. But what do you think it's going to take to turn the quarter on bachelor's and master's?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
The bachelor's degree area, there's a number of things that will happen over time there. As we build that pool of Axia College students to be larger, as we make gains from the standpoint of graduation and transfer rates into the baccalaureate programs, that's going to naturally make that a shift take place there. We also want to add some programs at the baccalaureate level.
At the master's degree level, more programs are necessary, but also a great deal more flexibility from the standpoint of the individualization of those programs, allowing students to select from a wider variety of courses, especially in our MBA and other management programs. So that they can become more personalized. Very difficult to do that when you're building through primarily a ground-based infrastructure because you've got class size and faculty issues, but very doable when you are moving in a direction of putting more and more students into the online program, because obviously now you're recruiting on a national basis and you're forming groups and recruiting faculty on a national basis.
Mark Marostica
- Piper Jaffray & Co.  Analyst
And last question and I'll turn it over. What are your hiring plans for enrollment counselors over the next couple quarters? Thanks.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
We believe that we are pretty close to where we should be. Maybe a little bit behind, given lead flow. We think that we are now in a position that we will regulate that very carefully.
So, that we know where the leads are coming, we know what areas of the country they're coming in and we will be able to hire enrollment counselors based upon lead flow and based upon where things are happening in the country and it is our intent not to under invest there, not to get behind. But we should not be in a situation in the future where we have to make that huge investment in one short period of time in order to make up for the fact that we kept holding off for a couple years.

Your next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.
Jeffrey Silber
- BMO Capital Markets  Analyst
Thanks so much. I hate to go back to the enrollment restatement, but I just want to make sure that I understand. Is there going to be any impact or should have there been any impact on restating the income statement because of this enrollment restatement?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
No.
Jeffrey Silber
- BMO Capital Markets  Analyst
Okay. And again, I'll put my vote in if you could give us the historical restatement that will help us model going forward. I appreciate that.
During the quarter I guess over the past few months I guess Intel had made a decision not to include you in their reimbursement policy. I'm just wondering if that's had any impact on your business. Do you see any other companies doing the same thing? If you could comment on that I would appreciate it.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
No, not at all. We've been through this with Intel now, this is the third time. It's a very good company. We've had a very good relationship with them over the years. Our programs are extremely popular with their employees. We kind of dominate their tuition reimbursement budget because of how popular our programs are with their employees. They're not going through the greatest times economically and this is a way to cut back a little bit I think. But I think the most important thing is that they are a technology company.
The thing that drives their business is engineering. We don't have engineering programs, but our programs are very popular because of the ease of accessibility and convenience and as a result of that, we have a lot of students I think that they would prefer being in engineering programs that are in our business management and technology programs. Last time we went through this with them, we actually went out and created a program called an MBA program in technology management that they were very satisfied with.
They actually participated with us in the production of that program and we'll continue to work with them on some innovative programs potentially at the associate's degree level.
We've had a couple discussions with them about that, that may be of help to them as they put new people into their fabs. That's obviously purely speculative, but we'll continue to work with them, try to add value to what they do if we can. That's not something that we've experienced with any other companies at this time.
Jeffrey Silber
- BMO Capital Markets  Analyst
And just one more. I believe you commented on cost per lead trends. If you could give us some color on costs per start and lead conversion rates.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Well, we're making progress and we're very happy with the progress. I think we made the most progress in the second quarter. We eliminated 10 or 12 vendors that were producing very low conversion rates and driving up our cost per acquisition.
Eliminating them in December produced very favorable results for us in January and we expect that to continue in February. And so we kind of reached an apex with regards to the number of leads we're purchasing on a monthly basis. We'll start to see that decline as we get better and better at monitoring the quality of those leads.
Therefore, putting less what we've referred to as hot transfers in the hands of enrollment counselors, but increasing the conversion of those hot transfers so they have a less kind of complicated job, and we can spend more time with the students who are really best equipped and prepared to do our programs.
Jeffrey Silber

Your next question comes from Mark Hughes with SunTrust.
Mark Hughes
- SunTrust  Analyst
Thank you very much. Using the modified, I guess, the restatement of the student population, what was the year-over-year increase in the August quarter?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
4.1%.
Mark Hughes
- SunTrust  Analyst
Okay. And then is the principle change there to adjust for students taking a single course, is that the way you described it?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Yes.
Mark Hughes
- SunTrust  Analyst
And then how do you make that determination, make the distinction between somebody who might just take a course. that's all they ever intended to take, versus somebody who might drop out after taking a course?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
In our system we identify degree students. Degree students have to do a number of things that non-degree students do not have to do.
It gets a little bit blurry because a lot of times what will happen is students will take a single course with us and decide they really like the program and transition during that very quarter into a degree program. I think that's part of why the number didn't come out right when we ran it during the fourth quarter. Some of those non-degree students, single course  they're students with us, but they're not in a degree program, popped up into that number.
We fixed that and had obviously has no impact on either revenue or earnings and so we believe that we have fixed that going forward now.
Mark Hughes
- SunTrust  Analyst
And then you had commented on the revenue trends in 2Q. What's your anticipation in terms of enrollment trends? Looks like you had nice acceleration this quarter. Should we anticipate more in Q2?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
We're not giving guidance, but we are happy with what's going on with regards to lead generation. Our conversion rates are going up slightly. We hope to improve from that standpoint.
We still have a big area of improvement that we need to make in terms of our ground-based counselors producing show rates as they put students into the online program at higher rates. It's just an educational process that we're going through.
The increased flexibility that those ground-based counselors have because they can offer students the ability to go into out ground-based program, our online program or our Axia program, we think really makes their job a higher potential job. But by the same token there is a transition that has to take place there because you've got to work hard at preparing students who are going into an online program for the first time, to ensure that they know what they're doing, that they're well prepared and that they're confident as they move into that first course.

Your next question comes from Steven Barlow with Prudential Equity Group.
Steven Barlow
- Prudential Equity Group, LLC  Analyst
Thank you. Last time you talked about some of the Axia graduation rates, I think it was 32% on that first class that you could monitor. If you'll update us on what that number looks like now and also what percent then would transfer up to level 3 at UOP.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
The numbers haven't changed that much, but it's been a very short period of time. I don't want to leave the wrong impression. What we did in terms of preparing that program and making it available to students who were coming to us with less college experience is, I believe we did a really good job in our first go at that.
One of the things that I think I mentioned last time, was that one of the things that we are finding is that when you put students into a program that is more directly related, especially in income, a new student to higher-ed, when you put them into a program that they are currently working in or aspire to work in, more of a niche program, the retention rate of those students is much higher than if you just put them in a general business program.
When we first started Axia College, we were putting almost all students just into a general business program. One of our strategies is to build out the number of programs that we have into areas that are more specific to a career. Our retention rates for example in the criminal justice program and the healthcare program and the IT programs are higher than they are in the general business program.
And so in order to increase the success rate of students we're continuing to work at how we build the curriculum, what kind of support systems we provide them, what library resources we continue to supply them, what tutorial resources we supply to them. But also, continuing to expand in job and career areas that are directly related to where people are either working or aspire to work, because that has a positive impact on their level of motivation and willingness to persist through to graduation.
Steven Barlow
- Prudential Equity Group, LLC  Analyst
That's fair.
And then last time you mentioned the Axia average student I guess was 30 years old, UOP, 33. Based on your insight acquisition, putting more emphasis on counselors going to high school, is there a particular goal you would like to see over the next couple years to get that Axia student average age down to 25, 26 to capture these kids a little earlier in their life cycle?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
The trend of higher percentage of students coming to us with very little college experience that's been growing over the last five or six years. The real purpose, the first purpose of Axia College was not to recruit high school students and put them into our program. It was just to provide an opportunity for those students that were coming to us anyway to have a more positive experience, achieve higher levels of success and graduation and we think we're moving in the right direction from that standpoint.
Now, over the course of time, and we're doing it gradually, we will position Axia College as an option for students graduating from high school. And it's not going to be a program that is designed for all high school students, obviously.
But we do believe that there is a niche of students there that want to stay home, want to stay in their local environments, aren't interested in taking six credit hours a semester and working and taking five or six years to complete their associates degree with two or three or four nights of attendance per week. But they would love an opportunity to get into a program that allows them to work and go to school at the same time, gives them a lot of flexibility in terms of their changing work hours and allows them to complete an associate's degree in a completely online environment in a period of 20 to 22 months.
But we'll work with high school guidance counselors and we'll work on promotional materials that position that program we believe in a way that will identify the right kinds of students who can benefit from it. And we're not anxious to be real aggressive there. We'll move fairly methodically with regards to that.

Your next question comes from Amy Junker with Robert Baird.
Amy Junker
- Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc.  Analyst
Good morning. I wanted to ask a couple of follow up questions on the Insight acquisition. With just 650 students at this point, is that school profitable at current levels?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Yes, when we've been through that first cycle and we open up the new schools, it will be  let me answer that differently. When we're up and running fully, that program, Insight Schools, will be a model whose profitability will be very similar to the University of Phoenix model.
Amy Junker
- Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc.  Analyst
Okay. So it's not currently but it should be?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Yes. Exactly how long that's going to take I can't tell you for sure. But a couple things, number one, there is very little expenditures with regards to physical brick and mortar classrooms. The program is going to be delivered in a completely online environment.
There is not nearly the advertising expense associated with recruiting the student through the University of Phoenix. There is a very high demand currently in the country for programs like this.
The fact that we are able to overlay our online learning system, our 24/7 technical support, our curriculum building capability, certain things in terms of overlaying all those things on what they currently have, we believe will accelerate the point at which it becomes profitable to the level of the University of Phoenix student. I'm not prepared to say right now exactly when that's going to be.
Amy Junker
- Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc.  Analyst
Okay. And we know from speaking with other providers of online K through 12 education that a lot of time and attention is spent on the lobbying to the states in order to get the schools opened. What investments do you need to make there in the short term to kind of reach your goal of opening in four states per year?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Well, it's mainly actually human resource investments and we believe we've got the best team that exists in the country to do that. Keith Oelrich who is the CEO of Insight Schools was formerly CEO of Apex. He was also formerly CEO of Keystone Schools. So he's got a really long experienced record of involvement in high school. We are not moving into K-8 at all at this point. Our focus is on high school, teaching high school students, and so there is a little bit of an investment there, but we think we've got the best team in the country to do it.
Amy Junker
- Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc.  Analyst
Last question from me, and then I'll turn it over. But I guess I'm curious if these students at the charter schools are really kind of your target students for Axia. My impression has been that a lot of these students are maybe accelerated students that are doing the online program and would they really be looking towards Axia once they finish.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Well, first point is whether they are or aren't it's going to be a profitable model in and of itself. Now, some of the students will be potentially Axia College students and some won't. The thing that's interesting about that model is that the students really cover a very, very broad spectrum. There are very bright students, very experienced students who do want an accelerated model.
They want to get out of high school in 2.5 or 3 years, they want to be in a challenging environment. They want to be well-prepared to do well on the college board exams. And there are also students who are in performance areas, sports, music, theater, etc., who have a heavy travel schedule and so they want to access this kind of a program. There are students who have problems adjusting from a social standpoint. There are students who have problems adjusting from a learning standpoint. And so it really covers a very, very wide spectrum.
The thing that excited us about Insight Schools over others is that they're very, very intelligent from the standpoint of their teaching, learning methodologies. They actually have six different tracks that they can put students into, depending upon where the student is in terms of their development and what their goals are. And so it's not a one size fits all at all with regards to how they address the needs of students.

Your next question comes from Kelly Flynn with UBS.
Kelly Flynn
- UBS  Analyst
Thanks. Couple questions. Can you tell us what the non-tuition revenue was in the fourth quarter versus tuition? Because I think you gave the just the tuition revenue for Q1. Can you give us the comparison and then also just talk about what is in that non-tuition revenue now and is that changing generally as a percentage of sales?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Non-tuition revenue is primarily resource fees that students are paying, we don't deal in the textbook world at all now for the most part. All of our student materials are prepared electronically and delivered through our online learning systems whether you're involved on ground or online and so anything that's non-tuition revenue primarily is the result of both application fees and resource fees.
Kelly Flynn
- UBS  Analyst
Okay. And can you tell us what it was as a percentage of revenue in Q4 and Q1?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
I don't have that in front of me. Okay. It went up slightly as a percent of overall revenue from fourth quarter to the first quarter.
Kelly Flynn
- UBS  Analyst
Okay. I was just wondering if the revenue per student which was higher on an absolute basis partly because of the enrollment restatement but is that line item influencing that significantly or not.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Not really, no.
Kelly Flynn
- UBS  Analyst
Okay. A second question unrelated, on the Department of Education, can you just confirm that what you put in the press release about the lender refund reimbursements is the same issue that you highlighted previously and just generally give an update on what's going on with the Department of Education and how comfortable are you that you're not going to get more detailed requests from them in the near future?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
No, it's the same issue. And it's an ongoing process that we're going through. We don't have anything really further to report at this time. If we did have something that was material we would certainly report it to you as soon as we had it and knew that it was material. So we really don't want to comment further on that. But it is the same issue. It's an ongoing process and you know, the Department of Education is and our involvement from a Title IV standpoint is something that we'll continue to work at and will always be something that will be really foremost from the standpoint of our attention and our focus. But it's the same issue.
Kelly Flynn
- UBS  Analyst
Okay. And then one last one on discounts. I know you mentioned most of the discounts were in military. I had heard anecdotally that you are offering a $2,000 scholarship to anyone who enrolls, who graduates from Axia and then enrolls at UOP within the next 60 days. Can you confirm whether or not that's happening and if so is it just military?

Your next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Lehman Brothers.
Gary Bisbee
- Lehman Brothers  Analyst
Couple questions, if I could. You talked about some of the things that you think over time are going to allow Axia to see improving graduation rates and then maybe potentially the enrollment rate up into University of Phoenix but what a lot of it sounds like sort of longer term stuff. Is there any reason to be optimistic that those metrics you gave us last quarter could improve somewhat over, say, the next 12 months or is this really much more a couple of year process?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
I think it's something that we are going to work at very hard. We're going to work at it as an ongoing process. We're going to work at it very methodically. One of the things that we have done over the years, but are really going to commit to on a very serious way, even more serious way in the future, is doing a lot of research into that online learning environment.
We have a tremendous resource there. We've got an archive of every single online course that we've ever taught. Our ability to set up research designs and really evaluate what adds value to the student, what causes them to learn at higher rates and to succeed at higher rates and to persist both in terms of instructional strategies, curriculum, support services, etc., are things that we think we are in a position to take a leadership role in and so we're not going to do anything from a knee-jerk reaction standpoint.
This is very much a long-term thing and we want to very methodically understand what we're doing better and over time keep getting better at that. I'll restate what I said earlier. There is a larger percentage of high school students, high school graduates now whether they come directly out of high school or at a later time that are finding that they need to go to college. The ticket to the middle class is not through the manufacturing world the way it was.
This is a growing and burgeoning group of students that are requesting access to higher education. The fact that they can't be successful, some of them, can't be successful in a traditional environment doesn't mean they can't be successful. If you put one of those students in a large lecture hall of 400 students, the chances are very minimal.
You put them in a very highly supported online learning environment and we think we can be successful and over time we would like to nudge that 32% closer to 50%. But again, it's over time.
Gary Bisbee
- Lehman Brothers  Analyst
Okay. And given that it sounds like you've had real good performance with the starts growth based on the higher spend and some of the things you've been doing, I guess I'm trying to understand how rapidly the total enrollment growth rate would be likely to accelerate if the majority of growth is coming from Axia and the Axia kid drops out at a lot higher rate than the University of Phoenix. And I guess any comment on that.
And the second part of that is that I think you made the comment that substantially more than 50% of leads are now interested in Axia. It seems to me that that could make this worse. In other words, if the mix shift continues to head towards 50/50, but these kids drop out more frequently, you're going to need substantially more starts just to tread water, let alone accelerate your growth.
I guess is that a reasonable way to think about it or any comments you have on that would be helpful.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Yes. No, it's not. Because the issue, if you talk to anybody who has been a director of one of our campuses, what they'll tell you is that over the last five years, five to six years, as we have gotten bigger, both nationally and in individual markets, a higher percentage of students coming to us were people that had less experience from a college perspective.
When we were putting those students into the University of Phoenix program, which is a very accelerated program, and we put them in at the University of Phoenix tuition rate, our success rate with those students was very, very low. The real hard churn from a marketing and sales standpoint took place two, three, four years ago as compared to today. 32% doesn't sound like it's extremely good.
But it is very much ahead of the 7% rate that we were experiencing when we put them in the UOP program and it's significantly ahead of the rates that community colleges are experiencing and we've heard various reports, 16% from the latest one. And so I think to put today's world from the standpoint of what contribution new starts will have to total enrollment, if you compare it to the most difficult period we were in, that was really two, three, four years ago, when that churn was even greater than it is today.
So total enrollment growth is not nearly challenged as much by the Axia phenomenon, as it is challenged by the just large numbers challenge.
Gary Bisbee
- Lehman Brothers  Analyst
Okay. And just following up on that one, I guess one more macro question, which is just if you look at the Bureau of Labor statistics data it will tell you somewhere around a third of people 25 or older in the U.S. have a bachelor degree.
But there's something like 80 million people who don't. I guess I'm trying to understand what has changed in terms of the demographics in the last two years that's made it so much more challenging to sign up your traditional type of student, 35 years old, might have a year or two but never completed the B.A., it would seem like the addressable market remains massive. Is it just a matter of competition of  you've now have campuses in most of the big cities so you've already saturated the real easy part of the market to get or what else is going on if it's not just the Axia phenomenon?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
It's large numbers. And it's competition. Which is why it's really, really important for us to continue to be extremely innovative in understanding the life situation that students are in and making sure that we're building programs and curriculum and instructional strategies that are convenient and flexible and really address directly their career goals.
And we're spending a lot of time at making sure that we continue to get better at that and making sure that we stay ahead of where everybody else is.
Gary Bisbee
- Lehman Brothers  Analyst
Okay. Great. That's helpful. If I could just sneak in one financial question. Can you help me understand why the receivables, the increase that hurt cash flow was so large when the receivables on the balance sheet fell quarter over quarter?
I understand a portion of that was you wrote up the bad debt reserve. But the two things and the fact that that didn't flow through the P&L, that $34 million have me a little confused. Is there something else going on with the cash flow, or was that more of a timing issue that might normalize down as we look forward the next quarter or two.
Joseph D'Amico
- Apollo Group, Inc.  CFO
This is Joe D'Amico. I think the issue here is DSO has grown by four days. So we're up to 36 days in DSO. We're working at that.
So I think that's the one issue and then make sure you're looking at the reserve because we've added $34 million to the balance sheet that you see to the reserves. So that's reduced the receivables from the prior year.
Gary Bisbee
- Lehman Brothers  Analyst
So is there anything going on in terms of how the students are funding this? Are you giving more credit? Or is it just a matter that the people on the campuses and online are focused on things other than collections right now?
Joseph D'Amico
- Apollo Group, Inc.  CFO
Nothing that we know of.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
There's nothing changing with regards to how they're paying for it. The challenge is simply that as we grow the student body and as we grow our employee base, that we do those things on the front end that are required in a very expedient, very efficient way, so that we minimize the opportunity for students who may drop out to have  they don't have their financial aid in. So it really is an operational thing at the front end and it's one of the things that we have just have to work at and get better at.

Hi. Good morning.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Good morning.
Corey Greendale
- First Analysis Securities  Analyst
I just had a couple of follow-ups on previous questions. First, kind of detail on the question that Mark Hughes asked, I think you said it was 4.1% growth in August. I was wondering, just to put that in a broader context, if you happen to have the growth rates for each quarter of 06 to put that in kind of a broader context.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Yes. That was a good question and we intend to respond to that. I don't know if we'll do it in a press release. But we'll figure out some way to communicate that out in the next number of weeks.
Corey Greendale
- First Analysis Securities  Analyst
Okay. Thank you.
Second question is, it sounded, Brian, like it was a little bit of when you were talking about potential uses of cash like a little change in tone on the repurchases. I thought last quarter you said that you would likely get back in the market pretty aggressively after the option issue was resolved. Now it's sounding more kind of measured and you'll consider it and can you clarify if that was a change in tone and if it is, what the thought process is?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Just wanting to be very conservative in what we say at this particular time because we can't be active in the market. So it's just not really something we want to talk about until the back dating issue is behind us. We're current with our filings and then obviously we're looking at it, we're working at it. I just didn't think it was very helpful to spend a lot of time with that currently because it's not something we can do.
Corey Greendale
- First Analysis Securities  Analyst
Okay. Next question I had, do you have any thoughts on historically looking at the business it was hard to detect if there was any seasonality because it was growing so fast and with the change in the student mix and looking at some months slower enrollment growth rates.
Do you have any thoughts on whether it looks more like a lot of other post secondary businesses where kind of you have higher enrollment in the fall than in the summer or what the seasonality ends up looking like as you go forward?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
I don't think it's going to change a lot. I mean, we work as hard as we possibly can to even it out. We work as hard as we possibly can in terms of when we place our advertising, how we place it and how we work with our enrollment counselors, our sales team to make sure of that. We are evening that process out. The biggest times  it doesn't have nearly as much to do with new student recruitment as it has to do with the persistence level of students. By that I don't mean their retention rate.
In other words, students who have dropped out and are not coming back but the times that when you get very large like that you really have to be careful about and work hard on, is keeping students persistently enrolled both through the holiday season and through the summer months. And that's always a little bit of an issue. But it just becomes a little bit more of an issue the bigger that we become.
And we just have to, from a strategic standpoint, working with our staff and providing students reasons to stay in through those periods and we're working at that.
Corey Greendale
- First Analysis Securities  Analyst
Okay. On another topic, the false claims  the Supreme Court. Can you just quickly talk through if the Supreme Court chooses not to hear the case what the next steps would be and what the timing would be?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Not really at this point because it's something that is from a strategic standpoint, it's something that we're keeping internal. We're waiting to find out what the Supreme Court response is and at the point we know that we'll do what we think is best from that standpoint. So we're not really prepared to discuss that in detail today.

And last real quick one. Thanks for taking the time. Do you happen to know, the year ago press release, the November quarter last year, when you gave the percent of degree tuition that was coming from the University of Phoenix, do you happen to know if that included Axia or not?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Well, yes, it's complicated because when we first started Axia College, we didn't know for sure what the response would be and so we initially had put that college in Western international university. At the point we saw that this was  that this was going to be a very productive part of our strategy in the future, we went through the North Central, the Higher Learning Commission process and we moved that college out of Western International University into the University of Phoenix. However, we gave students the choice to stay in Western International University and get their associate's degree from there if they wanted to. So what you're seeing now is over a period of time, students migrating from WIU to University of Phoenix and also as we put in new students, they're all going into the Axia College of University of Phoenix, and so what you're seeing in terms of University of Phoenix revenue as a percent of all revenue going back up to what its historical levels have been.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Trace Urdan with Signal Hill Capital.
Trace Urdan
- Signal Hill Capital  Analyst
Good morning. Thanks for taking my call.
I hate to take you back here, Brian, but I just want to ask one more question about the restated enrollments because I think I understand the explanation and yet when I look at the prior year press release, you offer a breakdown by type of program and it seems as though the numbers have been adjusted downward along each of those lines. In other words, associates, bachelors, masters and doctorates students are all adjusted downward. I'm having a hard time understanding how that works, how you take single course enrollments and attribute them to specific degree programs.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Part of that is that we included the IPD and WIU numbers a year ago. And so those associate, baccalaureate and master's degree students that were in IPD, WIU or CFP would have been included in those numbers so that's part of the downward, and the reason that we haven't included them currently is that in order to make this as uniform as possible and in order for us to have as clear of information as possible for us internally and also externally, we've worked on the automated count process. We've got that in place now at the University of Phoenix. We feel very good about that.
We have not been able at this point to use our system to automate students at WIU, CFP and IPD and so at the point that we can automate and make that count exactly the same as we do at University of Phoenix, we'll include them. But at this point we haven't been able to do it.
Trace Urdan
- Signal Hill Capital  Analyst
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a crank here. When I'm looking at the press release it seems as though you do break away in the prior year those numbers by University of Phoenix and then versus consolidated. So it appears as though the numbers are adjusted downward even excluding WIU and IPD.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
I'll have to take a look at that. I don't have that information in front of me right now.
Trace Urdan
- Signal Hill Capital  Analyst
With respect to Insight, one of the things that I've heard from competitors that operate in the online high school market that is the completion rates there are poor.
There is a lot of demand, but the staying power of the students rarely last two years, I'm told at the high school level. And I'm wondering if you've accounted for that as you were sort of looking at what the model there is or whether you're making any kind of assumptions about your ability to keep those kids in school similar to the way that you're able to keep the kids or the young people in school at Axia?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
No, our belief is just the opposite. And it's a result of the evidence that Keith and his group have learned over the course of seven years they've been in the business.
The business model that we built had retention rates of students near 80%, and in fact as we finished the first semester with the first 650 students they were right at just under 80% in terms of their retention rates. So it's very much the opposite of what you've heard from other competitors.
Trace Urdan
- Signal Hill Capital  Analyst
Well, then, you just attribute that to the school's methodologies.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
I don't know a lot about who you're talking about or what their methodologies are. I'm not sure. I'm only responding to the Insight School team and that methodology.
Trace Urdan
- Signal Hill Capital  Analyst
Okay. Fair enough. And then last question, I wondered if you could tell us if University of Phoenix is one of the 60 schools that the Attorney General in New York state has requested information from with respect to their participation with lenders and what the relationship is with lenders.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
No, I can't comment on that. I just don't know.
Trace Urdan
- Signal Hill Capital  Analyst
Okay. All right.

Your next question comes from Jennifer Childe with Bear, Stearns.
Jennifer Childe
- Bear, Stearns & Co.  Analyst
Thanks a lot. Brian, I was hoping you could tell us why the cost of educational services growth continues to exceed revenue growth by such a large margin. I can see the individual line item increases. But I'm just wondering why there's a 90% increase in employee compensation and can you help us with that?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Yes, the instructional costs, there are really three categories there. One is bad debt expense and that has contributed to that. As we hire enrollment counselors, and those people are in the sales and promotion category, we also hired the equivalent number of financial and academic counselors which you have to do in our model, our business model.
And so just like we were catching up from the standpoint of the productivity of those enrollment counselors, we're catching up with the productivity of those academic and financial advisors. The other part of that instructional cost that went up is simply the instructional cost in terms of instructors and that's going to go up as a percent of revenue as you teach more groups, you're going to have more instructors. So that will go up as a percent of revenue.That will stay equivalent as a percent of revenue. The part that caused it to go up was the academic and financial advisors that we hired that needed to be in position, because we hired the enrollment counselors. That will even out over time as those enrollment counselors become increasingly productive.
Jennifer Childe
- Bear, Stearns & Co.  Analyst
Okay. Well even without the bad debt it was still up 13%. So you think over the balance of this year we might see some moderation?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Yes, the advertising went from 11% down to 9.8%. Enrollment counselor salaries in this period went from 11.3% down to 9% [CLARIFICATION: Yes, the advertising went from 11% in Q4 06 down to 9.8% in Q1 07. Enrollment counselor salaries in this period were 11.3%, up from 9% in Q1 06]. And so we're moving in the right direction. It's just going to take us a number of quarters to get back to 29% or 30%.
Jennifer Childe
- Bear, Stearns & Co.  Analyst
What about new campus plans this year and your capital expenditure expectations?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
I'm sorry. Repeat that again.
Jennifer Childe
- Bear, Stearns & Co.  Analyst
New campuses this year and Cap-ex budget.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
We have a number of small campuses that we are going to open, but we're going to open them as online store fronts, meaning we're not going to open them from the standpoint of classrooms, and so they shouldn't have the negative impact on earnings that new campus openings have had in the past. From a cap-ex standpoint, there was an increase there as a result of the new building that we're putting up, but we're in the process, over the course of quarters, that will get reversed.
Because we're paying for the building, but we are selling it around we're going to lease that space back, and so that increase in cap-ex was primarily the result of that new building. That will be reversed over the number of quarters as we sell that building and take on the lease payments.
Jennifer Childe
- Bear, Stearns & Co.  Analyst
Okay. Similar in line with last year's level off?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Yes.
Jennifer Childe
- Bear, Stearns & Co.  Analyst
Okay. Thank you.
Joseph D'Amico
- Apollo Group, Inc.  CFO
Maybe just one clarification on some of the expense numbers that Brian was going through. I think may have referred to percentages that were actually the reverse.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Well, what I was referring to was percentages fourth quarter versus first quarter, rather than first quarter versus first quarter.
Jennifer Childe
- Bear, Stearns & Co.  Analyst
Is there any seasonality at work there also?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
A little bit. A little bit. Because your revenues are going to be higher in the first quarter and the third quarter.
Jennifer Childe
- Bear, Stearns & Co.  Analyst
Okay.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
So, there's a little bit of that at work. But the 400 basis points that we gained most of that is as the result of higher student enrollment, increased revenues and then as a percent of revenues, some of those items going down.
Jennifer Childe
- Bear, Stearns & Co.  Analyst
Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Ron McConey with ThinkEquity.
Ron McConey
- ThinkEquity Partners  Analyst
Hi. Thanks. Brian, are you willing to give us an estimate for the single course enrollments in Q1 07.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Not at this point. It's a growing business and we feel very good about it. At some point we may decide to break that out so it can become clearer to you. But we're just not ready to do it right now.
Ron McConey
- ThinkEquity Partners  Analyst
So does that mean the single course enrollments grew from Q4 06 levels of about it looks like 11,000 enrollments?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
You really can't say enrollments because they take one course at a time. Sometimes they'll take two or three courses. But they're not degree students. And so, reporting that out at this time is probably just going to cause more confusion than it's going to be helpful.
Ron McConey
- ThinkEquity Partners  Analyst
Okay. Thanks. And also how about an update on the show rate, I think it was around 60% last quarter.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
It was between 55% and 60%. We nudged that up 2% points. And very honestly, we're not where we'd like to be there.
We just need to  we know that we can get it close to 80% because we've been recruiting students into an online environment for basically since 1989. So we know we can get there. We just need to accelerate that process a little bit and get there. We need to move that along a little bit faster than it is.
Ron McConey
- ThinkEquity Partners  Analyst
Okay. Great. Thanks.

Your next question comes from Tom Lamb with Weybosset Research.
Tom Lamb
Analyst
Good morning. One moment, please. Hello, just wanted to ask about how the advertising environment was going, your efforts online and how advertising breaks out now between television online, billboards, that kind of thing and where you think you're having the most success.
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
We're not doing a lot from an outdoor standpoint from a billboard standpoint, but we are investing and you probably have seen in national television. That's mainly a branding kind of an exercise. We're spending less than 10% of our entire monthly budget on national television from a branding perspective.
Fortunately, we've been able to put back in as part of our marketing budget without increasing the percent of advertising as a percent of revenue because we have experienced an increasing decline in what we're having to pay for leads. And so we feel very good about the direction all of that is going.
Tom Lamb
Analyst
Are the leads primarily coming from your online advertising?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
Yes, leads, yes, there is a little bit of activity from the standpoint of response to the national television campaign, but as you probably observed, that's not a direct response spot. It's very much a branding and image spot and we hope that over time it has a positive impact on the image that people have at the University of Phoenix so indirectly causing our conversion rates of the online lead generating strategies to go up.
Tom Lamb
Analyst
I guess the reason for my question is that it seemed like a few years ago among other problems that your industry was having was this switch to online advertising which just causing problems right and left. Do you feel like you have that under control, it's going the direction you want to go?
Brian Mueller
- Apollo Group, Inc.  President
It became a challenge but it also you have to remember that if you think back to 1997 and 98 when we had 3,500 online students we grew from 3,500 to over 160,000 in a five or six year time frame there.
Part of it was we were a first mover from an online standpoint, but a big part of it was the fact that we were a first mover from an online advertising perspective. So online advertising is right in our sweet spot. It's very important and we'd never did what we did from the standpoint of that growth at online and then producing the $500 million in free cash flow annually without online advertising. The problem was that the thing moved too heavily in a direction of favorable to the advertisers and unfavorable to those purchasing the advertising.
And that's the part of it that we worked hard at in the last year and a half to turn around. And fortunately we're a very large player and we have a lot of leverage and we are turning that around. The people who are good and work with us very carefully are getting more business, the people that aren't are getting less business. But we've made a lot of progress but there's still room to go there.

As expected, the Company was unable to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the second fiscal quarter ended February 28, 2007 by the required filing date of April 9, 2007, because it has not yet completed the restatement of its financial statements following receipt by the Companys Board of Directors (the "Board"), on December 8, 2006, of the Special Committees final factual findings of its stock option investigation. The Company, as a result, received a Nasdaq Staff Determination notice, dated April 11, 2007, indicating that the Company is not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14). The notice, which the Company expected, was issued in accordance with standard Nasdaq procedures. As previously disclosed, the Company is diligently working on the restatement of its financial statements and currently intends to file its delinquent reports by April 30, 2007. As previously reported, the Nasdaq Listing and Hearings Council ("Listing Council") confirmed its prior decision and determined to exercise its discretionary authority, under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4802(b), to grant the Company an exception to demonstrate compliance with all of the Nasdaqs continued listing requirements until May 25, 2007. Thus, the Companys securities will continue to be listed during this period. The Company expects it will be in compliance with all of Nasdaqs continued listing requirements before May 25, 2007; however, if by the close of business on that date the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14), the Companys securities will be suspended at the opening of business on May 29, 2007. A copy of the press release announcing the Companys receipt of the Nasdaq Staff Determination notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
As previously discussed in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 15, 2006, the Company concluded based on a review of its actual write-off experience from fiscal years 2000-2006 relating to accounts receivable, its allowance for doubtful accounts was understated at August 31, 2006. The Company has completed its analysis and expects at this time to record a pre-tax, non-cash increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts and the associated bad-debt expense of approximately $38 million. The Company also concluded that, of this amount, $24 million relates to years prior to 2006, which will be reflected in its restatement. The information in this Form 8-K shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of any gene ral incorporation language in such filing.

Table of Contents
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Table of Contents

 
Exhibit 99.1
     Phoenix, Arizona, May 21, 2007  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOL) ("Apollo Group" or the "Company") today reported fiscal 2007 financial results for its second quarter ended February 28, 2007. In addition, the Company announced that it will be filing later today with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2006, as well as its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended May 31, 2006, November 30, 2006 and February 28, 2007. With these filings, the Company will be current with the SEC on all required and delinquent periodic filings.
     These filings contain financial statements that were restated as a result of Apollo Group's investigation into its past stock option practices, as well as other items. On June 23, 2006, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a Special Committee to retain independent legal counsel, who in turn retained forensic accountants, to assist them in conducting an independent review of the Company's historical practices related to stock option grants. On December 16, 2006, the Special Committee's final factual findings were announced in a press release. In November 2006, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, the Company began its own in-depth internal review to ascertain the most likely measurement date of every stock option grant since its initial public offering ("IPO"). As a result of the restatement, for the fiscal years 1994 through 2005, the Company has recorded pre-tax non-cash compensation expense of $52.9 million.
     As previously announced, the Company's continued listing on Nasdaq is subject to review by the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council. The Company believes, based upon the filings that will be made later today with the SEC and additional information previously submitted to the Listing Council, that it will regain compliance with the requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq.
     "From a governance standpoint, Apollo is now a much stronger company, and we are confident in our procedures going forward," said Brian Mueller, president of Apollo Group, Inc. "We have significantly strengthened the governance and internal controls of the Company, including the implementation of a new process for granting stock options, the addition of two new independent members of the Board of Directors, a new Chairperson of the Audit Committee, and a new Compensation Committee. With the investigation and restatement behind us, our energies are solely focused on creating long-term shareholder value."
     Based on the independent review conducted by the Special Committee as well as Apollo Group's internal review, the Company determined that 57 of the 100 total grants made during the period from 1994 through September 2006 used incorrect measurement dates for accounting purposes. The Special Committee also found no direct evidence that the grant date for any of the large management grants was selected with the benefit of hindsight.
     The Company also identified four material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting, which it believes it has made significant progress in remediating as of February 28, 2007. The material weaknesses related to ineffective internal control over financial reporting include:
1
 
     The Company had four primary adjustments to its financial statements:
     The financial impact of the adjustments for fiscal 2006 and the first quarter of 2007 is summarized in the table below.
     
Second Quarter Fiscal 2007 Results of Operations
     Net income was $60.3 million, or $0.35 per diluted share (174.6 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to $79.1 million, or $0.45 per diluted share (175.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended February 28, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Before giving effect to share based compensation expense and other unusual pre-tax charges of $5.7 million and $26.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively, earnings per diluted share were $0.44 in the second quarter of 2007, as compared to $0.57 in the second quarter of 2006. (See the reconciliation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
     Consolidated revenues for the three months ended February 28, 2007, totaled $608.7 million, which represents a 6.7% increase over the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Total degreed enrollments grew by 10.2%. The University of Phoenix, Inc. ("UPX") accounted for 92.9% of total tuition and other revenues, net.
2
 
     Commenting on the quarter, Mueller said, "We are pleased with the progress we have made in enrollment growth which is driven by productivity improvements in advertising, new enrollment hires, enhanced retention strategies and our branding campaign. New Degreed Enrollments, which we are reporting for the first time, increased 24% year-over-year. The increase in enrollment growth drove revenue growth as well, despite the continued impact of the mix shift to our lower priced Axia program, as well as additional holiday breaks in 2007 versus 2006. In May, we instituted a price increase at Axia which should further benefit revenue growth going forward."
     Mueller continued, "We have refined, with the support of our Board of Directors, a long-term strategic plan to best ensure the effective deployment of our resources and capital. Our goal over time is to generate mid-to-high single-digit annual domestic revenue growth and low double-digit annual operation income and free-cash flow growth."
     Instructional costs and services increased by $33.8 million to $296.4 million, a 12.9% increase, in the three months ended February 28, 2007, as compared to the three months ended February 28, 2006, primarily resulting from increases in employee-related expenses due to the higher enrollment numbers, and wage adjustments instituted in December 2005 that increased pay principally to entry-level employees.
     Selling and promotional expenses increased by $42.7 million to $166.9 million, a 34.4% increase, in the three months ended February 28, 2007, from the three months ended February 28, 2006, primarily resulting from increases in the number of enrollment counselors and an increase in advertising expenditures for both the Company's internet-based advertising campaign as well as the launch of a national televised branding campaign.
     General and administrative expenses decreased by $5.4 million to $53.6 million, a 9.2% decline, in the three months ended February 28, 2007, from the three months ended February 28, 2006. Before giving effect to stock option modifications of $12.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, as well as the unusual charges discussed above of $5.7 million and $26.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively, general and administrative expenses were $35.8 million and $33.0 million in the three months ended February 28, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which represents approximately 5.9% of revenues in both periods.
     
Six Months of Fiscal 2007 Results of Operations
     Net income attributed to Apollo Group common stock was $174.2 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, (174.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to $207.7 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, (178.1 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the six months ended February 28, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
     Total consolidated revenues for Apollo Group for the six months ended February 28, 2007 were $1.3 billion, a 6.4% increase over the six months of fiscal 2006. Average quarterly degree enrollments grew by 9.3%. UPX accounted for 91.9% of total tuition and other revenues, net.
     
Expanded Disclosure of Financial and Operating Metrics
     Apollo Group has expanded the financial data and operating metrics that it will be reporting on a quarterly basis, and has provided this historical information in the table below. The Company has broken out Degree Seeking Revenues, Single Course/Continuing Ed Revenues, and Other Revenues. Furthermore, the Company has provided Revenue by Degree Type, and New Degreed Enrollments.

     The Company will hold a conference call to discuss these earnings results as well as its long-term strategic plan at 8:30 AM Eastern, 5:30 AM Pacific, tomorrow, Tuesday, May 22, 2007.

EXHIBIT INDEX

 
     Phoenix, Arizona, June 28, 2007  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOL) ("Apollo Group" or the "Company") today reported fiscal 2007 financial results for the third quarter ended May 31, 2007. The Company also announced that its Board of Directors ("Board") authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of Apollo Group Class A common stock. Under the program the Company may repurchase shares from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Apollo Group management will determine the timing and number of shares repurchased.
            Net income was $131.4 million, or $0.75 per diluted share (174.6 million weighted average shares outstanding), compared to $131.5 million, or $0.75 per diluted share (174.5 million weighted average shares outstanding) for three months ended May 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Before giving effect to share based compensation expense and special items of $16.5 million in the third quarter of 2007 and $6.8 million in the third quarter of 2006, earnings per fully diluted share were $0.81 in the third quarter of 2007, as compared to $0.78 in the third quarter 2006. (See the reconciliation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Third Quarter Fiscal 2007 Results of Operations
     Consolidated revenues for the three months ended May 31, 2007, totaled $733.4 million, which represents a 12.2% increase over the third quarter of fiscal 2006. Total degreed enrollments grew by 12.2% year-over-year to 311,100.
     Commenting on the quarter, Brian Mueller, president of Apollo Group, Inc., said, "Our fiscal third quarter is showing promising signs that the investments we made over the last 18 months are paying off. We are very pleased with the improvement we are seeing in enrollment and revenue growth, as well as in our operating margin. The continued progress is driven by further productivity improvements from new enrollment hires, enhanced retention strategies, efficiencies in our advertising spend and our branding campaign. New Degreed Enrollments increased 21.2% year-over-year. We are proud to have achieved double-digit revenue growth due to our strong enrollments and continued improvement in retention. As a reminder, over the long-term, we remain committed to our goal of mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth and low double-digit annual operating income and free cash flow growth."
     Mueller continued, "Our liquidity and cash flow for the quarter were strong. As a result of this and other value considerations, we have increased the size of our existing share repurchase program to up to $500 million."
     Instructional costs and services increased 13.1% or $37.3 million to $321.0 million, in the three months ended May 31, 2007, as compared to the three months ended May 31, 2006, primarily resulting from increases in employee-related expenses due to the higher enrollment numbers as well as an increase in bad debt expense which, as discussed last quarter, is primarily the result of a shift in the Company's student mix. As a percentage
1
 
of revenue instructional costs and services were 43.8% versus 43.4% a year ago.
     Selling and promotional expenses increased by $24.7 million to $162.9 million, a 17.9% increase, in the three months ended May 31, 2007, from the three months ended May 31, 2006, primarily resulting from increases in the number of enrollment counselors and an increase in advertising expenditures for both the Company's internet-based advertising campaign as well as the launch of a national televised branding campaign. As a percentage of revenue, selling and promotional expenses were 22.2% versus 21.1% a year ago.
     General and administrative ("G&A") expenses increased by $15.7 million to $46.1 million, a 51.6% increase, in the three months ended May 31, 2007, from the three months ended May 31, 2006. As a percentage of revenues, G&A was 6.3% as compared to 4.7% in the prior year quarter. Before giving effect to special items primarily related to stock option investigation and restatement costs of $7.6 million, G&A expenses were $38.5 million in the three months ended May 31, 2007, or 5.2% of revenues.
            Apollo Group reported the following financial data and operating metrics for the three months ended May 31, 2007 and 2006.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e)
On June 27, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Apollo Group, Inc. (the "Company") authorized certain equity awards for the Company's executive officers to become effective on the third business day following the filing of the Company's 10-Q for the quarter ended May 31, 2007 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The authorized award for each executive officer is comprised of two components: a stock option grant to purchase shares of the Company's Class A common stock and a restricted stock unit award for additional shares of such Class A common stock. The awards will be made under the Company's 2000 Stock Incentive Plan.
The executive officers for whom such equity awards have been authorized and the number of shares of Class A common stock subject to their respective awards are as follows:
Except as noted below, each option will have an exercise price per share equal to the closing price per share of the Company's Class A common stock on the effective date and will have a maximum term of 6 years. The option will become exercisable for the option shares in four successive equal annual installments upon the executive officer's completion of each year of service with the Company over the four-year period measured from September 1, 2007, subject to accelerated vesting upon certain changes in control or ownership of the Company. However, the option grant to Mr. D'Amico will have a maximum term of 4 years and will become exercisable for the option shares in three successive
Table of Contents
equal annual installments upon his completion of each year of service with the Company over the three-year period measured from June 15, 2007, subject to accelerated vesting upon certain changes in control or ownership of the Company. The option grant to Peter Sperling will have a maximum term of 10 years and will become exercisable upon his continuation in service through August 31, 2007.
Except as noted below, each restricted stock unit award will be subject to both performance-vesting and service-vesting requirements, and none of the restricted stock units will vest unless the Company's net book income, after tax expense and exclusive of acquisition costs, is not less than a pre-established amount for the fiscal year beginning September 1, 2007. Should such performance objective be attained, then the restricted stock units will vest in four successive equal annual installments upon the executive officer's completion of each year of service with the Company over the four-year period measured from September 1, 2007, subject to accelerated vesting upon certain changes in control or ownership of the Company. For Mr. D'Amico, the service-vesting period will be limited to three years measured from June 15, 2007. The shares of Class A common stock subject to each restricted stock unit award will be issued as the award vests. Each restricted stock unit award also provides the executive officer with dividend equivalent rights with respect to the shares of Class A common stock subject to the award. However, the restricted stock units awarded to Peter Sperling are not subject to any performance vesting requirement and will vest if he continues in the Company's service until August 31, 2007.

(e)
On June 27, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Apollo Group, Inc. (the "Company") authorized certain equity awards for the Company's executive officers to become effective on the third business day following the filing of the Company's 10-Q for the quarter ended May 31, 2007 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The authorized award for each executive officer is comprised of two components: a stock option grant to purchase shares of the Company's Class A common stock and a restricted stock unit award for additional shares of such Class A common stock. The awards will be made under the Company's 2000 Stock Incentive Plan.
The executive officers for whom such equity awards have been authorized and the number of shares of Class A common stock subject to their respective awards are as follows:
Except as noted below, each option will have an exercise price per share equal to the closing price per share of the Company's Class A common stock on the effective date and will have a maximum term of 6 years. The option will become exercisable for the option shares in four successive equal annual installments upon the executive officer's completion of each year of service with the Company over the four-year period measured from September 1, 2007, subject to accelerated vesting upon certain changes in control or ownership of the Company. However, the option grant to Mr. D'Amico will have a maximum term of 4 years and will become exercisable for the option shares in three successive

equal annual installments upon his completion of each year of service with the Company over the three-year period measured from June 15, 2007, subject to accelerated vesting upon certain changes in control or ownership of the Company. The option grant to Peter Sperling will have a maximum term of 10 years and will become exercisable upon his continuation in service through August 31, 2007.
Except as noted below, each restricted stock unit award will be subject to both performance-vesting and service-vesting requirements, and none of the restricted stock units will vest unless the Company's net book income, after tax expense and exclusive of acquisition costs, is not less than a pre-established amount for the fiscal year beginning September 1, 2007. Should such performance objective be attained, then the restricted stock units will vest in four successive equal annual installments upon the executive officer's completion of each year of service with the Company over the four-year period measured from September 1, 2007, subject to accelerated vesting upon certain changes in control or ownership of the Company. For Mr. D'Amico, the service-vesting period will be limited to three years measured from June 15, 2007. The shares of Class A common stock subject to each restricted stock unit award will be issued as the award vests. Each restricted stock unit award also provides the executive officer with dividend equivalent rights with respect to the shares of Class A common stock subject to the award. However, the restricted stock units awarded to Peter Sperling are not subject to any performance vesting requirement and will vest if he continues in the Company's service until August 31, 2007.

Apollo Group, Inc. News Release
     Phoenix, Arizona, October 22, 2007  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOL) ("Apollo Group" or the "Company") today reported fiscal 2007 unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended August 31, 2007.
     
Unaudited Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2007 Results of Operations
     Net income for the three months ended August 31, 2007 was $103.2 million, or $0.60 per diluted share (171.3 million weighted average shares outstanding), compared to $75.7 million, or $0.43 per diluted share (174.5 million weighted average shares outstanding) for three months ended August 31, 2006. Before giving effect to share-based compensation expense and special items of $19.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 and $31.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, earnings per diluted share were $0.67 in the fourth quarter of 2007, as compared to $0.54 in the fourth quarter 2006. (See the reconciliation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.) During the 2007 fourth fiscal quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 7 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average purchase price of approximately $61 for a total expenditure of $438 million. The repurchases are part of the $500 million authorization for the Company's stock repurchase program approved by the Apollo Group board of directors in June 2007. On October 5, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized an increase of the share repurchase program to an aggregate of $500 million in share repurchases.
     Consolidated revenues for the three months ended August 31, 2007, totaled $713.9 million, which represents a 14.2% increase over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Total degreed enrollments grew by 11.1% year-over-year to 313,700.
     Commenting on fiscal 2007, Brian Mueller, president of Apollo Group, Inc., said, "This was a rewarding year for Apollo Group and its stakeholders. We began seeing the benefits of the significant investments we made over the last couple of years and are very pleased with the progress we made both in our operations as well as from a corporate perspective. During the fiscal year we strengthened our management team, particularly in the finance and legal areas, and added additional talent and expertise to our board of directors. We also fortified our financial controls and corporate governance, and as a result, Apollo Group is a stronger company today."
     Mr. Mueller continued, "We are pleased with our fourth quarter results as we again achieved double-digit revenue and enrollment growth, while continuing to produce significant cash flow and earnings growth. We have made productivity gains in our enrollment counselor effectiveness, advertising, student persistence, academic excellence and program expansion. As a result, we ended the fiscal year with approximately 313,700 students enrolled in our degree programs. During the fourth quarter alone we started a record 69,800 students."

     Mueller added, "We enter fiscal 2008 with positive momentum and will continue to execute against our strategic plan to best position Apollo Group for long-term sustainable growth."
     Instructional costs and services in the three months ended August 31, 2007, increased by $27.0 million to $327.2 million, a 9.0% increase, from $300.2 million in the three months ended August 31, 2006, primarily resulting from increases in employee-related expenses due to the higher enrollment numbers as well as an increase in bad debt expense. As a percentage of revenue instructional costs and services declined to 45.8% versus 48.0% a year ago.
     Selling and promotional expenses increased by $19.5 million to $173.8 million, a 12.6% increase in the three months ended August 31, 2007, from the three months ended August 31, 2006. During the fourth quarter, the Company experienced a slight decrease in its cost per New Degreed Enrollment (or Starts) which is calculated by dividing total selling and promotional expenses by the amount of new Starts for the quarter. This slight decrease is attributed to improved conversion rates and a lower advertising expense per Start, which was partially offset by higher enrollment counselor costs per Start.
     General and administrative ("G&A") expenses increased by $28.1 million to $62.3 million, an 82.2% increase, in the three months ended August 31, 2007, from the three months ended August 31, 2006. As a percentage of revenues, G&A was 8.7% as compared to 5.5% in the prior year quarter. Before giving effect to special items primarily related to the stock option investigation and restatement costs of $6.4 million in 2007 and $1.6 million in 2006, G&A expenses were $55.9 million in the three months ended August 31, 2007, or 7.8% of revenues, compared to $32.6 million in the three months ended August 31, 2006, or 5.2% of revenues. The remaining increase is primarily attributable to higher share-based compensation expense and increased employee headcount to support the Company's future growth.
     
Financial and Operating Metrics (unaudited)
     Apollo Group reported the following unaudited financial data and operating metrics on a quarterly basis for the last eight quarters.
     Included in the table below is a correction of Apollo Group's historical New Degreed Enrollments to adjust for errors and inconsistencies in the calculation with our previously reported definition, which has not changed. To reiterate and clarify, New Degreed Enrollments include any student who graduated from one degree program and started a new degree program (for example, a graduate of the Associates Degree program returns for a Bachelors Degree or a graduate of a Bachelors Degree program returns for a Masters Degree), as well as students who have been out of attendance for greater than 12 months and return to a program. Degreed Enrollments were not affected by this correction since a student completing one program and entering a new program is only counted as one enrollment (in the new program) and returning students out of attendance for greater than 12 months were already included in degreed enrollments.

Unaudited Fiscal 2007 Results of Operations
     Net income for the twelve months ended August 31, 2007 was $408.8 million, or $2.35 per diluted share, (173.6 million weighted average shares outstanding), compared to $414.8 million, or $2.35 per diluted share, (176.2 million weighted average shares outstanding) for the twelve months ended August 31, 2006. Before giving effect to share-based compensation expense and special items of $75.7 million in fiscal 2007 and $75.5 million in fiscal 2006, earnings per diluted share were $2.62 in fiscal 2007, as compared to $2.61 in fiscal 2006. (See the reconciliation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") financial

information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
     Consolidated revenues for Apollo Group for the twelve months ended August 31, 2007 were $2.7 billion, a 9.9% increase over the twelve months of fiscal 2006. Average quarterly degree enrollments grew by 10.5%.
     Instructional costs and services as a percentage of tuition and other net revenues increased in 2007 versus 2006 due primarily to an increase in bad debt expense and higher employee compensation and related expenses. Bad debt expense increased as a result of higher days sales outstanding ("DSOs"), longer receivable collection periods, and higher write-offs primarily from the Company's associate's degree program students. Employee compensation and related expenses increased primarily to support the 10.5% increase in average quarterly Degreed Enrollments.
     Selling and promotional expenses increased as a percentage of revenue in 2007 versus 2006 due primarily to an increase in the number of enrollment counselors to support leads for the Company's Internet advertising campaign. During 2007, the Company experienced a slight increase in its cost per New Degreed Enrollment (or Starts) which is calculated by dividing total selling and promotional expenses by the amount of new Starts for the year. The hiring of an additional 600 enrollment counselors in the fourth quarter of 2006 increased the Company's enrollment counselor compensation and related expenses. The productivity of these counselors improved during 2007, and as a result, the Company has experienced increased conversion rates. Also, in 2007 selling and promotional expenses increased as a result of the Company's continued investment in Internet-based advertising campaigns and the launch of a nationally televised branding campaign.
     General and administrative expenses increased by 31.7% in 2007 versus 2006. Excluding special items, primarily related to the stock option investigation and restatement costs, general and administrative expense was $167.7 million and $125.4 million in 2007 and 2006, or 6.2% and 5.1% of revenue, respectively. The remaining increase in 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily related to higher employee headcount to support the Company's growth and higher share-based compensation expense.
     
Unaudited Balance Sheet
     As of August 31, 2007, the Company's cash and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash, was $392.7 million as compared to $408.7 million as of August 31, 2006. DSOs increased from 31 days at August 31, 2006 to 38 days as of August 31, 2007. Deferred tuition revenue increased 22.7% to $167.3 million between August 31, 2007 and 2006.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On November 26, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Apollo Group, Inc, (the "Company") adopted the Executive Officer Performance Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan"). The Plan is designed to allow the Compensation Committee to structure incentive bonuses for one or more of the Companys executive officers so that those bonuses will qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. Bonuses which so qualify will not be subject to the $1 million limit imposed by Section 162(m) on the income tax deductibility of the compensation paid per executive officer subject to such limit. Bonus periods under the Incentive Plan may range from a minimum of six (6) months to a maximum of thirty-six (36) months, and the bonus payable for the applicable period will depend upon the levels at which the performance goals established for that period are attained. The maximum bonus payable per participant will depend upon the length of the bonu s period, with the maximum bonus payable under the Incentive Plan set at five (5) times the participants annual base salary for a bonus period of at least twenty-four (24) months. On November 26, 2007, the Compensation Committee implemented the initial incentive bonus program under the Incentive Plan and set the bonus period to coincide with the Companys 2008 fiscal year which began on September 1, 2007. The program provides for an annual target bonus for the following executive officers of the Company: Name/Title/Target Bonus John G. Sperling; Acting Executive Chairman of the Board; $850,000 Brian E. Mueller; President; $500,000 Joseph L. DAmico; Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer; $500,000 Gregory W. Cappelli; Executive VP, Global Strategy; $500,000 P. Robert Moya; Senior VP and General Counsel; $400,000 Terri C. Bishop; Senior VP and Chief Communications Officer; $175,000 The actual bonus which any such officer may earn will range fr om 0 to 200% of his or her annual target bonus. The actual percentage will be determined based on the Companys attainment of certain revenue and operating profit goals which the Compensation Committee has established for the 2008 fiscal year. Each performance goal will be equally weighted in determining the potential bonus amount, and the Compensation Committee has set three potential levels of attainment for each goal: threshold, target and maximum. The executive officer may earn 100% of his or her target bonus if both performance goals are attained at target level or 200% of the target bonus amount if both performance goals are attained at maximum level or above. The executive officer will be entitled to only 50% of his or her target bonus if both performance goals are attained at threshold level. Interpolation on a straight line basis will be applied to any performance goal attained at a point between two designated levels, provided there has been at least threshold level attainment of that go al. The Compensation Committee has also reserved the discretion to reduce the executive officers bonus by up to 20% under certain specified circumstances. Both the Incentive Plan and the bonus program established for the 2008 fiscal year under that plan are subject to approval of the holders of the Companys Class B common stock.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On January 4, 2008, Apollo Group, Inc. entered into a five-year $500 million credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and various lenders named therein. The Credit Agreement provides for a $500 million revolving credit commitment, which may be used (i) for revolving loans, (ii) for swingline advances, subject to a sublimit of $25 million, and (iii) to request the issuance of letters of credit on our behalf, subject to a sublimit of $200 million. We may, subject to customary conditions, increase the commitments by up to an additional $250 million, subject to, among other things, the receipt of commitments for the increased amounts. The Credit Agreement also provides for a multi-currency sublimit facility for borrowings in certain specified currencies up to $300 million. The facility is unsecured and guaranteed by our material domestic subsidiaries.
The revolving loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at rates that, at our option, can be either: (a) a base rate (the "ABR") equal to the higher of (i) the administrative agent's prime rate, and (ii) the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus 0.5%, or (b) reserve and cost adjusted LIBO rate plus an applicable rate specified in the Credit Agreement. The applicable rate ranges from 0.50% to 0.825% based primarily on our leverage ratio. All swingline loans bear interest at the ABR.

Exhibit 99.1
Phoenix, Arizona, January 8, 2008  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOL) ("Apollo Group" or "the Company") today reported unaudited financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2008, which ended November 30, 2007.
Net income for the three months ended November 30, 2007, was $139.9 million, or $0.83 per diluted share (169.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to $113.9 million, or $0.65 per diluted share (174.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended November 30, 2006. Before giving effect to share-based compensation expense of $14.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 and to share-based compensation expense and special items of $12.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, earnings per diluted share were $0.88 in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, as compared to $0.69 in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. (See the reconciliation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Unaudited First Quarter of Fiscal 2008 Results of Operations
Consolidated revenues for the three months ended November 30, 2007, totaled $780.7 million, which represents a 16.9% increase over the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Total Degreed Enrollment grew by 11.4% year-over-year to 325,000. Revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 also benefited from previously implemented selective tuition price increases based on geographic areas and programs.
Commenting on the quarter, Brian Mueller, President of Apollo Group, said, "We are pleased with our first quarter results as we achieved double-digit revenue and enrollment growth for the third consecutive quarter. Our investments in the business are proving very effective and we again improved operating efficiencies as compared to a year ago."
Mr. Mueller continued, "At the end of October we closed our acquisition of Aptimus, and our marketing teams have been working tirelessly over the past couple of months to transition our online marketing activities in-house. We are pleased to report that the transition is going smoothly. Over the next several months and quarters, we will be implementing innovative marketing plans to moreeffectively communicate with prospective students and other constituents online."

Mr. Mueller concluded, "The demographic and economic trends contributing to the rise of adult education over the past three decades continue, and the emerging global marketplace expands the opportunities even more. Apollo Global, our recently formed joint venture with the Carlyle Group, will enable us to leverage our significant academic and operational infrastructure related to higher education and we look forward to capitalizing on the opportunities that exist given the significant foreign demand for education. We are optimistic about the future for Apollo Group and the credit agreement announced today gives us further financial flexibility to execute on our strategy to generate long-term value for our shareholders."
Instructional costs and services increased by $38.5 million to $333.3 million, a 13.1% increase, for the three months ended November 30, 2007, from the three months ended November 30, 2006. As a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net, instructional costs and services declined to 42.7% versus 44.1% in the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of decreases as a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net, in employee compensation and related expenses and classroom lease expenses and depreciation. This decrease was partially offset by increases as a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net, in bad debt expense and financial aid processing costs.
Bad debt expense as a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net, increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 versus the first quarter of fiscal 2007 primarily due to the continuing trend of changes in the Company's enrollment mix to a higher percentage of associate's degree students. When the Company is required to collect outstanding balances directly from its students, students enrolled in the associate's degree programs generally have higher write-offs, based on the greater risk of default presented by the associate's degree program's demographics, versus students enrolled in other degree programs. Additionally, during the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company performed a review of the components of bad debt expense and identified certain items that should have been classified as discounts or refunds (reduction of tuition revenue) as opposed to bad debt expense. No reclassification was made for prior periods as the amounts were not material to prior period financial statements and had no effect on reported net income. Had the Company not changed the classification for these items in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the amounts reported for tuition and other revenue, net, and bad debt expense would have been $5.1 million higher, and bad debt expense as a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net, would have been 4.78% versus 4.15%. For the first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2007, the Company's reported bad debt expense as a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net, would have been lower by 59, 82, 65 and 87 basis points, respectively, as a result of this reclassification.
Selling and promotional expenses increased by $21.5 million to $176.9 million, a 13.8% increase, for the three months ended November 30, 2007, from the three months ended November 30, 2006. As a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net, selling and promotional expenses declined to 22.6% versus 23.3% in the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of a decrease as a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net, in Internet-based advertising costs, partially offset by an increase as a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net, in costs to support the Company's national branding campaign. The Company's reduced advertising costs
- 2 -
 
as a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net, are being primarily driven by more efficient and productive spending to acquire higher quality Internet-based leads. As previously disclosed, the Company launched its national branding campaign in January 2007 and continues to invest to support its image.
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses increased by $13.7 million to $51.3 million, a 36.4% increase, for the three months ended November 30, 2007, from the three months ended November 30, 2006. As a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net, G&A increased to 6.6% versus 5.6% in the prior year quarter. Before giving effect to special items primarily related to the stock option investigation and restatement costs of $2.0 million in first quarter of fiscal 2007, G&A expenses were $35.6 million for the three months ended November 30, 2006, or 5.3% of tuition and other revenue, net. The increase in G&A as a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net, for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 is primarily attributable to increases as a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net, in salary and related payroll costs due to higher employee headcount, share-based compensation expense and legal costs.

- 4 -
 
As of November 30, 2007, the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash, totaled $590.5 million as compared to $392.7 million as of August 31, 2007. At November 30, 2007, days sales outstanding ("DSO") remained consistent with the prior year at 35 days and declined from 38 days at August 31, 2007. The decrease in DSO since August 31, 2007, is primarily due to a reduction in the percentage of current (less than 90 days old) receivables as a result of improvements in the Company's front-end collection process. The reclassification of bad debt expense discussed above did not affect the Company's DSO. Deferred revenue at November 30, 2007, decreased slightly to $160.0 million from $167.3 million at August 31, 2007, and increased from $132.0 million at November 30, 2006. The increase from the prior year quarter is principally due to increased revenue.
Unaudited Balance Sheet

Apollo Group, Inc.
News Release
Phoenix, Arizona, January 16, 2008  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOL) is disappointed in the decision returned today by a Phoenix jury in a consolidated securities class action brought by the Policemen's Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago. The case, tried in federal district court in Arizona, was premised on Apollo's supposed failure to disclose unsubstantiated allegations from a preliminary government report.
"We disagree with the jury's verdict, both the finding and the amount of damages," said Wayne W. Smith of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP, counsel to Apollo. "The law does not require the disclosure of preliminary or unproven charges in a government investigation. In not disclosing the report at issue, Apollo acted in good faith and in the best interests of its students, alumni, employees and shareholders, who could have been unfairly harmed by a premature disclosure."
Importantly, the ultimate disclosure of the report's contents caused no statistically significant movement in Apollo's stock price. The plaintiff in the case did not suffer any damages; there simply was no loss associated with the initial report and its unsubstantiated allegations.
During trial, Apollo presented evidence demonstrating that the Company acted responsibly, consulted with professional advisors as appropriate, and at all times communicated truthfully to the market.
Apollo is evaluating options for appeal.
United States District Judge James A. Teilborg presided over the case. In addition to Mr. Smith, Apollo was represented by: Joseph P. Busch III and Jared M. Toffer of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP; and David R. Rosenbaum of Osborn Maledon, P.A.

Apollo Group, Inc.
News Release
Phoenix, Arizona, January 24, 2008  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOL) ("Apollo Group" or "the Company") today provided clarification on certain matters in regard to the verdict returned on January 16, 2008, by a Phoenix jury in a consolidated securities class action suit brought by the Policemen's Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago.
The case, tried in federal district court in Arizona, was premised on Apollo's supposed failure to disclose unsubstantiated allegations from a preliminary government report. The jury awarded damages of $5.55 for each share of common stock in the class suit. The Company intends to pursue any and all remedies that may be available to reverse or reduce this damage award, including, if necessary, appealing the judgment once that judgment is issued by the court. The class is defined as shareholders who purchased shares after February 27, 2004, and still owned the shares on September 14, 2004. The actual amount of damages payable cannot be determined until notices are published and shareholders present valid claims. This process will take several months to complete; thus the actual amount of damages is not yet known. Plaintiffs have estimated that there are approximately 30 to 50 million shares in the class. Based on the plaintiffs' estimate, the damages would range between $166.5 million and $277.5 million. The Company will undertake a process to estimate the total liability associated with this jury verdict and intends to record its best estimate of the potential loss, including estimate future legal and other costs, in its second quarter of fiscal 2008.
Liability in the case is joint and several, which means that each defendant, including the Company is liable for the entire amount of the judgment. As a result, Apollo Group will be responsible for posting any bond associated with its appeal and, if finally adjudicated, payment of the full amount of damages as ultimately determined. The Company does not expect to receive material amounts of insurance proceeds from its insurers to satisfy any amounts ultimately payable to the plaintiff class. In addition, although the insurers have made or are expected to make payments under the policy for defense costs, including legal fees, incurred of approximately $25 million, the insurers have not waived their rights to object to the coverage. Nonetheless, from a liquidity perspective, as of November 30, 2007, the Company had $590.5 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash, and continues to generate positive cash flow. The Company believes payment of any ultimate liability will not have a material adverse effect on its business or cash flows.
With respect to the Company's recently announced credit facility, entry of the judgment will preclude the Company from obtaining extensions of credit under such facility until the judgment is stayed or discharged. If the judgment is not stayed or discharged within 60 days, it will constitute an event of default under the credit facility which would allow the lenders thereunder to terminate such facility. The Company expects to cause the judgment to be stayed by filing any necessary bond in a timely manner. There have not been any extensions of credit under the arrangement.
During trial, Apollo Group presented evidence demonstrating that the Company acted responsibly, consulted with professional advisors as appropriate, and at all times communicated truthfully to the market. The Company believes the jury's verdict in this case is not supported by the facts or the law, and, as stated above, intends to pursue its available remedies vigorously, including various motions for post-trial relief and an appeal. Currently, the Company is awaiting the court's formal judgment. After the judgment is entered, the Company will file post-trial motions and, if necessary, a notice of appeal.
The Company does not intend to disclose additional information about the litigation at this time and, therefore, will not be taking media calls.
Apollo Group, Inc. has been an education provider for more than 30 years, providing academic access and opportunity to students through its University of Phoenix, Institute for Professional Development, College for Financial Planning, Western International University, Insight Schools and Apollo Global.

News Release
Apollo Group enters Chilean post-secondary education market
Phoenix, Arizona, February 20, 2008  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOL) ("Apollo Group" or "the Company") today announced that its consolidated subsidiary, Apollo Global, Inc., has agreed to acquire Universidad de Artes, Ciencias y Comunicacin ("UNIACC"), an accredited, private arts and communications university in Chile, as well as its related entities. This includes the Instituto Superior de Artes y Ciencias de la Comunicacin, S.A. ("IACC"), the first online autonomous professional institute in the country which was founded in 1981. UNIACC, founded in 1989 and based in Santiago, Chile, has over 3,000 students and three campuses. Apollo Global, Inc. has agreed to purchase 100% of UNIAAC for $40 million composed of cash and assumed debt, plus an earn-out based on a multiple of earnings to be paid in four years. If the earn-out were paid based on current earnings it would be approximately $9 million. The acquisition, which represents the first transaction for Apollo Global, is expected to close within 30 days, subject to customary closing conditions.
"UNIACC's rigorous academic quality, premier brand and strong management team make it a logical partner for Apollo Group in our efforts to expand internationally," stated Greg Cappelli, Chairman of Apollo Global.  "We have been working diligently to identify opportunities that will create value for Apollo Group shareholders, and we believe UNIACC, coupled with Chile's stable economic environment, strong student enrollment trends, and openness to foreign investment, is an excellent fit."
Dr. Andrs Guiloff, President of UNIACC, stated, "We are proud to join forces with Apollo Group. Together we will work to expand educational excellence in Chile. The combination of UNIACC's robust curriculum and expertise in the fields of arts and communications and Apollo's strength in delivering online programs will allow us to bring better standards of higher education to a growing number of students in Chile."
UNIACC is one of the leading arts and communications universities in Latin America and is renowned for its high-profile faculty and state-of-the-art technology. Accredited by the Chilean Council of Higher Education, UNIACC offers 18 bachelor's and two master's programs. In 2004, UNIACC became the first university in Chile to teach a fully online undergraduate program, and today offers six fully online and one blended program, mainly serving the needs of working adults.
With one of the fastest growing economies and highest post-secondary participation rates in the region, Chile's growth in private education currently outpaces that of the public sector. Today, Chilean private education accounts for half of all enrollments, with the majority of those residing in Santiago. With nearly seven million residents, Santiago has become one of Latin America's financial and industrial capitals, generating close to half of the national gross domestic product.
Apollo Group, Inc. has been providing academic access and opportunity to students for more than 30 years through its University of Phoenix, Institute for Professional Development, College for Financial Planning, Western International University, Insight Schools and Apollo Global entities.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On February 15, 2008, Apollo Group, Inc. posted a $95 million supersedeas bond (the "Bond") to stay the judgment rendered on January 30, 2008 by the United States District Court for the District of Arizona in a consolidated securities class action lawsuit brought by the Policemens Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago. The stay will remain in effect until the resolution of our post-trial motions for relief. We also entered into various agreements in order to post the Bond. In particular, on February 14, 2008, we entered into a Registered Pledge and Master Security Agreement (the "Master Agreement") with Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of America (the "Secured Party"), a Control Agreement (the "Control Agreement") with the Secured Party and Smith Barney Inc., and a General Contract of Indemnity (the "Indemnity Agreement") for the benefit of the Secured Party. Under the Master Agreement, we pledged our shares held in a Smith Barney Money Funds, Inc. Cash Portfolio (the "Shares") as co llateral to secure full payment of the Bond and to secure our general obligations under the Master Agreement and the Indemnity Agreement. Under the Master Agreement, we are subject to the customary restrictions, limitations and covenants that apply to similar types of collateral. The Control Agreement provides the Secured Party with the right to exclusive control over the Shares upon a default by us under the Master Agreement or the Indemnity Agreement. The Indemnity Agreement, among other things, indemnifies the Secured Party for any losses that it may incur as a result of furnishing us with the Bond and grants the Secured Party the right to use the Shares to satisfy claims against the Bond if we do not timely satisfy such claims.

Apollo Group, Inc.
News Release
Phoenix, Arizona, February 21, 2008  In recognition of significant uncertainty in the capital markets, Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOL) ("Apollo Group" or "the Company") today provided an update on several issues which could potentially impact the Company's liquidity and business. The Company is providing this information today; however, the Company may not provide this level of detail or provide further updates in the future except as it deems necessary.
"In light of the recent scrutiny of the student loan industry and current events in our business, we would like to assure investors of our financial stability, and to affirm that our students are not experiencing any interruptions in receiving the federal funding needed to support their education," said Joseph L. D'Amico, Apollo Group's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Mr. D'Amico added, "We continue to generate positive cash flow, have a very sound balance sheet and have available approximately $1 billion of liquidity. We believe this liquidity level will more than meet our business needs during this time of uncertainty in the capital markets."
Apollo Group has not experienced any interruption of Title IV student loan funding, which includes FFELP loans guaranteed by the government. In addition, the Company plans to add a fifth lender in the near future to its preferred lender list to provide students seeking loans with an even broader list of lender choices. The additional lender will offer FFELP loans directly and private loans through a third-party relationship.
Federal Family Education Loan Program ("FFELP") and Private Student Loans
As previously announced, tuition payments funded from third-party private loans continue to represent approximately four percent of the Company's revenue. Third-party private loans are generally utilized by students in the University of Phoenix's bachelor degree programs. The fastest growing sector of the Company's student body, University of Phoenix's associate degree students, do not require private loans to cover the cost of their program as the tuition levels are below Title IV loan limits.
Although the Company has seen some tightening of underwriting for students seeking private loans (measured as a percentage of applications approved relative to those submitted to a lender), students generally have had more than one choice of lenders and therefore, this tightening, to date, has not had a significant adverse impact on students in the Company's programs. As previously disclosed, the Company does not have recourse exposure on private student loans, with one exception of a minor private loan relationship. The total exposure on this loan program is less than $1 million.
Private loans have become more difficult to obtain for international students enrolled at the University of Phoenix. As such, some lenders have tightened their credit criteria or canceled their international programs. The Company is seeking alternative lenders to provide private loans to international students and may be required to pay an up-front amount of up to 10% of each loan to secure available financing for these students, which is consistent with certain previous programs for international students.
Recently, there have been reports about failed auctions in the auction rate securities market, and speculation with regard to the effect the failures may have on the liquidity of investors who hold these securities, such as Apollo Group. During the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company owned as much as $365 million in ARS  all in high quality (A rated and above) municipal securities, preferred stock and other tax-exempt bonds. As of February 19, 2008, all but $107 million of the ARS investments had been liquidated and not reinvested in the ARS market as the Company intentionally reduced its exposure to these instruments. Of the $107 million, approximately $79 million in ARS instruments were not liquidated due to failed auctions. Despite these failed auctions, there have been no defaults on the underlying securities, and investment income on these ARS holdings continues to be received in a timely manner. As a result, the interest rates on these failed ARS investments were reset and now have a weighted average tax-exempt interest rate of 5.2% compared to 4.5% prior to the failed auctions.
Auction Rate Securities ("ARS") and Liquidity Position
For the immediate future, the Company will maintain a more conservative investment portfolio given the uncertainties in the credit markets and expects investment income to reflect the conservative nature of these investments. As of February 19, 2008, the Company had approximately $1 billion in liquidity composed of approximately $500 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities (excluding student-related restricted cash and after posting the bond as discussed below), and a $500 million line of credit, which it has not drawn upon since its inception.
In motions filed on February 13, 2008, Apollo Group asked a federal district court in Arizona to set-aside, reverse or modify a recent verdict by a Phoenix jury in a consolidated securities class action brought by the Policemen's Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago. The Court stayed enforcement of the judgment while the post-trial motions are pending provided that Apollo post a bond in the amount of $95 million by February 19, 2008. On February 19, 2008, the Company posted the $95 million bond with the Court. Oral arguments have been requested; but a hearing date has not been set. If the Company's motions are denied, in whole or in part, it will consider an appeal. If an appeal is necessary, the Court may require the Company to post a bond in order to stay enforcement of the judgment during the appeal, and the bond could be in a different amount from the present bond. The Company believes it has adequate liquidity to fund any likely bond amount.
Status of Securities Litigation Matter
The Company previously reported that it had an option to sell its newly constructed headquarters buildings to the Macquarie Group ("Macquarie") for $170 million and expected the transaction to close during the Company's fiscal 2008 third quarter. The Company recently determined that it is Macquarie that has the option to purchase the buildings for $170 million. Macquarie made a non-refundable escrow deposit of $9 million in connection with this option. At this time, the Company does not know whether Macquarie will exercise its option to purchase the buildings. The Company expects to receive its Permanent Certificate of Occupancy for the building within the next several weeksAt that time, the Company will provide notice to Macquarie, and Macquarie will have five days to exercise its option. The Company's financial position and operating cash flows will not be materially adversely affected if Macquarie decides not to exercise its option. As stated above, as of February 19, 2008, the Company had approximately $1 billion of liquidity composed of approximately $500 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities (excluding student-related restricted cash and after posting the bond as discussed above), and a $500 million line of credit, which it has not drawn upon since its inception. Should Macquarie decide not to exercise its option, the Company plans to market the buildings to other parties, but no assurances can be given with respect to the timing or the amount of proceeds of any such sale.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
          This Current Report on Form 8-K (this "Form 8-K") is being filed to update and supersede the description of our capital stock contained in our prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on September 28, 2000 pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), in connection with Registration Statement No. 333-33370, including any amendments or reports we have filed for purposes of updating that description. This description will be available for incorporation by reference into certain of our filings with the SEC under the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including registration statements.
          References in this Form 8-K to "us," "we," "our," "Apollo," or "Apollo Group" mean Apollo Group, Inc., an Arizona corporation.
          
The following is a summary of the material terms of our authorized capital stock, which consists of our Class A common stock (167,798,000 shares outstanding as of March 20, 2008), our Class B common stock (475,000 shares outstanding as of March 20, 2008) (collectively, our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock may be referred to herein as our "Apollo Education Group common stock"), our University of Phoenix Online common stock (none of which is currently outstanding) and our preferred stock, issuable in series as determined by our board of directors from time to time (none of which is currently outstanding). This summary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable Arizona law and our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, and bylaws. We have filed our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, and bylaws with the SEC. See "Where You Can Find More Information and Incorporation by Reference" for information about how to obtain copies of these documents.
General
          Our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended (our "articles of incorporation"), provide authority for us to issue the following shares of our stock:
          University of Phoenix Online common stock was authorized and issued in 2000 with the intention that it would reflect or track the economic performance of University of Phoenix Online by incorporating terms that were designed to provide the holders of University of Phoenix Online common stock with economic rights in the business of University of Phoenix Online similar to the rights that common stock would have if University of Phoenix Online were a separate corporation. In August 2004, all of the issued and outstanding University of Phoenix Online common stock was converted into Class A common stock based on an election by our board of directors, and none of those shares are currently outstanding.
          Our articles of incorporation include various provisions designed to coordinate the respective rights of the University of Phoenix Online common stock on the one hand and the Apollo Education Group common stock on the other hand. The articles of incorporation also expressly provide, however, that specified sections shall apply only when there are shares of common stock outstanding in addition to
Table of Contents
Apollo Education Group common stock. Those sections do not currently apply because we have no common stock outstanding in addition to the Apollo Education Group common stock and we have no current intention to reissue such stock in the future. Those provisions might nevertheless be important to you if, at some future date, our board of directors caused us to reissue shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock.
Rights of Capital Stock When No University of Phoenix Online Common Stock is Outstanding
          As noted above, our articles of incorporation also expressly provide that specified sections shall apply only when there are shares of common stock outstanding in addition to Apollo Education Group common stock. Those sections do not currently apply because we have no common stock outstanding in addition to the Apollo Education Group common stock and we have no current intention to reissue such stock in the future. This section describes the rights of holders of our capital stock when no University of Phoenix Online common stock is outstanding and the only outstanding common stock consists of Series A common stock and Series B common stock. The section entitled "Additional Provisions That Will Apply if University of Phoenix Online Common Stock is Reissued" describes the additional provisions that will apply if University of Phoenix Online common stock were to be reissued.
     
Preferred Stock
          Under our articles of incorporation, preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series and may have such voting powers, redemption rights, dividend rights, rights upon dissolution or distribution of assets, conversion or exchange rights, designations, preferences and relative participating, optional and other special rights, if any, and such qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, as shall be provided by resolution of our board of directors.
     
Common Stock
          Holders of Class A common stock are not entitled to vote, unless a separate class vote is required by applicable law and on the limited matters described under "Limitation on Issuance of Class B Common Stock; Automatic Conversion" below in this section. With respect to any matter as to which holders of Class A common stock are entitled to vote, each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote on that matter. Holders of Class B common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters as to which holders of common stock generally are entitled to vote. Arizona law requires a separate vote of holders of shares of common stock of any class on any amendment to the articles of incorporation if the amendment would alter or change the powers, preferences, or special rights of the shares of that class.
Voting Rights.
          Although we are permitted to pay dividends on our Class A common stock and Class B common stock, we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. Dividends are payable at the discretion of our board of directors, and our articles of incorporation treat the declaration of dividends on the Class A common stock and Class B common stock in an identical manner as follows: holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to receive cash dividends, if and to the extent declared by our board of directors, payable to the holders of either class or both classes of common stock in equal or unequal per share amounts, at the discretion of our board of directors. We have no current plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. The decision of our board of directors to pay future dividends will depend on general business conditions, the effect of a dividend payment on our financial condition and other factors the board of directors may consider relevant.
Dividends.
          In any merger, consolidation or business combination of Apollo Group, the consideration received per share by the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock must be identical for each series of stock, except that in any such transaction in which shares of common stock are to be distributed, such shares may differ as to voting rights to the extent that voting rights differ among the Class A common stock and the Class B common stock.
Consideration on Merger, Consolidation, etc.
Table of Contents
          Class A common stock is not convertible into any other class of stock. Each share of Class B common stock is convertible into Class A common stock at any time at the option of the holder thereof on a share-for-share basis. Shares of Class B common stock that are converted into Class A common stock must be retired and canceled and may not be reissued. Shares of Class A common stock that are issued upon conversion of Class B common stock are, when so issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
Conversion Rights.
          No additional shares of Class B common stock may be issued, except pursuant to any recapitalization or stock split where such recapitalization or stock split results in a proportionate change in the shares of Class A common stock. If at any time the total number of shares of Class B common stock is less than 115,154 (subject to adjustment for any recapitalization or stock split), then each share of Class B common stock will automatically be converted into one fully paid and non-assessable share of Class A common stock, and thereafter each share of Class A common stock shall be entitled to one vote on all matters as to which holders of common stock generally are entitled to vote. The provisions described in this paragraph can be amended or modified only upon (1) a separate majority vote of the holders of Class A common stock voting as a class; (2) a separate majority vote of the holders of the Class B common stock voting as a class; and (3) a separate majority vote of the holders of the Class A common stock who do not possess beneficial ownership of any shares of Class B common stock.
Limitation on Issuance of Class B Common Stock; Automatic Conversion.
Additional Provisions That Will Apply if University of Phoenix Online Common Stock is Reissued
          If we issue University of Phoenix Online common stock in the future, the Apollo Education Group common stock will be intended to track the economic performance of Apollo Education Group. Apollo Education Group includes our other businesses besides University of Phoenix Online, as well as the interest in University of Phoenix Online not represented by outstanding shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock. In order to track the economic performance of each of University of Phoenix Online and Apollo Education Group, all of our consolidated assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses would have to be allocated between Apollo Education Group and University of Phoenix Online.
     
Dividends
          Our board of directors retains the discretion of whether or not to pay dividends on University of Phoenix Online common stock or Apollo Education Group common stock. However, we do not expect to pay dividends on any series of our common stock for the foreseeable future. If we pay dividends, the amount of dividends payable on any series of our common stock cannot exceed the amount legally available for the payment of dividends by us under Arizona law. Under Arizona law, a corporation may pay a dividend only if it is able to pay its debts as they become due and if it maintains positive net worth after the dividend is paid. Thus, when and if University of Phoenix Online common stock is issued and outstanding, it is possible that University of Phoenix Online could have positive operating results but losses at Apollo Education Group are so severe as to prevent payment of a dividend on University of Phoenix Online common stock.
          More specifically, although we do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, we would be permitted to pay dividends on:
Table of Contents
          The Apollo Education Group Available Dividend Amount and the University of Phoenix Online Available Dividend Amount are intended to be similar to the amounts that would be legally available for the payment of dividends on Apollo Education Group common stock and University of Phoenix Online common stock if:
          The "Apollo Education Group Available Dividend Amount" at any time is the amount that would then be legally available for the payment of dividends under Arizona law if:
          The "University of Phoenix Online Available Dividend Amount" at any time is the amount that would then be legally available for the payment of dividends on University of Phoenix Online common stock if University of Phoenix Online were a single, separate Arizona corporation having outstanding:
          There can be no assurance that there will be an Apollo Education Group Available Dividend Amount a University of Phoenix Online Available Dividend Amount at any time. Further, because the amount of dividends paid on University of Phoenix Online common stock cannot exceed the amount legally available for the payment of dividends by us under Arizona law, the legal ability to pay dividends will not necessarily link the performance of University of Phoenix Online with the market price of University of Phoenix Online common stock.
or
Table of Contents
          Subject to the prior payment of dividends on outstanding shares of preferred stock and the foregoing limitations, our board of directors could, in its sole discretion, declare and pay dividends exclusively on Apollo Education Group common stock, exclusively on University of Phoenix Online common stock, or on both in equal or unequal amounts. Our board of directors would have such discretion, notwithstanding the relative amounts of the Apollo Education Group Available Dividend Amount or the University of Phoenix Online Available Dividend Amount, the amount of prior dividends declared on any series of stock, the respective voting or liquidation rights of any series of stock, or any other factor.
          At the time of any dividend or other distribution on the outstanding shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock, we would credit to Apollo Education Group, and we would charge University of Phoenix Online, a corresponding amount in respect of Apollo Education Group's retained interest in University of Phoenix Online. Specifically, the corresponding amount would equal the aggregate amount of the dividend multiplied by a fraction:
This latter amount would also be treated as a dividend on University of Phoenix Online common stock and, accordingly, we would only be authorized to pay dividends to holders of University of Phoenix Online common stock if such amounts, combined with the amounts credited to Apollo Education Group, as determined above, equal or exceed the lesser of the University of Phoenix Online Available Dividend Amount and the amount available for the payment of dividends by us.
     
Mandatory Dividend, Redemption, or Conversion of Common Stock
          In general, if we reissue University of Phoenix Online common stock and then we dispose of 80% or more of the assets allocated to University of Phoenix Online, and the disposition is not an exempt disposition, we generally must either:
          For purposes of the preceding discussion, the holders' "proportionate interest" in the net proceeds of the disposition will equal the product of the net proceeds of the disposition, multiplied by a fraction:
Table of Contents
          Further, for purposes of the foregoing discussion, the term "exempt disposition" means any of the following:
          In connection with any dividend on, or redemption of, shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock as described above, we would credit to Apollo Education Group, and charge against University of Phoenix Online, a corresponding amount in respect of Apollo Education Group's retained interest in University of Phoenix Online. Specifically, the corresponding amount would equal the aggregate amount of the dividend or redemption proceeds multiplied by a fraction:
In addition, in connection with any partial redemption of University of Phoenix Online common stock as described above, we would decrease the number of shares issuable with respect to Apollo Education Group's retained interest in University of Phoenix Online by the same proportion as the proportionate decrease in outstanding shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock caused by such redemption.
Table of Contents
          Similar treatment would apply in connection with a disposition of 80% or more of the assets allocated to Apollo Education Group that is not an exempt disposition. In such case, we would either:
          For purposes of the immediately preceding discussion, the proportionate interest of holders of Class A common stock in the net proceeds of the disposition would equal the product of the net proceeds of the disposition, multiplied by a fraction:
     
Conversions of Stock at Our Option
          Assuming that assets are available therefore, if we reissue University of Phoenix Online common stock, we would have the right, at any time, to convert outstanding shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock to shares of Class A common stock. The number of shares receivable by holders of University of Phoenix Online common stock upon any such conversion would be based on the average market value of University of Phoenix Online common stock compared to the average market value of Class A common stock during the 20 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the 5th trading day preceding the date of notice of such conversion.
Conversion of University of Phoenix Online Common Stock Generally.
          Additionally, a 10% premium, payable in additional shares of Class A common stock, would be payable except as described in the next paragraph.
          However, no premium would be payable if the conversion occurs at any time after the aggregate market value of the outstanding University of Phoenix Online common stock shall have exceeded, for any 20 consecutive trading day period, 60% of the aggregate market value of the outstanding Class A common stock. Additionally, no premium would be payable if the conversion occurs after the occurrence of a tax event.
          For purposes of the preceding discussion, the term "tax event" refers to the receipt by us of an opinion of a tax advisor of ours experienced in such matters, to the effect that, as a result of any amendment to, clarification of, or change in, the laws, or any regulations thereunder, of the U.S. or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, including any announced proposed change by an administrative agency in such regulations, or as a result of any official or administrative pronouncement or
Table of Contents
action or judicial decision interpreting or applying such laws or regulations, there is more than an insubstantial risk that for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
For purposes of rendering such opinion, the tax advisor will assume that any administrative proposals will be adopted as proposed. However, in the event a change in law is proposed, the tax advisor will render an opinion only if the law is enacted.
          These conversion rights would allow our board of directors the flexibility to recapitalize the three series of our common stock into two series of common stock that would, after such recapitalization, represent an equity interest in all the businesses of us and our subsidiaries. This right was used in 2004 when our board of directors converted the then outstanding University of Phoenix Online common stock into Class A common stock, and it could be used again if we were to reissue shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock. The optional conversion rights could be exercised at any time, if, for example, our board of directors determined, that under the facts and circumstances then existing, an equity structure consisting of three series of common stock and an allocation of our assets between University of Phoenix Online and Apollo Education Group were no longer in the best interests of our shareholders.
          The conversion rights incorporated into University of Phoenix Online common stock were designed to strike an appropriate balance between:
          If we reissue shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock, we would have the right, at any time, to convert University of Phoenix Online common stock to stock of a subsidiary of ours so long as:
Conversion of University of Phoenix Online Common Stock to Stock of a Subsidiary of Ours.
          The shares of common stock of the subsidiary receivable by holders of University of Phoenix Online common stock in connection with such conversion of shares would represent the same proportionate interest in the equity of the subsidiary that the outstanding shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock are deemed to represent in the equity of University of Phoenix Online at the time of the conversion, taking into consideration for this purpose the retained interest of Apollo Education Group in University of Phoenix Online. The remaining shares of common stock of the subsidiary would either be retained by us or another subsidiary, or distributed to the holders of Apollo Education Group common stock, or a combination of the foregoing. If distributed to holders of Apollo Education Group common stock:
Table of Contents
          Similar conversion rights would apply if all of the assets and liabilities of Apollo Education Group are held by one or more subsidiaries of ours. In this case, if the number of shares issuable with respect to Apollo Education Group's retained interest in University of Phoenix Online on the date of conversion is greater than zero, we would also issue a number of shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock on the date of the conversion equal to the then current number of shares issuable with respect to Apollo Education Group's retained interest in University of Phoenix Online and deliver those shares to the holders of Apollo Education Group common stock or to the subsidiary.
     
General Conversion Provisions
          In the event of any conversion as described above under "Mandatory Dividend, Redemption or Conversion of Common Stock," and "Conversions of Stock at Our Option," we would cause to be given to each holder of shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock to be so converted, a notice setting forth:
          Such notice would be sent by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to such holder at such holder's address as the same appears on our transfer books or by such other methods as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors:
          Neither the failure to mail any notice described above to any particular holder of shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock nor any defect therein would affect the sufficiency thereof with respect to any other holder of outstanding shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock, or the validity of any such conversion.
          From and after any conversion of shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock, all rights of a holder of shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock that were converted would cease, except for the right, upon surrender of the certificates representing such shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock, to receive certificates representing shares of the kind and amount of capital stock, cash, and/or other securities or property for which such shares were converted, together with any fractional payment or rights to dividends as provided above, in each case without interest.

Voting Rights
          If shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock are reissued, then holders of University of Phoenix Online common stock would not be entitled to vote, unless a separate class vote is required by applicable law, in which case, each share would be entitled to one vote.
     
Liquidation
          If shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock are reissued, then in the event of the dissolution or liquidation and winding-up of us, whether voluntary or involuntary, holders of Apollo Education Group common stock and University of Phoenix Online common stock would be entitled to receive their proportionate interest in our assets, if any, remaining for distribution to shareholders after
          Such assets would be distributed to the holders of Apollo Education Group common stock and University of Phoenix Online common stock on a per share basis in proportion to the liquidation units per share of each series of common stock. For this purpose, each share of Apollo Education Group common stock would have one liquidation unit. Each share of University of Phoenix Online common stock would have a number of liquidation units, which may be a fraction of one liquidation unit, equal to the average market value of one share of University of Phoenix Online common stock during the 20 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the 5th trading day before the date of the first public announcement of:
divided by the average market value of one share of Class A common stock during such 20 trading day period.
          Thus, the liquidation rights of the holders of the Apollo Education Group common stock and University of Phoenix Online common stock may not bear any relationship to the respective values of the assets allocated to the Apollo Education Group and University of Phoenix Online. However, the liquidation rights of the holders of Apollo Education Group common stock and University of Phoenix Online common stock would bear a relationship to the respective market values of the respective shares at the time of the liquidation. No holder of Apollo Education Group common stock would have any special right to receive specific assets attributable to Apollo Education Group and no holder of University of Phoenix Online common stock would have any special right to receive specific assets attributable to University of Phoenix Online.
          Neither of the following events would alone be deemed a dissolution, liquidation, or winding-up of us for purposes of the liquidation provisions discussed above:
          Like other tracking stock, the liquidation provisions for University of Phoenix Online common stock and Apollo Education Group common stock would not provide shareholders with proceeds based directly on the value of the underlying assets and liabilities of each. However, because the relative market
Table of Contents
value of Class A common stock and University of Phoenix Online common stock may represent the best indirect proxy for the respective value of Apollo Education Group and University of Phoenix Online, the value realized by holders of Apollo Education Group common stock and University of Phoenix Online common stock upon our liquidation may approximate the value such holders would realize if liquidation were based on the market value of the underlying assets.
     
Apollo Education Group's Retained Interest in University of Phoenix Online
          If we issue University of Phoenix Online common stock in the future, our articles of incorporation provide that we will be entitled to retain a significant interest in University of Phoenix Online. Our retained interest in University of Phoenix Online would be subject to adjustment from time to time based upon certain events, including, but not limited to, the issuance of additional shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock, the repurchase of shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock, and as a result of dividends, distributions, stock subdivisions and combinations.
Determinations By The Board
          Our articles of incorporation provide that, subject to applicable law, any determinations made by our board of directors in good faith under our articles of incorporation are final and binding on all of our shareholders.
Preemptive Rights
          Holders of our common stock do not have any preemptive rights to subscribe for any additional shares of capital stock or securities that we may issue in the future.
Limitations on Potential Unsolicited Acquisitions; Anti-Takeover Considerations
          Because voting power is controlled by the Class B common stock which is controlled by our current management, an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, is rendered more difficult and protects the continuity of our management.
Effects of Arizona Law
     
Business Combinations
          Under Arizona law, any person who acquires 10% or more of the voting power of the common stock of a corporation is considered an "interested shareholder." For a period of three years after an acquisition, business combinations between us and the interested shareholder are prohibited, unless prior to the acquisition of the common stock by the interested shareholder, a committee of "disinterested" directors approves the acquisition of the common stock or the business combination. After the three-year period, generally the following three types of business combinations between us and the interested shareholder are permitted:
     
Control Share Acquisitions
          Under Arizona law, a party acquiring any class of our common stock may lose the right to vote some or all of those shares (except, generally, with respect to the election of directors), if the acquisition
Table of Contents
results in that party holding greater than 20%, 33%, or 50% of the outstanding common stock of that class. An acquiring party can avoid losing the right to vote these shares if the right to vote is approved by a majority of the disinterested shareholders. If approval of the right to vote shares is obtained at one of the specified levels, additional shareholder approvals are required when a shareholder seeks to acquire the power to vote shares at the next level.
          Unless otherwise provided in our articles of incorporation, our bylaws or as otherwise provided under Arizona law, we may call for redemption of all but not less than all of the acquiring party's common stock at a redemption price equal to the market value of the shares at the time the call for redemption is given if either:
     
Limitation on Share Repurchases
          Under Arizona law, we may not purchase or agree to purchase any shares from a beneficial owner of more than 5% of the voting power of our common stock for more than the "average market price" of the shares if the shares have been owned by the beneficial owner for less than three years unless either:
Indemnification and Limitation of Liability
          Our articles of incorporation permit us to indemnify a director or former director for any liability to any person for any action taken, or any failure to take any action, except liability for any of the following: (a) the amount of a financial benefit received by a director to which the director is not entitled; (b) an intentional infliction of harm on us or our shareholders; (c) a violation of Arizona Revised Statutes  10-833; or (d) an intentional violation of criminal law. Our articles of incorporation provide that our authority to so indemnify and make advances for expenses shall be in addition to (i) the provisions of Arizona law regarding indemnification and advancement for expenses, and (ii) the provisions of any contract or bylaw of ours dealing with indemnification or advancement of expenses. Our bylaws provide that each director and officer (and former director and officer) shall be indemnified from any liability related to his or her service to us, to the maximum extent permitted by Arizona law, and shall be entitled to advances for reasonable expenses as permitted by Arizona law. However, under our articles of incorporation, any contract or bylaw purporting to make indemnification or advancement of expenses mandatory shall not apply to the indemnification authority of our articles of incorporation, which shall remain discretionary. We have agreed to indemnify and advance expenses for certain of our executive officers as set forth in their employment agreements with us. In addition to the foregoing indemnification, we have also obtained insurance for the benefit of our directors and officers insuring such persons against certain liabilities.
          Arizona law generally provides that indemnification is permissible only when the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful. Subject to that standard of care and except as otherwise limited by a corporation's articles or Arizona law, indemnification is mandatory for "outside directors" as defined under Arizona law. Arizona law prohibits a corporation from indemnifying a director either (1) in connection with a proceeding by or in the right of the corporation in which the director was adjudged liable to the corporation, or (2) in connection with any other proceeding charging improper personal benefit to the director, whether or not
Table of Contents
involving action in the director's official capacity, in which the director was adjudged liable on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received by the director.
          Under Arizona law, a provision that treats a corporation's indemnification of or advancement for expenses to directors and that is contained in its articles of incorporation, its bylaws, a resolution of its shareholders or board of directors or a contract or otherwise is valid only if and to the extent the provision is consistent with Arizona law. If a corporation's articles of incorporation limit indemnification or advances for expenses, then indemnification and advances for expenses are valid only to the extent consistent with the articles.
          Under our articles of incorporation, any determination to indemnify or advance expenses pursuant to our articles of incorporation shall be made by our board of directors by a majority vote or any other authorizing method permitted by law, and any director who is a party to any proceeding or otherwise considered to be interested in such proceeding shall not be disqualified from voting with respect to any such determination if the director discloses his or her interest to the other directors.
Number of Directors; Removal
          Our articles of incorporation provide that the number of directors shall be not less than seven nor more than fifteen members, as established from time to time by our board of directors, and such directors shall serve one year terms or until his or her successor is elected. Our articles of incorporation allow for the removal of a director only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of shareholders holding at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.
Transfer Agent and Registrar
          Computershare is the registrar and transfer agent for our Class A common stock.

Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 14.1, the aggregate number of shares of Stock reserved and available for grant under the Plan shall be 24,079,228 (which number takes into account all stock splits from the Effective Date through January 30, 2008 and after the conversion of the University of Phoenix Online common stock into the Stock).

          (b) FOREIGN PARTICIPANTS. In order to assure the viability of Awards granted to Participants employed in foreign countries, the Committee may provide for such special terms as it may consider necessary or appropriate to accommodate differences in local law, tax policy, or custom. Moreover, the Committee may approve such supplements to, or amendments, restatements, or alternative versions of the Plan as it may consider necessary or appropriate for such purposes without thereby affecting the terms of the Plan as in effect for any other purpose; provided, however, that no such supplements, amendments, restatements, or alternative versions shall increase the share limitations contained in Section 5.1 of the Plan.
     6.2 ACTUAL PARTICIPATION. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee may, from time to time, select from among all eligible individuals, those to whom Awards shall be granted and shall determine the nature and amount of each Award. No individual shall have any right to be granted an Award under this Plan.
     7.1 GENERAL. The Committee is authorized to grant Options to Participants on the following terms and conditions:
          (a) EXERCISE PRICE. The exercise price per share of Stock under an Option shall be determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall the exercise price per share for any Option be less than the Fair Market Value per share of Stock on the actual grant date of that Option.
          (b) TIME AND CONDITIONS OF EXERCISE. The Committee shall determine the time or times at which an Option may be exercised in whole or in part. The Committee shall also determine the performance or other conditions, if any, that must be satisfied before all or part of an Option may be exercised. Unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, an Option will lapse immediately if a Participant's employment or services are terminated for Cause.
          (c) PAYMENT. The Committee shall determine the methods by which the exercise price of an Option may be paid, the form of payment, including, without limitation, cash, promissory note, shares of Stock (through actual tender or by attestation), or other property (including broker-assisted "cashless exercise" arrangements), and the methods by which shares of Stock shall be delivered or deemed to be delivered to Participants.
 
          (d) EVIDENCE OF GRANT. All Options shall be evidenced by a written Award Agreement between the Company and the Participant. The Award Agreement shall include such additional provisions as may be specified by the Committee.
     7.2 INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS. Incentive Stock Options shall be granted only to employees and the terms of any Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan must comply with the following additional rules:
          (a) EXERCISE PRICE. The exercise price per share of Stock shall be set by the Committee, provided that the exercise price for any Incentive Stock Option may not be less than the Fair Market Value as of the date of the grant.
          (b) EXERCISE. In no event may any Incentive Stock Option be exercisable for more than ten years from the date of its grant.
          (c) LAPSE OF OPTION. An Incentive Stock Option shall lapse under the following circumstances.

               (3) If the Participant terminates employment on account of Disability or death before the Option lapses pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) above, the Incentive Stock Option shall lapse, unless it is previously exercised, on the earlier of (i) the date on which the Option would have lapsed had the Participant not become Disabled or lived and had his employment status (i.e., whether the Participant was employed by the Company on the date of his Disability or death or had previously terminated employment) remained unchanged; or (ii) 12 months after the date of the Participant's termination of employment on account of Disability or death. Upon the Participant's Disability or death, any Incentive Stock Options exercisable at the Participant's Disability or death may be exercised by the Participant's legal representative or representatives, by the person or persons entitled to do so under the Participant's last will and testament, or, if the Participant fails to make testamentary disposition of such Incentive Stock Option or dies intestate, by the person or persons entitled to receive the Incentive Stock Option under the applicable laws of descent and distribution.
          (d) INDIVIDUAL DOLLAR LIMITATION. The aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the time an Award is made) of all shares of Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are first exercisable by a Participant in any calendar year may not exceed $100,000.00 or such other limitation as imposed by Section 422(d) of the Code, or any successor provision. To the extent that Incentive Stock Options are first exercisable by a Participant in excess of such limitation, the excess shall be considered Non-Qualified Stock Options.
 
          (e) TEN PERCENT OWNERS. An Incentive Stock Option shall be granted to any individual who, at the date of grant, owns stock possessing more than ten percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of Stock of the Company only if such Option is granted at a price that is not less than 110% of Fair Market Value on the date of grant and the Option is exercisable for no more than five years from the date of grant.
          (f) EXPIRATION OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS. No Award of an Incentive Stock Option may be made pursuant to this Plan after the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date.
          (g) RIGHT TO EXERCISE. During a Participant's lifetime, an Incentive Stock Option may be exercised only by the Participant.
     8.1 GRANT OF SARS. The Committee is authorized to grant SARs to Participants on the following terms and conditions:
          (a) RIGHT TO PAYMENT. Upon the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, the Participant to whom it is granted has the right to receive the excess, if any, of:
               (1) The Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of exercise; over
               (2) The exercise price per share of the Stock Appreciation Right as determined by the Committee, which shall in no event be less than the Fair Market Value per share of Stock on the actual grant date of that Stock Appreciation Right.
          (b) OTHER TERMS. All awards of Stock Appreciation Rights shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement. The terms, methods of exercise, methods of settlement, form of consideration payable in settlement, and any other terms and conditions of any Stock Appreciation Right shall be determined by the Committee at the time of the grant of the Award and shall be reflected in the Award Agreement.
     9.1 GRANT OF PERFORMANCE SHARES. The Committee is authorized to grant Performance Shares to Participants on such terms and conditions as may be selected by the Committee. The Committee shall have the complete discretion to determine the number of Performance Shares granted to each Participant. All Awards of Performance Shares shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement.
 
     9.2 RIGHT TO PAYMENT. A grant of Performance Shares gives the Participant rights, valued as determined by the Committee, and payable to, or exercisable by, the Participant to whom the Performance Shares are granted, in whole or in part, as the Committee shall establish at grant or thereafter. The Committee shall set performance goals and other terms or conditions to payment of the Performance Shares in its discretion which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number and value of Performance Shares that will be paid to the Participant.
     9.3 OTHER TERMS. Performance Shares may be payable in cash, Stock, or other property, and have such other terms and conditions as determined by the Committee and reflected in the Award Agreement.
     10.1 GRANT OF RESTRICTED STOCK. The Committee is authorized to make Awards of Restricted Stock to Participants in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as determined by the Committee. All Awards of Restricted Stock shall be evidenced by a Restricted Stock Award Agreement.
     10.2 ISSUANCE AND RESTRICTIONS. Restricted Stock shall be subject to such restrictions on transferability and other restrictions as the Committee may impose (including, without limitation, limitations on the right to vote Restricted Stock or the right to receive dividends on the Restricted Stock). These restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at such times, under such circumstances, in such installments, or otherwise, as the Committee determines at the time of the grant of the Award or thereafter.
     10.3 FORFEITURE. Except as otherwise determined by the Committee at the time of the grant of the Award or thereafter, upon termination of employment during the applicable restriction period, Restricted Stock that is at that time subject to restrictions shall be forfeited, provided, however, that the Committee may provide in any Restricted Stock Award Agreement that restrictions or forfeiture conditions relating to Restricted Stock will be waived in whole or in part in the event of terminations resulting from specified causes, and the Committee may in other cases waive in whole or in part restrictions or forfeiture conditions relating to Restricted Stock.
     10.4 CERTIFICATES FOR RESTRICTED STOCK. Restricted Stock granted under the Plan may be evidenced in such manner as the Committee shall determine, if certificates representing shares of Restricted Stock are registered in the name of the Participant, certificates must bear an appropriate legend referring to the terms, conditions, and restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock, and the Company may, at its discretion, retain physical possession of the certificate until such time as all applicable restrictions lapse.
 
     11.1 GRANT OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS. The Committee is authorized to grant Restricted Stock Unit Awards to Participants on such terms and conditions as may be selected by the Committee. The Committee shall have the complete discretion to determine the number of restricted stock units subject to each such Award. All Restricted Stock Unit Awards shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement.
     11.2 VESTING AND ISSUANCE PROVISIONS.
          (a) Shares of Stock issued pursuant to Restricted Stock Unit Awards may, in the discretion of the Committee, entitle the Participants to receive the shares of Stock underlying those Awards upon the attainment of designated performance objectives (which may, but need not, include one or more Performance Goals) or the satisfaction of specified employment or service requirements or upon the expiration of a designated time period or the occurrence of a designated event following the vesting of the Award , including (without limitation) a deferred distribution date following the termination of the Participant's employment or service. The vesting and issuance provisions applicable to each Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be set forth in the Award Agreement.
          (b) The Committee shall also have the discretionary authority, consistent with Code Section 162(m), to structure one or more Restricted Stock Unit Awards so that the shares of Common Stock subject to those Awards shall vest upon the achievement of pre-established corporate performance objectives based on one or more Performance Goals and measured over the performance period specified by the Committee at the time of the Award.
          (c) The Participant shall not have any stockholder rights with respect to the shares of Stock subject to a Restricted Stock Unit Award until that Award vests and the shares of Stock are actually issued thereunder. However, dividend-equivalent units may be paid or credited, either in cash or in actual or phantom shares of Stock, on outstanding Restricted Stock Unit Awards, subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may deem appropriate.
          (d) Outstanding Restricted Stock Unit Awards shall automatically terminate, and no shares of Stock shall actually be issued in satisfaction of those Awards, if the performance goals or employment or service requirements established for those Awards are not attained or satisfied. The Committee, however, shall have the discretionary authority to issue vested shares of Common Stock under one or more outstanding Restricted Stock Unit Awards as to which the designated performance goals or employment or service requirements have not been attained or satisfied. However, no vesting requirements tied to the attainment of Performance Goals may be waived with respect to Awards which were intended, at the time those Awards were made, to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m), except as otherwise provided in Section 11.2(e) or Section 13.8.
 
          (e) Each Restricted Stock Unit Award outstanding at the time of a Change in Control shall vest at that time, and the shares of Stock subject to those restricted stock units shall be issued as soon as administratively practicable following the closing of the Change in Control transaction, subject to the Company's collection of all applicable withholding taxes, or shall otherwise be converted into the right to receive the same consideration per share of Stock payable to the actual holders of the Stock in consummation of the Changer in Control and distributed at the same time as those stockholder payments. Such automatic vesting of the Restricted Stock Unit Awards shall occur pursuant to this Section 11.(e), even though such acceleration may result in their loss of performance-based status under Code Section 162(m).
     12.1 PURPOSE. The purpose of this Article 12 is to provide the Committee the ability to qualify the Performance Share Awards under Article 9, the Restricted Stock Awards under Article 10 and the Restricted Stock Unit Awards under Article 11 as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code. If the Committee, in its discretion, decides to grant a Performance-Based Award to a Covered Employee, the provisions of this Article 12 shall control over any contrary provision contained in Articles 9, 10 or 11.
     12.2 APPLICABILITY. This Article 12 shall apply only to those Covered Employees selected by the Committee to receive Performance-Based Awards. The Committee may, in its discretion, grant Restricted Stock Awards, Performance Share Awards or Restricted Stock Unit Awards to Covered Employees that do not satisfy the requirements of this Article 12. The designation of a Covered Employee as a Participant for a Performance Period shall not in any manner entitle the Participant to receive an Award for the period. Moreover, designation of a Covered Employee as a Participant for a particular Performance Period shall not require designation of such Covered Employee as a Participant in any subsequent Performance Period and designation of one Covered Employee as a Participant shall not require designation of any other Covered Employees as a Participant in such period or in any other period.
     12.3 DISCRETION OF COMMITTEE WITH RESPECT TO PERFORMANCE AWARDS. With regard to a particular Performance Period, the Committee shall have full discretion to select the length of such Performance Period, the type of Performance-Based Awards to be issued, the kind and/or level of the Performance Goal, and whether the Performance Goal is to apply to the Company, a Subsidiary or any division or business unit thereof.
     12.4 PAYMENT OF PERFORMANCE AWARDS. Unless otherwise provided in the relevant Award Agreement, a Participant must be employed by the Company or a Subsidiary on the last day of the Performance Period to be eligible for a Performance Award for such Performance Period. Furthermore, a Participant shall be eligible to receive payment under a Performance-Based Award for a Performance Period only if the Performance Goals for such
 
period are achieved. In determining the actual size of an individual Performance-Based Award, the Committee may reduce or eliminate the amount of the Performance-Based Award earned for the Performance Period, if in its sole and absolute discretion, such reduction or elimination is appropriate.
     12.5 MAXIMUM AWARD PAYABLE. The aggregate maximum Performance-Based Award payable to any one Participant under the Plan for Performance Period is one million (1,000,000) shares of Stock, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 14.1. In the event the Performance-Based Award is paid in cash, such maximum Performance-Based Award shall be determined by multiplying one million (1,000,000), subject to adjustment as provided in Section 14.1, by the Fair Market Value of one share of the applicable Stock as of the date of grant of the Performance-Based Award.
     13.1 STAND-ALONE AND TANDEM AWARDS. Awards granted under the Plan may, in the discretion of the Committee, be granted either alone, in addition to, or in tandem with, any other Award granted under the Plan. Awards granted in addition to or in tandem with other Awards may be granted either at the same time as or at a different time from the grant of such other Awards.
     13.2 EXCHANGE PROVISIONS. The Committee may at any time offer to exchange or buy out any previously granted Award for a payment in cash, Stock, or another Award, based on the terms and conditions the Committee determines and communicates to the Participant at the time the offer is made.
     13.3 TERM OF AWARD. The term of each Award shall be for the period as determined by the Committee, provided that in no event shall the term of any Incentive Stock Option or a Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with the Incentive Stock Option exceed a period of ten years from the date of its grant.
     13.4 FORM OF PAYMENT FOR AWARDS. Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable law or Award Agreement, payments or transfers to be made by the Company or a Subsidiary on the grant or exercise of an Award may be made in such forms as the Committee determines at or after the time of grant, including without limitation, cash, promissory note, Stock, other Awards, or other property, or any combination, and may be made in a single payment or transfer, in installments, or on a deferred basis, in each case determined in accordance with rules adopted by and at the discretion of, the Committee
     13.5 LIMITS ON TRANSFER. No right or interest of a Participant in any Award may be pledged, encumbered, or hypothecated to or in favor of any party other than the Company or a Subsidiary, or shall be subject to any lien, obligation, or liability of such Participant to any other party other than the Company or a Subsidiary. Except as otherwise provided by the Committee, no Award shall be assignable or transferable by a Participant other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
 
     13.6 BENEFICIARIES. Notwithstanding Section 13.5, a Participant may, in the manner determined by the Committee, designate a beneficiary to exercise the rights of the Participant and to receive any distribution with respect to any Award upon the Participant's death. A beneficiary, legal guardian, legal representative, or other person claiming any rights under the Plan is subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan and any Award Agreement applicable to the Participant, except to the extent the Plan and Award Agreement otherwise provide, and to any additional restrictions deemed necessary or appropriate by the Committee. If the Participant is married, a designation of a person other than the Participant's spouse as his beneficiary with respect to more than 50% of the Participant's interest in the Award shall not be effective without the written consent of the Participant's spouse. If no beneficiary has been designated or survives the Participant, payment shall be made to the person entitled thereto under the Participant's will or the laws of descent and distribution. Subject to the foregoing, a beneficiary designation may be changed or revoked by a Participant at any time provided the change or revocation is filed with the Committee.
     13.7 STOCK CERTIFICATES. All Stock certificates delivered under the Plan are subject to any stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee deems necessary or advisable to comply with Federal or state securities laws, rules and regulations and the rules of any national securities exchange or automated quotation system on with the Stock is listed, quoted, or traded. The Committee may place legends on any Stock certificate to reference restrictions applicable to the Stock.
     13.8 ACCELERATION UPON A CHANGE OF CONTROL. If a Change of Control occurs, all outstanding Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, and other Awards that relate to the grant of Stock shall become fully exercisable and all restrictions on such outstanding Awards shall lapse. Shares subject to outstanding Restricted Stock Unit Awards or Performance Share Awards shall vest and become immediately issuable at the closing of such Change in Control (or shall otherwise be converted into the right to receive the same consideration per share of Stock payable to the actual holders of the Stock in consummation of the Changer in Control and distributed at the same time as those stockholder payments). To the extent that this provision causes Incentive Stock Options to exceed the dollar limitation set forth in Section 7.2(d), the excess Options shall be deemed to be Non-Qualified Stock Options. Upon, or in anticipation of, such an event, the Committee may cause every Award outstanding hereunder to terminate at a specific time in the future and shall give each Participant the right to exercise such Awards during a period of time as the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, shall determine.
     14.1 GENERAL. In the event stock dividend is declared upon the Stock, the number of shares of Stock subject to the Plan and subject to each outstanding Award shall be increased proportionately, and the exercise price or issue price per share (if any) in effect for that Award shall also be equitably adjusted to reflect such stock dividend: provided, however, that that the aggregate exercise price or issue price shall remain the same. Should any change be made to the outstanding Stock by reason of any stock split or split-up, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares, spin-off transaction, extraordinary dividend or distribution or other
 
change affecting the outstanding Stock as a class effected without the Company's receipt of consideration, or should the value of outstanding shares of Stock be substantially reduced as a result of a spin-off transaction or an extraordinary dividend or distribution, or should there occur any merger, consolidation or other reorganization, then equitable adjustments shall be made by the Committee to the number and/or class of securities issuable under the Plan, the maximum number and/or class of securities for which Awards may be made to any one Participant and the number and/or class of securities subject to each outstanding Award and the exercise price or issue per share (if any) in effect for that Award in such manner as the Committee deems appropriate to preclude the dilution or enlargement of rights under such Award, and such adjustments shall be final, binding and conclusive; provided, however, that in the event of a Change of Control, the adjustments (if any) shall be made in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 13.8 governing Change of Control transactions. Notwithstanding the above, the conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected without the Company's receipt of consideration.
     15.1 AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION, AND TERMINATION. With the approval of the Board, at any time and from time to time, the Committee may terminate, amend or modify the Plan; provided, however, that to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with any applicable law, regulation, or stock exchange rule, the Company shall obtain shareholder approval of any Plan amendment in such a manner and to such a degree as required.
     15.2 AWARDS PREVIOUSLY GRANTED. No termination, amendment, or modification of the Plan shall adversely affect in any material way any Award previously granted under the Plan, without the written consent of the Participant.
     16.1 NO RIGHTS TO AWARDS. No Participant, employee, or other person shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and neither the Company nor the Committee is obligated to treat Participants, employees, and other persons uniformly.
     16.2 NO SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS. No Award gives the Participant any of the rights of a shareholder of the Company unless and until shares of Stock are in fact issued to such person in connection with such Award.
     16.3 WITHHOLDING. The Company or any Subsidiary shall have the authority and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy Federal, state, and local taxes (including the Participant's FICA obligation) required by law to be withheld with respect to any taxable event arising as a result of this Plan. With the Committee's consent, a Participant may elect to have the Company withhold from the
 
Stock that would otherwise be received upon the exercise of any Option or Stock Appreciation Right or the issuance of Stock pursuant to any vested Restricted Stock Unit Award, a number of shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum statutory amount necessary to satisfy the Participant's applicable federal, state, local and foreign income and employment tax withholding obligations with respect to such exercise or issuance.
     16.4 NO RIGHT TO EMPLOYMENT OR SERVICES. Nothing in the Plan or any Award Agreement shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate any Participant's employment or services at any time, nor confer upon any Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary.
     16.5 UNFUNDED STATUS OF AWARDS. The Plan is intended to be an "unfunded" plan for incentive compensation. With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant pursuant to an Award, nothing contained in the Plan or any Award Agreement shall give the Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company or any Subsidiary.
     16.6 INDEMNIFICATION. To the extent allowable under applicable law, each member of the Committee or of the Board shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company from any loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such member in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action or failure to act under the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in satisfaction of judgment in such action, suit, or proceeding against him or her provided he or she gives the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled under the Company's Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless.
     16.7 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BENEFITS. No payment under the Plan shall be taken into account in determining any benefits under any pension, retirement, savings, profit sharing, group insurance, welfare or other benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary.
     16.8 EXPENSES. The expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company and its Subsidiaries.
     16.9 TITLES AND HEADINGS. The titles and headings of the Sections in the Plan are for convenience of reference only, and in the event of any conflict, the text of the Plan, rather than such titles or headings, shall control.
     16.10 FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fractional shares of stock shall be issued and the Committee shall determine, in its discretion, whether cash shall be given in lieu of fractional shares or whether such fractional shares shall be eliminated by rounding up or down as appropriate.
 
     16.11 SECURITIES LAW COMPLIANCE. With respect to any person who is, on the relevant date, obligated to file reports under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, transactions under this Plan are intended to comply with all applicable conditions of Rule 16b-3 or its successors under the Exchange Act. To the extent any provision of the Plan or action by the Committee fails to so comply, it shall be void to the extent permitted by law and voidable as deemed advisable by the Committee.
     16.12 GOVERNMENT AND OTHER REGULATIONS. The obligation of the Company to make payment of awards in Stock or otherwise shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by government agencies as may be required. The Company shall be under no obligation to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, any of the shares of Stock paid under the Plan. If the shares paid under the Plan may in certain circumstances be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Company may restrict the transfer of such shares in such manner as it deems advisable to ensure the availability of any such exemption.
     16.13 GOVERNING LAW. The Plan and all Award Agreements shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Arizona.

 
       
Revenue increases approximately 14% year-over-year
Total Degreed Enrollment increases 10.7% year-over-year
Phoenix, Arizona, March 27, 2008  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOL) ("Apollo Group" or "the Company") today reported unaudited financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2008, which ended February 29, 2008.
Unaudited Second Quarter of Fiscal 2008 Results of Operations
Consolidated revenues for the three months ended February 29, 2008, totaled $693.6 million, which represents a 13.9% increase over the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Total Degreed Enrollment grew by 10.7% year-over-year to 330,200.
The Company reported a net loss for the three months ended February 29, 2008, of $32.0 million, or $0.19 per share (168.0 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to net income of $60.3 million, or $0.35 per share (174.6 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended February 28, 2007. Included in the 2008 results is a pre-tax charge of $168.4 million which represents an accrual for estimated damages stemming from the securities class action lawsuit. The actual amount of damages will not be known until all court proceedings, including post trial motions and any appeals, have been completed. However, for financial reporting purposes, the Company has estimated damages and associated expenses in the range of $120.5 million to $216.4 million and has accrued for the mid-point of the range.
Before giving effect to the litigation charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, and to special items related to the stock option investigation and restatement costs of $5.7 million and share-based compensation of $12.1 million that was associated with stock option modifications in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, net income was $70.3 million, or $0.41 per share (170.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, as compared to net income of $71.2 million, or $0.41 per share (174.6 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Excluding the litigation charge of $168.4 million and share-based compensation expense of $20.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 and share-based compensation expense and special items of $27.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, net income would have been $82.6 million, or $0.48 per share (170.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, as compared to net income of $77.0 million, or $0.44 per share (174.6 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. (See the reconciliation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
"We reported solid revenue and enrollment growth in the second quarter, and continue to invest for the long-term success of the Company. The demand for high-quality and accessible education continues, and we believe our academic system and technology positions us well to meet this demand," said Brian

Mueller, President of Apollo Group. "During the second quarter, we successfully integrated Aptimus into our organization and we are very pleased with both their technology and their talented personnel. Having this marketing expertise in-house will enable us to continue to innovate and enhance our branding and recruiting efforts more effectively. We also announced our first Apollo Global transaction during the quarter, and we look forward to leveraging our strengths in the international arena."
Mr. Mueller concluded, "Apollo Group continues to focus on delivering the highest quality educational programs and services to our students. Our goal is to positively impact our students' lives while also creating value for our shareholders. We remain committed to our long-term goals of mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth and low double-digit operating profit and free cash flow growth."
Instructional costs and services increased by $33.3 million, or 11.3%, to $327.7 million for the three months ended February 29, 2008, from the three months ended February 28, 2007. As a percentage of net revenue, instructional costs and services declined to 47.2% versus 48.4% in the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of decreases as a percentage of net revenue, in classroom lease expenses and depreciation, other instructional costs and bad debt expense. These decreases were partially offset by an increase, as a percentage of net revenue, in financial aid processing costs and share-based compensation expense.
The 60 basis point year-over-year decline in other instructional costs, as a percentage of net revenue, was due largely to lower negotiated contract costs from third-party vendors, partially offset by continued investments in Insight Schools. The increase in financial aid processing costs is primarily due to increased processing volume.
With respect to bad debt expense, as previously reported, during the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company reviewed the components of bad debt expense and identified certain items that should have been classified as discounts or refunds (reduction of tuition revenue) rather than bad debt expense. No reclassification was made for prior periods as the amounts were not material to prior period financial statements and had no effect on reported net income. Had the Company reclassified these items in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the amounts reported for net revenue, and bad debt expense would have been $5.2 million lower. On a comparable basis, bad debt expense as a percentage of net revenue, increased approximately 30 basis points from 3.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 to 3.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, yet declined from 4.2% in the previous quarter. The year-over-year increase is primarily due to the continuing trend of having a higher percentage of students enrolled in associate's degree programs.
Selling and promotional expenses increased by $34.8 million, or 20.9%, to $201.7 million for the three months ended February 29, 2008, from the three months ended February 28, 2007. As a percentage of net revenue, selling and promotional expenses increased to 29.1%, from 27.4% in the prior year's quarter. This was largely a result of an increase, as a percentage of net revenue, in enrollment counselors' compensation and related expenses and other selling and promotional expenses. Included in other selling and promotional costs are expenses related to Aptimus which the Company acquired in the first quarter of 2008. Advertising costs as a percentage of net revenue, declined slightly as a percentage of net revenue.
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses for the three months ended February 29, 2008, were $55.0 million, essentially flat versus the prior year's quarter. As reported, G&A, as a percentage of net revenue, declined to 7.9% in the second quarter of 2008, versus 9.1% in the comparable period a year ago. Excluding special items in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, primarily related to the stock option investigation and restatement costs of $5.7 million and share-based compensation related to a stock
2
 
option modification of $12.1 million, G&A expenses were $37.8 million, or 6.2% of net revenue, for the three months ended February 28, 2007. The increase to 7.9%, as a percentage of net revenue, in the second quarter of 2008, is mainly attributable to increases as a percentage of net revenue, in salary and related payroll costs due to higher employee headcount.
Financial and Operating Metrics
Below are Apollo Group's unaudited financial data and operating metrics for the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Note that for the quarter ended November 30, 2007, the Company previously reported New Degreed Enrollments of 67,400, an increase of 7.8%. The actual number was 68,700, a 9.9% increase. The Company had an additional 1,100 New Degreed Enrollments in its bachelor's program and 200 in its master's program which were not included in the previously reported total.

Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of February 29, 2008, the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash, totaled $536.9 million as compared to $392.7 million as of August 31, 2007. Also excluded from this balance at February 29, 2008, is $95.0 million of cash held as collateralization for a bond posted by the Company in connection with the securities class action verdict.
At February 29, 2008, accounts receivable declined to $160.5 million from $190.9 million at August 31, 2007, resulting in days sales outstanding ("DSO") declining to 30 days for the second quarter as compared to 37 days in the second quarter of 2007, and from 38 days at August 31, 2007. The decrease in DSO year-over-year and since August 31, 2007, is primarily due to improvements in the Company's processing time for the receipt of student financial aid, the write-off of approximately $38 million in previously reserved uncollectible accounts receivable during the quarter, and the seasonality the Company experienced in its second quarter. As a result of this seasonality, DSO may increase in the third quarter.
Deferred tax assets increased by $78.7 million to $209.6 million at February 29, 2008, from $131.0 million at August 31, 2007, mainly due to the accounting for the tax effects of the litigation charge described above.
Deferred revenue at February 29, 2008, increased to $174.4 million from $167.3 million at August 31, 2007, and increased from $146.8 million at February 28, 2007. The increase from the prior year quarter is principally due to increased student enrollment and volume.
Unaudited First Six Months of Fiscal 2008 Results of Operations
Consolidated revenues for the six months ended February 29, 2008, were $1.5 billion, a 15.5% increase over the first six months of fiscal 2007. Average Degreed Enrollment grew by 11.0% for the six months ended February 29, 2008 as compared to the six months ended February 28, 2007.
The Company reported net income of $107.8 million, or $0.63 per share, (169.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to $174.2 million, or $1.00 per share, (174.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the six months ended February 29, 2008, and February 28, 2007, respectively.
Before giving effect to the litigation charge of $168.4 million in the six months ended February 29, 2008, and to special items related to the stock option investigation and restatement costs of $7.7 million and share-based compensation of $12.1 million that was associated with stock option modifications in the six months ended February 28, 2007, net income was $210.1 million, or $1.24 per share (169.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) in the first six months of fiscal 2008, as compared to net income of $186.3 million, or $1.07 per share (174.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) in the first six months of fiscal 2007. Excluding the litigation charge of $168.4 million, and total share-based compensation of $35.0 million in the first six months of fiscal 2008 and share-based compensation expense and special items of $39.6 million in the first six months of fiscal 2007, net income would have been $231.4 million, or $1.36 per share (169.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) in the first six months of fiscal 2008, as compared to net income of $198.4 million, or $1.14 per share (174.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) in the first six months of fiscal 2007. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)

Exhibit 99.1
Phoenix, Arizona, April 1, 2008  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or "the Company") today announced that its consolidated subsidiary, Apollo Global, Inc., has completed its previously announced acquisition of Universidad de Artes, Ciencias y Comunicacin ("UNIACC"), an accredited, private arts and communications university in Chile, as well as its related entities. This includes the Instituto Superior de Artes y Ciencias de la Comunicacin, S.A. ("IACC"), the first online autonomous professional institute in Chile which was founded in 1981. This is Apollo Global's first transaction.
"We welcome the UNIACC team to Apollo and look forward to leveraging our strengths to expand UNIACC's success in the Chilean marketplace," said Greg Cappelli, Chairman of Apollo Global. "Apollo Global is committed to capitalizing on the tremendous global opportunity that exists in education, and as it is known for its stable economic environment, solid student enrollment trends, and openness to foreign investment, Chile is an excellent place for us to start."
"The UNIACC and Apollo Global union reaffirms the progressive vision upon which UNIACC was founded 27 years ago," said Andres Guiloff, President and founder of UNIACC. "It represents an unprecedented opportunity for us to create new and better pathways to learning for students in Chile at various stages of their professional lives  pathways that reflect an educational experience for the global world we live in  one in which creative, flexible and open-minded graduates are highly valued."
Under the terms of the transaction, which was announced on February 19, 2008, Apollo Global, Inc. agreed to purchase 100% of UNIAAC. The purchase price is approximately $44 million composed of cash and assumed debt, plus an earn-out based on a multiple of earnings to be paid in four years. If the earn-out were paid based on current earnings it would be approximately $9 million. The increase in the purchase price from the initial announcement is primarily a result of changes in the currency exchange rate as well as transaction fees.
UNIACC will continue to be based in Santiago, Chile. It is one of the leading arts and communications universities in Latin America and is renowned for its high-profile faculty and state-of-the-art technology. Accredited by the Chilean Council of Higher Education, UNIACC offers 18 bachelor's and two master's programs. In 2004, UNIACC became the first university in Chile to teach a fully online undergraduate program, and today offers six fully online and one blended program, mainly serving the needs of working adults.

News Release
Phoenix, Arizona, May 13, 2008 Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOL) ("Apollo Group", "Apollo" or "the Company") today announced that it plans to establish a new Canadian institution, named Meritus University ("Meritus" or "the University"). Following review of program proposals by the Maritime Provinces Higher Education Commission, Meritus University has received approval to offer its first three programs from the New Brunswick Department of Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour, thereby establishing degree-granting status. Meritus University will be based in Fredericton, New Brunswick, offering complete degree programs online to working professionals throughout Canada and abroad.
"We understand there is a value to Canadian education that transcends Canadian borders," said Greg Cappelli, executive vice president of global strategy for Apollo Group. "Meritus University's mission is to meet Canada's growing demand for advanced education, while making Canadian education, which is highly-regarded internationally, accessible worldwide."
Brian Mueller, president of Apollo Group, added, "With nearly a decade of presence in Canada through Apollo's University of Phoenix, Meritus University is delivering what Canadian students have been telling us they want  academic programs that are competitively-priced and market-relevant, taught by Canadian faculty who hold substantial positions across a wide spectrum of Canadian industries. Meritus University will reflect what Apollo's institutions are known for and what Canadian students say their education be  mobile, global and very effective."
should
New Brunswick is an attractive location because of its positive regulatory and business environment. Building upon Apollo Group's advanced student support systems and New Brunswick's highly-skilled labor pool, Meritus University is expected to be operational later this year.
Minister of Business New Brunswick, Greg Byrne, said, "Meritus will be a welcomed addition to the Fredericton business community. As we chart the course toward self-sufficiency, we know how important it is to create economic opportunities for the people of New Brunswick. Being the home of one of the oldest public universities in North America, and now the newest online degree-granting university in the world, speaks volumes about the progressive business and education environment in New Brunswick."
The three programs approved by the Department are the Master of Business Administration, Bachelor of Business Administration and the Bachelor of Information Technology Management. Meritus University will not seek U.S. accreditation.
Meritus University, Inc. is a New Brunswick, Canada, corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apollo NB Holding Company, which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apollo Group, Inc. Meritus University's mission is to foster relevant and innovative learning that meets the needs of diverse student populations, their employers and communities. Adapting programs to an ever-changing world, Meritus' educational philosophy facilitates critical thinking, collaboration and leadership by integrating academic theory with best-practice applications.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
     EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The first University of Phoenix Academic Annual Report contains a transparent look at a variety of ways in which the University of Phoenix measures itself in relation to its Mission and social agenda of access and inclusion. The Report was created within the framework laid out by the Spellings Report: access, accountability, quality, and affordability.
The University's role in providing access to higher education has grown over the last thirty-plus years from a degree-completion institution to a comprehensive university offering associate, baccalaureate, graduate, and doctoral degree programs. An institutional culture of assessment has led to a robust internal set of measurements that inform a system of accountability and continuous improvement. Using data from numerous sources, the University reallocates, adjusts, and reinvests its resources to meet the ongoing needs of the students. This reinvestment includes a sophisticated technology infrastructure that both enriches content and enhances delivery.
The Report examines University quality and performance in the context of external measures of success including the Educational Testing Service (ETS) MAPP assessment. Results show that as a group, University of Phoenix students make significant progress in basic content areas from freshman to senior levels. University of Phoenix students often enter their studies with lower scores in the general education areas as compared to more exclusive institutions but perform at levels comparable to seniors at other institutions by the time they graduate.
The University's role in providing access to higher education has grown over the last thirty-plus years from a degree-completion institution to a comprehensive university...
The Report also includes comparative data from the Standardized Assessment of Information Literacy Skills (SAILS). Results in this instance show that University of Phoenix students performed comparably to or better than students at other institutions surveyed.
Because of an open-access admissions policy, a large number of the University of Phoenix students enter the University with a high number of risk factors (as defined by the Department of Education). Despite increased risk factors for completion and lower incoming skills, completion rates for the University are comparable to those reported nationally.
Finally, this Report analyzes the University's financial accountability. Reinvestment of resources into curriculum and technology is highlighted, as well as the issue of affordability of tuition. As a for-profit University operating in the public sector, it is shown that University of Phoenix actually pays back monies to taxpayers for every student it educates as opposed to the costs accrued to taxpayers by its tax-exempt public and non-profit counterparts in higher education.

     INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW
Mission and Social Agenda
University of Phoenix (UPX) was founded on an agenda of social responsibility to provide educational access to underserved populations. This agenda has served the University and its students well, and the doctrines underpinning that agenda have become an integral part of the culture at University of Phoenix.
UPX has been dedicated to a sector of the population that holds great promise for the future of the country  the middle class. Studieshave shown that a college-educated citizenry is beneficial to the overall health of society. An educated populace results in higher employment rates, better levels of health, and more civic engagement. These factors are all key to the University's Mission.

Associate Programs
But providing educational opportunities to all Americans who wish to avail themselves is fraught with challenge. Nationally, approximately half of all incoming freshmenrequire remedial services and 72 percent of all colleges and universities offer remedial coursework. University of Phoenix has worked hard to level the playing field for our students. As an open-access university at the undergraduate level, we have been successful in accepting students who might have been denied admission at other institutions, and we have provided them with the opportunity and tools for success.

Over the years, the University's institutional and academic maturity has led to its evolution from a degree-completion institution to a comprehensive university, incorporating a range of teaching and learning models. The faculty's focus is on teaching and serving students as interactive learning coaches. Today the University serves more than 300,000 students, has a cadre of more than 20,000 faculty members, and has graduated more than 400,000 alumni.

ACCOUNTABILITY
Assessment and Continuous Improvement
University of Phoenix places significant emphasis on the importance of assessing student learning. What is gleaned from the assessment process provides the roadmap for continuous improvement at the University. The first step in any assessment process is to agree upon and clearly delineate expected outcomes. To ensure that our students can and do achieve the same skill levels as their contemporaries, the University established university-wide Learning Goals. These goals apply to each student in every program at all degree levels and are incorporated into curricula, instruction, and assessment approaches. These Learning Goals help ensure that University of Phoenix graduates possess the qualities former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich noted as requirements for workers in the new economy, "...to think, solve problems, and learn how to apply skills in new contexts."
4
The University's Learning Goals are as follows:
Professional Competence and Values
Graduates of University of Phoenix will have mastered a specific array of disciplinary knowledge and abilities, and will be able to apply their knowledge immediately in real-world settings. They will demonstrate values and ethics appropriate to their discipline and engage in lifelong learning to improve their professional competence and practice.
Critical Thinking and Problem Solving
Graduates of University of Phoenix will reason clearly and critically. They will be problem solvers, able to identify and evaluate problems, utilize critical thinking skills to recommend and select among alternative solutions, implement solutions and evaluate consequences.
Communication
Graduates of University of Phoenix will communicate verbally and in writing in a clear, concise and correct manner. They will use proper grammar and punctuation. They will analyze the needs and abilities of their audiences, choose from a variety of communication tools, adjust the content of messages, and deliver their messages accordingly.
Information Utilization
Graduates of University of Phoenix will be adept at accessing and utilizing information. They will research issues, gather information from a variety of sources, analyze the plausibility and accuracy of information regardless of source, and utilize information appropriately to address issues or inform action.
Collaboration
Graduates of University of Phoenix will work effectively in diverse groups and teams to achieve tasks. They will be collaborators, able to function well in team settings as both leaders and followers. They will respect diversity and behave in a tolerant manner toward colleagues and those they serve.
The Assessment Process
The University has developed a robust assessment process that comprises an all-encompassing Institutional Quality Improvement System. The purpose of the Institutional Quality Improvement System is to provide evidence that the institution is meeting its
6
 
mission through continuous assessments based on a comprehensive array of quality control and assurance instruments. A major component of this plan is the assessment of student learning.
The University's continuous search for the best ways to assure quality control led to the adoption of an Academic Assessment Plan (AAP), designed to demonstrate that our graduates meet programmatic and University Learning Goals. The AAP is comprised of four ongoing and iterative steps. These include:
In order to ensure students are meeting the goals, each college has developed an assessment matrix that outlines specific learning outcomes aligned to the University Learning Goals. Multiple methods have been identified to assess each outcome. Additionally, to ensure the assessments are both reliable and valid, the Department of Learning Assessment employs trained external evaluators who use scoring rubrics that support the evaluation of authentic assessment.
The ingrained culture of assessment at the University provides the administration with the ability to "close the loop." Taking the information gained through the assessment process, the University is able to appropriately allocate time, resources, and technological expertise to improve the student learning experience and enhance student success.
The ability to fully integrate assessment into University-wide systems, from learning outcomes to student satisfaction, has afforded University of Phoenix a unique opportunity to reinvest resources. This is discussed more fully later in the Report under the section
Financial Accountability.

     ACCESS: A PHILOSOPHY OF INCLUSION
Our Students
In 2007 the University of Phoenix was listed by the magazine as having graduated the largest number of underrepresented students in master's degree programs.
Diverse Issues in Higher Education
Throughout its history the University has sought to provide access to higher education to underserved populations. The diversity index at the University of Phoenix is well above the national average  expanding the scholarly community and providing greater opportunities for underrepresented populations to advance their personal and professional lives.
In terms of gender, women make up the majority of the student body at the University of Phoenix. The percentage of female-to-male students is slightly higher than the national average.

Our Faculty
The University employs a strong cadre of carefully selected academics as the Core Faculty that oversees curriculum and instruction. The Core Faculty is complemented by a large team of Associate Faculty members with advanced academic degrees and years of experience in the fields in which they teach. Our faculty help students relate to the world of work, help them make connections between theoretical and practical application, and bring immediate relevance to content.
The University currently has a faculty of over 20,000 Associate Faculty and approximately 1,500 Core Faculty members.
University of Phoenix encourages a culture of disciplined inquiry among its faculty and a commitment to keeping themselves professionally up to date. These are important factors necessary to implement all aspects of its Mission. University of Phoenix faculty members are therefore encouraged to be, and are rewarded for being, actively involved in academic and professional scholarly activities.

     QUALITY
The following sets of data represent baseline information that measures the success of University assessment systems internally and compares those results to national norms using third-party, standardized tools. Although this first pass is not perfect in all aspects, it sets a baseline for continued assessment of our systems as gauged by our own systems and comparisons to external norms.
Student Satisfaction Surveys
Recently, institutions of higher education have put additional focus on student satisfaction. Annually Noel-Levitz,an educational management company, conducts and publishes the National Student Satisfaction and Priorities Report. The report suggests that institutions can use the results to "gauge whether an institution is providing an experience that students deem worthwhile." Current research supports the link between student perceived value and satisfaction, to retention, motivation, and even student success.

ETS MAPP
The Educational Testing Service (ETS) is a non-profit organization whose mission is to "advance quality and equity in education for all people worldwide." ETS administers the MAPP (Measure of Academic Proficiency and Progress) assessment, a test of college-level skills in critical thinking, reading, writing, and mathematics, to undergraduate students. The assessment was developed to assist institutions in the assessment of the outcomes of general education programs to improve the quality of instruction and learning.

ETS defines "college level" skills for each of the four areas of assessment as:

Reading questions measure students' ability to...
Writing questions measure students' ability to...
Critical thinking questions measure students' ability to...

A total of 1,966 University of Phoenix students voluntarily participated in the MAPP assessment. It was administered online.
As shown on the following tables, University of Phoenix students were compared...

The effect size (Cohen's d) for the means is between 0.20  0.50.
As the following graph shows, UPX students enter with critical thinking scores a little lower than their counterparts at all institutions. However, by the time they reach their senior year, UPX students have mastered these skills at comparable levels to other students.
MAPP-Freshmen vs. Seniors  Critical Thinking Score Comparison
UPX students begin with a reading level skill scoring below students at all institutions in the US and at about the same level as students at master's level institutions. When they graduate, UPX students' reading skills have increased at rates comparable to their peers.
MAPP-Freshmen vs. Seniors  Reading Score Comparison

Students at the University of Phoenix spend a great deal of time writing assignments and communicating. As exemplified in the following graph, although UPX students enter with writing skills at a considerably lower level than students at other institutions, by the time they graduate, writing skill scores have risen to comparable levels as their peers at other institutions.
MAPP-Freshmen vs. Seniors  Writing Score Comparison
As an open-admissions institution at the undergraduate level, University of Phoenix accepts students with varying abilities in mathematics. As the graph below shows, this particular skill set for entering students is well below other institutions. By the time the students are seniors, the mathematics skills scores have risen significantly.

SAILS Standardized Assessment
The Standardized Assessment of Information Literacy Skills(SAILS) is a 40-item standardized, multiple-choice assessment designed to measure undergraduate students' information literacy skills. More specifically, the SAILS program is used to assess the following skill sets:
10
The skills sets are based on the Association of College and Research Libraries' (ACRL) Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education: Standards, Performance Indicators, and Outcomes. The standards on which the SAILS assessment is based are as follows:
11
The information literate student...
 
In December 2007 a total of 14,636 University of Phoenix undergraduate students were contacted via email and asked to take the SAILS assessment voluntarily. The invitation was sent to a group comprised of 5,256 associate degree students and 9,380 baccalaureate students. The latter group of students was selected at random from across all undergraduate academic programs. The associate degree-seeking students were randomly selected from the overall pool of Sophomores (those students who had completed between 31 and 60 credits) enrolled in the Associate of Arts in Business program. Due to the presence of email scanning devices on some student computers, not all the students received the email invitation to participate in the SAILS assessment. A total of 1,170 students completed the assessment, for a response rate of 7.99%.
16
 
The results were used to compare University of Phoenix students in a variety of ways. The first was to compare University of Phoenix students to other students at all institutions of higher education participating in the SAILS program. This included two-year community colleges, baccalaureate institutions, as well as master's institutions.
The following results for the University of Phoenix students showed that they:

After comparisons to other institutions were completed, the information was used to compare University of Phoenix students to one another. In a comparison of entering Freshmen (those successfully completing from 1 to 30 credits) to those who were Seniors (those having successfully completed 90 or more credits) the data showed that the Seniors:

SAILS University of Phoenix Internal Comparison
University of Phoenix Freshmen vs Seniors
As an institution with significant student populations both in the physical classroom and online, University of Phoenix is well positioned to compare student performance in the two modalities. In this regard, two sample groups were identified. The first were the campus-based students who completed the majority of their courses (at least 75 percent) through the traditional venue of the physical classroom. The comparison group was made up of students who completed 100 percent of their courses through the online venue. The results were as follows:

SAILS University of Phoenix Modality Comparison
University of Phoenix On Campus students vs Online students
These findings are in accord with the "No Significant Difference Phenomenon" as cited by Thomas Russell in his 2001 bookof the same name, with one exception. In the University of Phoenix SAILS comparison, students taking 100 percent of their courses online were able to develop a research strategy better than the campus based students, but in all other areas online and campus students were found to have equivalent skills.
12
As with all quantitative research, the analytic framework is limited. When interpreting the results of the SAILS Program research with the University of Phoenix students, it should be noted that the sample pool did not represent a pure random sample, and the small sample sizes in some response categories led to larger standard errors. The SAILS
20
 
program allows institutions to self-select the institution type (e.g. bachelor's, master's, doctoral). Benchmark comparisons are based on these classifications, and some of the items in the assessment may not apply to University of Phoenix students.
Predictors of College Success
A number of predictors of student success (or lack thereof) in higher education have been researched over the years. Most national sources cite high school grades, most specifically the Grade Point Average (GPA), as a common forecaster. This is shown below.
High School GPA as Predictor of Degree Completion
High School Grades vs. USA Bachelor Completion
Data Source: Degree Attainment Rates at American Colleges and Universities, January, 2005.
The University of Phoenix has identified other predictors, one of the most salient of which is the number of transfer credits students enter the University with, as indicated in the graph below.
Transfer Credits vs. UPX Bachelor Completion Rate (%)
Data Source: UPX cohort 11/1998 to 3/2000.
21
 
Inclusion and reaching out to underserved populations are at the heart of the University's Mission. The University of Phoenix admission requirements to the associate and baccalaureate programs are that students must have successfully completed high school or have earned a GED. Students are not required to have a minimum high school GPA and high school transcripts are not requested.
Students are excluded from traditional institutions for a number of reasons (financial, geographic, academic), all of which affect the completion rates at those institutions. Like their European cousins, many American institutions only admit the academic and financial elite. Students entering these universities not only have the requisite academic pedigree, few have risk factors identified as stumbling blocks to degree completion. The risk factors as identified by the Department of Education include the following:
14
At the University of Phoenix the majority of all students in the 2003 cohort studied and profiled below had risk factors 6 and 7. Further, increased risk factors are part of what defines non-traditional students. These increased risk factors  being parents, needing to enroll on a part-time basis, or not having a high school diploma  are some of the very reasons our students cite for enrolling in the University of Phoenix.
As shown in the graph below, University of Phoenix students with two risk factors completed at a rate of 55% as compared to students at institutions reported by the Department of Education who completed at a rate of 20%. As the risks increase in number, the completion rate for both sets of students decreases. The University of Phoenix students with three, four, and even five risk factors complete at higher rates than the national norm. Finally UPX students with six risk factors complete at a rate of 18%.
Number of Risk Factors vs. Bachelor Completion Rate
Note: Almost all UPX students in the 19982000 cohort studied had R6 and R7 risk factors because UPX required students at that time to be working and 23 years old.
22
 
Completion Rates
Using Department of Education-identified risk factors for student success, one might expect that the University of Phoenix would suffer low completion rates. In contrasting similar UPX and national cohorts, however, the results show that University of Phoenix students' rate of degree completion is comparable with national completion rates.
All primary providers of postsecondary educationin the United States must report data on enrollments, program completions, and graduation rates as well as other institutional information to the Department of Education for publication in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System or IPEDS.
15
The issue for institutions such as the University of Phoenix is that IPEDS data is calculated using "first-time students." These are students who start at one institution and complete their entire degree at that same institution. That student is an anomaly at University of Phoenix. The University of Phoenix began as a degree-completion institution; an institution that students sought out to finish what they had started; an institution to which students who had accumulated varying degrees of college credits came to complete their major course of study. Until the advent of the associate degree program at the University, students with zero transfer credits were a rarity. Therefore, the completion rates reported to IPEDS differ from the completion rates calculated by using the true population of the University, most of whom do not fall within the IPEDS definition.
Those rates are reported below for the associate, baccalaureate, and graduate programs at the University of Phoenix and in the following table for the same groups on a national level. As stated previously, the University of Phoenix rates are comparable to the National Completion Rates as reported by the Office of Economic Development.
Completion Rates
 
These results validate the Mission of the University as an inclusive institution dedicated to serving high-risk students. We provide access to these students who, as a result of their studies and learning, go on to graduate with knowledge and skill levels comparable to or better than standard measures and at a completion rate that is comparable to the norm in American higher education.
23
 
     
FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY
In today's highly politicized education environment, it is difficult to separate academic accountability from financial accountability. Institutions of higher learning vie not only for students but also for dollars. Taxpayers increasingly want to know where their money is going and how effective colleges are with their spending. The dramatic demographic shifts in the U.S. populationin which too few Americans participate and complete a higher education because they are under-funded and under-preparedmake it imperative that both the private for-profit and public non-profit sectors work to ensure that a college education is both available and affordable.
University of Phoenix, like many other open access institutions, is already wrestling with the meaning and impact of these demographic shifts. As we open our doors even wider to accommodate the growth we see in underserved students, it has been necessary to expand our investments into research and learning resources as well.
Reinvestment of Resources
The development of our online learning system, which began in 1989, has resulted in a scalable platform that allows us to make curriculum enhancements and changes in very short timeframes. In addition, as our assessment process helps us to identify where changes must be made in technology, curriculum or support systems, the University has learned to quickly identify and invest resources specifically targeted toward helping students achieve the learning outcomes. In this way we can "close the loop" on our assessment process in ways that affect the entire institution quickly and effectively.
For example, in 2000 the University began providing all course materials and textbooks, in electronic format via the Internet. This move is an essential and ongoing strategy to support students in the achievement of the Learning Goals by developing their abilities to access and organize electronic information, providing a means for collaboration, and introducing new learning tools that assist with critical thinking skills, communication, and professional competence. Key elements of this electronic resource system include ebooks, simulations, virtual organizations, writing and math support services, electronic portfolios, and a virtual library of more than 100 databases.
Currently, the University of Phoenix offers over 1,700 courses on campus and online. Almost all courses (1,683) are technologically enhanced, 255 of those courses use simulations, more than 400 courses direct students to the virtual organizations to solve problems, and approximately 100 courses utilize electronic portfolios. By providing electronic access to these materials, the University is in a position of being able to track usage and know if our students are accessing the learning tools and materials provided.

The University of Phoenix National Research Center
Reinvestment in our students' continued academic progress includes investments in research. In May 2008, the University announced the establishment of the University of Phoenix National Research Center (NRC) to drive continued significant and innovative research initiatives in teaching and learning among students, particularly non-traditional students, in higher education.
In support of its mission, the NRC will study and monitor developments in the field of higher education and how best to enhance the role played by University of Phoenix, particularly as it relates to innovative teaching and learning methods, educational technology, and issues of student achievement and retention, accountability, affordability, access and inclusion. The NRC will also work to enhance the University's research agenda, facilitating, supporting, and promoting faculty and student research. As a leader in adult higher education, as well as in technologically-enhanced delivery of education, University of Phoenix seeks to enrich the literature in these areas by developing a repository of information and research opportunities that will inform continued research in learning models, learning styles, and especially in dealing with the next generations of learners.
17
Affordability
Affordability goes hand-in-hand with accountability. To fulfill our social agenda, we must be able to provide education that benefits both our students and the communities in which they live.
Affordability for students at University of Phoenix takes into account both direct and indirect costs. Tuition and fees are maintained in the mid-range nationally for private universities. Textbooks and materials are dramatically lower than average, due to our technological innovations and scale, which have enabled us to pass significant savings on to our students.
Affordability of a college education must also take into account the indirect costs of time to degree completion and the ability of students to continue working while enrolled. The University's contemporary scheduling model plays a significant role in the affordability equation. That students can enroll sequentially and on a continuous basis, obtaining the courses they need almost any week of the year (rather than in standard semester terms), is no small factor in the success and the affordability for most UPX students.
25
 
Last but not least on the affordability and accountability spectrum is the public cost of a private sector education. We know what the cost of a public education is because it garners significant political and public debate both locally and nationally. What is not so well-known, however, is that a private sector institution such as the University of Phoenix actually pays back approximately $300 per student, when one calculates the difference in factors between tax-exempt status, tuition subsidies and various other forgone taxes. In an era marked by increasing tuition and decreasing state and federal funds for higher education, this becomes an essential element of financial accountability.
This information is encapsulated below with a set of related definitions and sources.

4  Student Loans  Interest Rate Subsidy
Federally guaranteed student loans are currently available at a discounted rate of 6.8 percent which equates to approximately a 7.3 annual percentage rate. A similar, unsecured loan would have an interest rate in the range of 10 to 10.5 percent. The difference amounts to a federal subsidy for higher education that was estimated to be three percent. The size of the subsidy was estimated with a six-step process.

6  Taxes Forgone on Endowments  Investment Income
7  Taxes Forgone on Additions to Endowments
Similarly contributions to the endowments of public and not-for-profit institutions avoid income taxes.
8  Taxes Forgone on Gifts, Grants, and Contracts
Gifts, grants, and contracts received by public and not-for-profit institutions have tax consequences for the donors. The income taxes avoided was estimated to be 30 percent. Capital appropriations for public institutions was assumed to be of no cost to the tax payers since one asset, cash, is being transferred into another asset of equal value such as a building or infrastructures.
9  Taxes Forgone on Corporate Profits
The Apollo Group paid approximately 9.9 percent of its total revenue in income taxes. A similar percentage was applied to public and non-for-profit schools to estimate the taxes these institutions avoided. Total revenue data was gathered from IPEDS Table 21.
10  Sales and Other Taxes Forgone
Similarly, Apollo Group company records estimated that .5 percent of total revenue was paid for sales and use taxes, personal property taxes, and real property taxes. This was an extremely conservative estimate because it was calculated only from supplier
30
 
invoices that itemized the amount of taxes paid. This percentage (.5 %) was applied to the total revenues of public and not-for-profit schools as an estimate of the additional taxes avoided.
11  Tax on Corporate Profits
Corporate taxes paid by for-profit institutions was estimated from total revenue (IPEDS Table 21 and Apollo Group 2004 Annual Report) at a rate of 9.9 percent.
12  Sales and Other Taxes
Sales and other taxes paid by for-profit institutions was estimated from total revenue (IPEDS Table 21 and Apollo Group 2004 Annual Report) at a rate of .5 percent.
13  Research Expense
The amount of money spent on research activities was drawn from IPEDS Table 23. .

EXHIBIT 99.1
Phoenix, Arizona, July 1, 2008  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or "the Company") today reported unaudited financial results for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2008.
Unaudited Third Quarter of Fiscal 2008 Results of Operations
Consolidated revenues for the three months ended May 31, 2008, totaled $835.2 million, which represents a 13.9% increase over the third quarter of fiscal 2007. Total Degreed Enrollment grew by 11.0% year-over-year to 345,300. The Company reported net income for the three months ended May 31, 2008, of $139.1 million, or $0.85 per share (163.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to net income of $131.4 million, or $0.75 per share (174.6 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended May 31, 2007. During the third quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company repurchased approximately 9.8 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average purchase price of approximately $46 for a total expenditure of $454 million. On June 27, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized an increase of the share repurchase program to an aggregate of $500 million.
Before giving effect to a special item of $1.6 million due to the securities class action verdict in the third quarter of fiscal 2008, and to special items related to the stock option investigation and restatement costs of $7.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, net income was $140.1 million, or $0.85 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2008, as compared to net income of $136.0 million, or $0.78 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2007.
Excluding share-based compensation expense of $14.4 million and the special item related to the securities class action verdict of $1.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2008, and share-based compensation expense of $8.9 million and stock option investigation and restatement costs of $7.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, net income would have been $148.8 million, or $0.91 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2008, as compared to net income of $141.4 million, or $0.81 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2007.

"We reported another quarter of solid revenue and enrollment growth, and importantly, we experienced improvement in the growth rate of New Degreed Enrollments as compared to last quarter," said Joe D'Amico, President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of Apollo Group. "While the overall cost to acquire a student has increased versus a year ago, we still believe that we are on the right track by bringing our marketing intelligence in-house with Aptimus and that the investments we're making today will lower our student acquisition costs over time and help us to better communicate our brands."
Greg Cappelli, Executive Vice President, Global Strategy and Assistant to the Executive Chairman added, "We continue to invest in new and existing areas including retention, new programs, resource centers and marketing, where we can leverage Apollo's infrastructure and experience. We are also pleased to announce that Insight Schools will start the 2008 school year with 11 schools in 10 states. The virtual high school market is strong and we are excited about their prospects. We recently announced the formation of Meritus University, a new Canadian degree-granting institution which will begin enrolling students this Fall. Lastly, during the quarter we closed Apollo Global's first transaction, the acquisition of Chilean-based UNIACC. Apollo Global has many solid opportunities to pursue abroad and their talented team is working diligently on these efforts."
Instructional costs and services increased by $26.6 million, or 8.3% to $347.6 million for the three months ended May 31, 2008, from $321.0 million in the three months ended May 31, 2007. As a percentage of net revenue, instructional costs and services declined to 41.6% versus 43.8% in the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of decreases as a percentage of net revenue, in bad debt expense and classroom lease expenses and depreciation. These decreases were partially offset by an increase, as a percentage of net revenue, in employee compensation and related expenses which is due, in part, to investments in Insight Schools and increases to the Company's compensation rates for academic and financial counselors.
As previously reported, during the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company reviewed the components of bad debt expense and identified certain items that should have been classified as discounts or refunds (reduction of tuition revenue) rather than bad debt expense. No reclassification was made for prior periods as the amounts were not material to prior period financial statements and had no effect on reported net income. Had the Company reclassified these items in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the amounts reported for net revenue, and bad debt expense would have been $5.0 million lower. On a comparable basis, bad debt expense, as a percentage of net revenue, decreased approximately 160 basis points from 4.0% in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 to 2.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2008. This decrease is primarily due to the continued focus on front-end collections as well as improvements in student retention rates. Retention and bad debt expense can vary seasonally, and as a result, bad debt expense as a percentage of net revenue may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.
Selling and promotional expenses increased by $40.7 million, or 25.0%, to $203.6 million for the three months ended May 31, 2008, from $162.9 million in the three months ended May 31, 2007. As a percentage of net revenue, selling and promotional expenses increased to 24.4%, from 22.2% in the prior year's third quarter. This was a result of an increase, as a percentage of net revenue, in enrollment counselors' compensation and related expenses, advertising and other
2
 
selling and promotional expenses. Included in other selling and promotional costs are expenses related to Aptimus which the Company acquired in the first quarter of 2008. The increase represents investments made to drive and support future growth of New Degreed Enrollments. Selling and promotional expenses per New Degreed Enrollment increased versus a year ago, and this trend may continue into the near future; however, the Company believes its efforts and investments will help it reduce these costs over the long-term.
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses for the three months ended May 31, 2008, increased by $14.8 million, or 32.1%, to $60.9 million, from $46.1 million in the three months ended May 31, 2007. As reported, G&A, as a percentage of net revenue, increased to 7.3% in the third quarter of 2008, versus 6.3% in the comparable period a year ago. Excluding special items in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, primarily related to the stock option investigation and restatement costs of $7.6 million, G&A expenses were $38.5 million, or 5.2% of net revenue, for the three months ended May 31, 2007. The increase to 7.3%, as a percentage of net revenue, in the third quarter of 2008, is mainly attributable to increases, as a percentage of net revenue, in salary and related payroll costs due to higher employee headcount, increased share-based compensation expense and higher legal fees.

Unaudited First Nine Months of Fiscal 2008 Results of Operations
Consolidated revenues for the nine months ended May 31, 2008, were $2.3 billion, a 14.9% increase over the first nine months of fiscal 2007. Average Degreed Enrollment grew by 11.0% for the nine months ended May 31, 2008 as compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2007.
The Company reported net income of $246.9 million, or $1.47 per share, (167.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), and $305.7 million, or $1.75 per share, (174.6 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the nine months ended May 31, 2008, and May 31, 2007, respectively.
Before giving effect to the securities class action litigation charge and interest of $170.0 million in the nine months ended May 31, 2008, and to special items related to the stock option investigation and restatement costs of $27.8 million in the nine months ended May 31, 2007, net income was $350.2 million, or $2.09 per share in the first nine months of fiscal 2008, as compared to net income of $322.5 million, or $1.85 per share in the first nine months of fiscal 2007.
Excluding total share-based compensation of $49.5 million as well as the securities litigation charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2008, and share-based compensation expense of $40.8 million and stock option investigation and restatement costs of $15.7 million (net of the $12.1 million stock option modification included in share-based compensation) in the first nine months of fiscal 2007, net income would have been $380.3 million, or $2.27 per share in the first nine months of fiscal 2008, as compared to net income of $339.8 million, or $1.95 per share in the first nine months of fiscal 2007.
(See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of May 31, 2008, the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash, totaled $302.5 million as compared to $392.7 million as of August 31, 2007. Also excluded from this balance at May 31, 2008, is $95.0 million of cash pledged as collateral for a bond posted by the Company in connection with the securities class action verdict announced during the fiscal second quarter.
Restricted cash and student deposits increased approximately $64.5 million and $58.7 million since August 31, 2008, respectively. These increases were primarily due to increased student enrollment.
At May 31, 2008, accounts receivable declined to $184.2 million from $190.9 million at August 31, 2007, resulting in days sales outstanding ("DSO") declining to 26 days for the third quarter as compared to 36 days in the third quarter of 2007, and from 38 days at August 31, 2007. The decrease in DSO is primarily due to improvements in processing time for the receipt of student financial aid, the write-off of approximately $28.4 million in previously reserved uncollectible accounts receivable during the quarter and seasonality. As a result of seasonality, DSO may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.
5
 
Goodwill increased by $36.4 million to $66.0 million at May 31, 2008, from $29.6 million at August 31, 2007, primarily due to the acquisition of Aptimus, Inc. in the first quarter of 2008.
Intangible assets, net, increased by $19.5 million to $21.7 million at May 31, 2008, from $2.2 million at August 31, 2007, primarily due to the acquisition of Aptimus, Inc. in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 and Apollo Global's acquisition of UNIACC in the third quarter of fiscal 2008.
Deferred tax assets increased by $77.4 million to $208.4 million at May 31, 2008, from $131.0 million at August 31, 2007, mainly due to the accounting for the tax effects of the securities litigation charge.
Long-term liabilities (including current portion) increased by $240.8 million to $333.8 million at May 31, 2008, from $93.0 million at August 31, 2007, primarily due to the securities litigation charge and the reclassification from income taxes payable of approximately $53.0 million related to the adoption of FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions.
Deferred revenue at May 31, 2008, increased to $206.0 million from $167.3 million at August 31, 2007, and increased from $150.0 million at May 31, 2007. The increase from the prior year quarter is principally due to increased student enrollment.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
     (c) On July 7, 2008, our Board of Directors appointed Charles "Chas" B. Edelstein as Chief Executive Officer and a Director, effective August 26, 2008 (the "Commencement Date").
     Mr. Edelstein, who is 48 years old, has been employed by Credit Suisse since 1987, and has been a Managing Director since 1998. He has been the head of the Global Services Group within the Investment Banking Division of Credit Suisse since founding the Group more than ten years ago. His focus has been on providing advisory services regarding acquisitions, dispositions and capital raising transactions. We have utilized Credit Suisse for these types of advisory services in respect of potential acquisition and capital raising transactions from time to time in the past, and expect to do so in the future.
     In connection with his appointment as CEO, we entered into an Employment Agreement with Mr. Edelstein dated July 7, 2008. A copy of the Employment Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K and the summary below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement. Under the Employment Agreement, which has an initial term of four years from his start date (expected to be August 26, 2008), Mr. Edelstein will be entitled to the following compensation:
      $200,000 sign-on bonus;
 - 
      Base salary of $600,000;
 - 
      Target annual performance bonus amount at least equal to base salary, commencing with the fiscal year ending August 31, 2009;
 - 
      Stock option to purchase 1,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock to be granted on Mr. Edelstein's start date with an exercise price equal to the closing market price on that date. The option will have a maximum term of six years and will vest equally over four years;
 - 
      Restricted stock unit award to be made on the third business day following the public release of our financial results for our fiscal year ending August 31, 2008 (the "Public Release Award Date") or, if Mr. Edelstein's start date occurs after August 31, 2008, then on such start date. The number of shares of our Class A common stock subject to such award will be determined by dividing (i) the value (based on the closing market price on his start date) of up to 99,298 unvested shares of Credit Suisse Group common stock subject to his outstanding stock-based awards from Credit Suisse Group (the "CSG Equity Award") that are actually forfeited Mr. Edelstein as a result of his commencement of employment with us by (ii) the closing market price of our Class A common stock on such start date. In addition, to the extent Mr. Edelstein does not otherwise forfeit the shares subject to his CSG Equity Award, he will receive a restricted stock award on the Public Release Award Date (or start date, if after August 31, 2008) covering shares of our Class A common stock with a closing market price on that date equal to 25% of the value of the non-forfeited shares. Such restricted stock unit award or awards will vest only upon our attainment of a pre-established net book income goal for our fiscal year ending August 31, 2009. Additionally, vesting will be subject to his continued employment with us as follows: (i) 40% upon each of the first and second anniversaries of his start date and (ii) the remaining 20% upon the third anniversary of such start date; and
 - 
      An additional restricted stock unit award covering 8,000 shares of our Class A common stock to be made at the same time as the foregoing restricted stock award or awards. Such award will vest upon his continued employment with us as follows: (i) 40% upon each of the first and second anniversaries of his start date and (ii) the remaining 20% upon the third anniversary of such start date.
 - 
Table of Contents
     In addition, the Employment Agreement provides for the following severance payments to Mr. Edelstein if he terminates his employment for good reason (as defined in the Employment Agreement), he terminates his employment for any reason six months following a change of control (as defined in our 2000 Stock Incentive Plan), his employment is terminated by us without cause or we give notice of nonrenewal of his Employment Agreement:
      a payment equal to 200% of base salary and 200% of his average annual bonuses for the preceding three years, payable over a one year period;
 - 
      100% vesting of the restricted stock grants made pursuant to the Employment Agreement;
 - 
      accelerated vesting of at least 50% of the unvested portion of the stock option grant made pursuant to the Employment Agreement, subject to upward adjustment depending on the date of termination.
 - 
Such severance benefits will be conditioned upon Mr. Edelstein's delivery of a general release and his compliance with certain non-competition and non-solicitation covenants.
     (d) As discussed in Item 5.02(c) above, our Board of Directors appointed Mr. Edelstein to fill a vacancy on our board, effective August 26, 2008. See the discussion above regarding Mr. Edelstein's compensation and transactions involving his current employer, Credit Suisse.

Section 409A
     (a) It is the intent of the parties that the provisions of this Agreement comply with all applicable requirements of Code Section 409A.

If any federal legislation is enacted during the term of this Agreement which imposes a dollar limit on deferred compensation, then the Executive will co-operate with the Company in restructuring any items of compensation under this Agreement that are deemed to be deferred compensation subject to such limitation; provided such restructuring shall not reduce the dollar amount of any such item or adversely affect the vesting provisions applicable to such item or otherwise reduce the present value of that item.

The specified employees subject to such a delayed commencement date shall be identified on December 31 of each calendar year.

If the period of the leave exceeds six (6) months (or twenty-nine (29) months in the event of disability as indicated above) and the Executive is not provided with a right to reemployment by either statute or contract, then the Executive will be deemed to have Separated from Service on the first day immediately following the expiration of the applicable six (6)-month or twenty-nine (29)-month period.

The amount of the 409A Gross-Up Payment shall be calculated, by an Accounting Firm mutually agreeable to the Company and the Executive, within ten (10) business days after it is first determined that the Executive is subject to the Section 409A Penalty Tax, and the 409A Gross-Up Payment so calculated shall be paid to or on behalf of the Executive within five (5) business days after the completion of such determination or (if later) at the time the related Section 409A Penalty Tax is remitted to the appropriate tax authorities.

The Company shall make the supplemental 409A Gross-Up payment to the Executive within five (5) business days following the completion of the applicable calculations or (if later) at the time such excess Section 409A Penalty Tax liability is remitted to the appropriate tax authorities. In the event that the Executive's actual Section 409A Penalty Tax liability is determined by a Final Determination to be less than the Section 409A Penalty Tax liability taken into account for purposes of the 409A Gross-Up Payment initially made to the Executive pursuant to the provisions of this Section 14(c), then the Executive shall refund to the Company, promptly upon receipt, any federal or state tax refund attributable to the overpayment of his Section 409A Penalty Tax.
     15. . Within fourteen (14) calendar days after the date this Agreement becomes effective, the Company will reimburse the Executive for his legal fees incurred in connection with the Agreement's preparation and negotiation, up to a maximum dollar amount of $40,000.00.

In addition to any rights the Executive may have under such D&O Insurance, applicable law, or the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and except as may be prohibited by applicable law, the Company agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold the Executive harmless from and against any and all claims and/or liability arising from, as a result of, or in connection with the Executive's employment by the Company or any outside appointments and offices held at the Company's request, except to the extent such claims or liability are fully and finally adjudged by a court, after the expiration or exhaustion of permitted appeals, to be attributable to the Executive's gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Indemnification
     17. . The Executive expressly agrees that the covenants set forth in Sections 9 and 10 of this Agreement are reasonable and necessary to protect the Company and its legitimate business interests, and to prevent the unauthorized dissemination of Proprietary Information to competitors of the Company. The Executive also agrees that the Company will be irreparably harmed and that damages alone cannot adequately compensate the Company if there is a violation of Section 9 or 10 of this Agreement by the Executive, and that injunctive relief against the Executive is essential for the protection of the Company. Therefore, in the event of any such breach, it is agreed that, in addition to any other remedies available, the Company shall be entitled as a matter of right to injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction, plus attorneys' fees actually incurred for the securing of such relief.
Injunctive Relief
     18. . The provisions of Sections 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 25 and 26 will survive any termination of this Agreement.

The arbitration shall be conducted in Chicago, Illinois and in accordance with the American Arbitration Association ("") Employment Arbitration Rules in effect at the time such arbitration is properly initiated. To the extent that any of the AAA rules or anything in the Agreement conflicts with any arbitration procedures required by applicable law, the arbitration procedures required by applicable law shall govern. The costs of the arbitration, including administrative fees and fees charged by the arbitrator, will be borne by the Company. Each party will bear its or his own travel expenses and attorneys' fees: provided, however that the arbitrator (i) shall award attorneys' fees to the Executive with respect to any claim for breach of this Agreement on which he is the prevailing party and may award attorneys' fees to the Executive as otherwise allowed by law and (ii) shall award attorneys' fees to the Company with respect to any claim brought under Section 17 on which it is the prevailing party and may award attorneys' fees to the Company with respect to any other claim on which it is the prevailing party and it is determined by the arbitrator that such claim by the Executive was frivolous in that it presented no colorable arguments for recovery; but the maximum amount of attorneys' fees that may be awarded to the Company other than with respect to any claim brought under Section 17 shall not exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000). In any situation in which emergency injunctive relief may be necessary, either party may seek such relief from a court until such time as the arbitrator is able to address the matter covered by this Section 21. Both parties agree that the state and federal courts located in Chicago, Illinois, will be the sole venue for any such action involving emergency injunctive relief, and the parties submit to personal jurisdiction in these courts for this purpose. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

          (b) The only claims that Executive is not waiving and releasing under this Agreement are claims he may have for (1) unemployment, state disability, worker's compensation, and/or paid family leave insurance benefits pursuant to the terms of applicable state law; (2) continuation of existing participation in Company-sponsored group health benefit plans under the federal law known as "COBRA" and/or under an applicable state law counterpart(s); (3) any benefits entitlements that are vested and unpaid as of his termination date pursuant to the terms of a Company-sponsored benefit plan; (4) any benefits to which he is entitled pursuant to Section 8 of the Employment Agreement or his rights to indemnification pursuant to Section 16 of the Employment Agreement, (5) violation of any federal state or local statutory and/or public policy right or entitlement that, by applicable law, is not waivable; and (6) any wrongful act or omission occurring after the date he executes this Agreement. In addition, nothing in this Agreement prevents or prohibits Executive from filing a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or any other government agency that is responsible for enforcing a law on behalf of the government and deems such claims not waivable. However, because Executive is
 
hereby waiving and releasing all claims "for monetary damages and any other form of personal relief" (per Section 3(a) above), he may only seek and receive non-personal forms of relief from the EEOC and similar government agencies.
          (c) Executive represents that he has not filed any complaints, charges, claims, grievances, or lawsuits against the Company and/or any related persons with any local, state or federal agency or court, or with any other forum.
          (d) Executive acknowledges that he may discover facts different from or in addition to those he now knows or believes to be true with respect to the claims, demands, causes of action, obligations, damages, and liabilities of any nature whatsoever that are the subject of this Agreement, and he expressly agrees to assume the risk of the possible discovery of additional or different facts, and agrees that this Agreement shall be and remain in effect in all respects regardless of such additional or different facts. Executive expressly acknowledges that this Agreement is intended to include, and does include in its effect, without limitation, all claims which Executive does not know or suspect to exist in his favor against the Company and/or any related persons at the moment of execution thereof, and that this Agreement expressly contemplates extinguishing all such claims.
          (e) Executive understands and agrees that the Company has no obligation to provide him with any severance benefits under the Employment Agreement unless he executes this Agreement. Executive also understands that he has received or will receive, regardless of the execution of this Agreement, all wages owed to him, together with any accrued but unpaid vacation pay, less applicable withholdings and deductions, earned through the Termination Date.
          (f) This Agreement is binding on Executive, his heirs, legal representatives and assigns.
     3.  This Agreement and the Employment Agreement constitute the entire understanding and agreement between Executive and the Company in connection with the matters described, and replaces and cancels all previous agreements and commitments, whether spoken or written, with respect to such matters. Nothing in this Agreement supersedes or replaces any of Executive's obligations under his Employment Agreement that survive termination, including, but not limited to (i) his (and the Company's) agreement to arbitrate disputes, (ii) his restrictive covenants under Section 10 of the Employment Agreement and (iii) his obligations under Section 9 of the Employment Agreement, his existing Proprietary Information Inventions Agreement with the Company and any other obligations not to use or disclose Company confidential and/or proprietary information.
Entire Agreement.
     4.  No oral agreement, statement, promise, commitment or representation shall alter or terminate the provisions of this Agreement. This Agreement cannot be changed or modified except by written agreement signed by Executive and authorized representatives of the Company.
Modification in Writing.

Governing Law; Jurisdiction.
     6.  Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.
Severability.
 
     7.  This Agreement does not constitute an admission of any unlawful discriminatory acts or liability of any kind by the Company or anyone acting under their supervision or on their behalf. This Agreement may not be used or introduced as evidence in any legal proceeding, except to enforce or challenge its terms.
No Admission of Liability.

Acknowledgements
          (a) has read and understands all of the terms of this Agreement and is not relying on any representations or statements, written or oral, not set forth in this Agreement;

Exhibit 99.1
Phoenix, Arizona, August 5, 2008  Apollo Global, Inc., a consolidated subsidiary of Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or the "Company") announced it has purchased a majority stake in Universidad Latinoamericana S.C. ("ULA"), an accredited, private university based in Mexico City, from Carlyle Mexico Partners.
"We are pleased to invest in an institution such as ULA with its 32-year history and solid reputation," stated Greg Cappelli, Chairman of Apollo Global. "This commitment reflects our desire to provide high-quality education to students throughout Mexico and the region. We have been working to identify opportunities that will create value for Apollo Group shareholders, and we believe ULA, coupled with Mexico's strong enrollment trends and growing economy, is an excellent fit."
Founded in 1975, ULA is renowned for its dentistry, medicine and communications programs accredited by the Ministry of Public Education (Secretara de Educacin Publica, SEP) in Mexico. ULA carries authorization from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (Universidad Nacional Autnoma de Mxico, UNAM) for its high school and undergraduate psychology and law programs. With four campuses throughout Mexico, including two in Mexico City, one in Tlalnepantla de Baz, and a fourth in the city of Cuernavaca, ULA offers 27 degree programs and has more than 4,000 students.
Alberto Sancho, Rector of ULA, stated, "We are proud to join the prestigious family of Apollo institutions, with which we share the same ideals of academic excellence and high-level service to our students. Apollo is now our long-term strategic partner. Leveraging our excellent faculty with Apollo's world-class methods for curriculum development, we will offer our students an advanced educational experience, preparing them for Mexico's growing economy."
Prior to Apollo Global's purchase of a majority stake, ULA was a portfolio company of Carlyle Mexico Partners, a private equity fund managed by The Carlyle Group. Carlyle Mexico Partners will continue to own a 35% equity stake in ULA and have representation on its Board of Directors.
Joaquin Avila, Managing Director and Head of the Carlyle Mexico team, said, "ULA has a bright future. We have been working to grow the university for the past two years and a partnership with Apollo Group, a leader in the sector, affirms and furthers these efforts. In this way, ULA solidly makes its entrance into a globally connected educational community, creating an even more attractive offering for Mexican students. We will continue to actively participate in ULA's growth as part of our commitment to ULA and Mexico. ULA is a great example
of the
1
 
valuable benefits that can be achieved by a Mexican institution partnering with a private equity group such as Carlyle Mexico Partners."
Apollo Global purchased a 65% stake in ULA based on an implied enterprise value of $47 million.
Mexico offers an attractive market opportunity with an estimated 2.5 million post-secondary students, as well as the second largest population and the highest per capita GDP in Latin America. Participation rates in private education are growing faster than in the public sector. Today, approximately 32% of higher-education students are enrolled in private universities.

Apollo Group, Inc.
News Release
PHOENIX, AZ, August 5, 2008  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or the "Company") applauded yesterday's District Court decision in which Judge James A. Teilborg overturned the previous verdict that had been rendered in the plaintiffs' favor in the securities litigation arising out of the 2003 program review by the Department of Education. Notably, the Court found that an analyst's report on which the plaintiffs' case heavily relied was not a corrective disclosure.
Apollo Group called the ruling a vindication for its students, alumni, employees and shareholders. P. Robert Moya, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary for Apollo Group, Inc., said, "It has always been Apollo Group's position that the plaintiffs in the case did not suffer any damages arising from the disclosure of the initial government report and its unsubstantiated allegations, and we are pleased that the Court has agreed."
Wayne Smith, Partner with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and lead counsel for Apollo Group, stated, "The Court's decision validates the arguments made by Apollo Group since the beginning of this case, namely, that the ultimate disclosure of the initial report's contents caused no significant movement in Apollo's stock price."

Litigation Background
This case, was a consolidated securities class action brought by the Policemen's Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago. It stemmed from allegations about the non-disclosure of an initial government report about the manner in which Apollo subsidiary University of Phoenix compensated its enrollment counselors. The report's allegations, which were first raised in a False Claims Act lawsuit filed in 2003 by two employees and then repeated with striking similarity in the initial government report at issue, have been largely discredited in recent years.
Apollo Group Inc. Securities Litigation,
The case was tried in Federal District Court in Arizona beginning November 14, 2007. The jury found in favor of the plaintiffs on January 16, 2008 and the plaintiff class was awarded damages of up to $5.55 per share. Today's ruling overturns the jury verdict.

(d) Exhibits.
The following exhibit is furnished herewith:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
Phoenix, Arizona, October 28, 2008  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or "the Company") today reported financial results for the three months and fiscal year ended August 31, 2008. During the fourth quarter, Charles "Chas" B. Edelstein joined the Company as Chief Executive Officer of Apollo Group. Subsequent to the year-end, Joseph L. D'Amico was appointed President of Apollo Group, in addition to being the Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
Chas Edelstein commented, "I am delighted to be a part of the successful and talented team at Apollo Group. In my short time here I have validated my prior belief that this is a world-class organization with tremendous opportunity in its future. I look forward to working with the team as we strengthen and grow our business both domestically and internationally."
Unaudited Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2008 Results of Operations
Consolidated revenues for the three months ended August 31, 2008, totaled $831.4 million, which represents a 16.5% increase over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Total Degreed Enrollment grew by 15.4% year-over-year to 362,100. The Company reported net income for the three months ended August 31, 2008, of $229.6 million, or $1.43 per share (160.1 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to net income of $103.2 million, or $0.60 per share (171.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended August 31, 2007.
During the fourth quarter, the Company reversed its previously recorded charge for estimated damages of $170 million associated with the judgment in a securities class action lawsuit because the Ninth Circuit vacated the earlier judgment.
Before giving effect to this reversal, and to a $9.5 million gain (including interest) during the fourth quarter of 2008 from a third party's forfeiture of an escrow deposit due to the expiration of their option to purchase the Company's headquarters building, and to restatement costs of $6.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, net income increased 12.5% to $120.5 million, or $0.75 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, as compared to net income of $107.1 million, or $0.62 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.
 
Excluding share-based compensation expense of $4.1 million and $13.2 million in the fourth quarters of fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively, as well as the special items described above, net income would have been $123.0 million, or $0.77 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, as compared to net income of $115.1 million, or $0.67 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.
(See the reconciliation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
"The fourth quarter concluded a transformative and rewarding year for Apollo Group and its stakeholders, as we made solid financial, operational and organizational strides. In fiscal 2008, we grew our revenue by approximately 15% over the prior year, and importantly, for the first time in several years, meaningfully grew earnings per share, while continuing to produce significant cash flow," said Joseph L. D'Amico. "In the fourth quarter we again reported solid revenue and enrollment growth, and we experienced an increase in the year-over-year growth rate of New Degreed Enrollments for the second quarter in a row. During the fourth quarter we had Degreed Enrollment of 362,100 students, having started a record 83,100 students during the quarter. And, while the overall cost to acquire a student is still higher than we would like, we continue to work diligently and are pleased with the efforts we have in process."
Greg Cappelli, Executive Vice President, Global Strategy and Assistant to the Executive Chairman added, "During the year, we made significant investments in our core University of Phoenix business, which continues to generate the highest returns for our shareholders. We also invested in several new growth opportunities which we believe will generate incremental shareholder value over time. During the fourth quarter, Apollo Global, which was formed a year ago, completed its second acquisition, the purchase of a majority stake in Universidad Latinoamericana, S.C. ("ULA"), a private university based in Mexico City. Separately, Insight Schools, our online high school provider, started the 2008 school year with 11 schools in 10 states, and finally, Meritus, our new Canadian university, had its ribbon cutting ceremony last month and recently began enrolling its first cohort of students. We are pleased with the progress we made this year toward our goal of being a leading global institution."
Instructional costs and services increased by $35.1 million, or 10.7% to $362.3 million for the three months ended August 31, 2008, from $327.2 million in the three months ended August 31, 2007. As a percentage of net revenue, instructional costs and services declined to 43.6% versus 45.8% in the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of decreases as a percentage of net revenue, in bad debt expense, classroom lease expenses and depreciation and other instructional costs and services. These decreases were partially offset by an increase, as a percentage of net revenue, in employee compensation and related expenses which is due, in part, to investments in Insight Schools and Apollo Global, as well as increases in the Company's compensation rates for academic and financial counselors.
As previously reported, during the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company reviewed the components of bad debt expense and identified certain items that should have been classified as discounts or refunds (reduction of tuition revenue) rather than bad debt expense. No reclassification was made for prior periods as the amounts were not material to prior period
 
financial statements and had no effect on reported net income. Had the Company reclassified these items in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the amounts reported for net revenue and bad debt expense would have been $6.5 million lower. On a comparable basis, bad debt expense, as a percentage of net revenue, decreased approximately 140 basis points from 4.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 to 3.0% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. This decrease is primarily due to the continued focus on front-end collections as well as improvements in student retention rates.
Selling and promotional expenses increased by $49.3 million, or 28.4%, to $223.1 million for the three months ended August 31, 2008, from $173.8 million in the three months ended August 31, 2007. As a percentage of net revenue, selling and promotional expenses increased 250 basis points to 26.8%, from 24.3% in the prior year's fourth quarter. This was a result of an increase, as a percentage of net revenue, in enrollment counselors' compensation and related expenses, advertising and other selling and promotional expenses which includes expenses related to Aptimus which the Company acquired in the first quarter of 2008. The Company continues to invest in marketing to build greater brand identity as well as to drive and support future enrollment growth. As a result, selling and promotional expenses may continue to increase in the near-term; however, the Company believes its efforts and investments will help it reduce these costs over the long-term.
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses for the three months ended August 31, 2008, declined by $14.3 million, or 23.0%, to $48.0 million, from $62.3 million in the three months ended August 31, 2007. As reported, G&A, as a percentage of net revenue, decreased to 5.8% in the fourth quarter of 2008, versus 8.7% in the comparable period a year ago. Excluding special items in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, primarily related to the stock option investigation and restatement costs of $6.4 million, G&A expenses were $55.9 million, or 7.8% of net revenue, for the three months ended August 31, 2007. The 200 basis point decline to 5.8%, as a percentage of net revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2008, is mainly attributable to a decrease in share-based compensation expense, due primarily to the forfeiture of unvested options related to the departure of the former President of Apollo Group in June 2008.
Financial and Operating Metrics
Below are Apollo Group's unaudited financial data and operating metrics for fiscal 2008.
 
 
 
2008 Fiscal Year-End Results of Operations
Consolidated revenues for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2008, were $3.1 billion, a 15.3% increase over fiscal 2007. Average quarterly Degreed Enrollment grew by 12.1% for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007.
The Company reported net income of $476.5 million, or $2.87 per share, (165.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), and $408.8 million, or $2.35 per share, (173.6 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively. During fiscal 2008, the Company repurchased approximately 9.8 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average purchase price of approximately $46 for a total expenditure of $454 million. The Company currently has an outstanding share repurchase authorization of up to $500 million.
Before giving effect to a $9.5 million gain (including interest) from a third party's forfeiture of an escrow deposit due to the expiration of their option to purchase the Company's headquarters building, in fiscal 2008, and to special items related to the stock option investigation and restatement costs of $33.8 million in fiscal 2007, net income increased 9.6% to $470.7 million, or $2.84 per share in fiscal 2008, as compared to net income of $429.3 million, or $2.47 per share in fiscal 2007.
Excluding total share-based compensation of $53.6 million and the $9.5 million gain, described above, in fiscal 2008, and share-based compensation expense of $54.0 million and stock option investigation and restatement costs of $21.7 million (net of the $12.1 million stock option modification included in share-based compensation) in fiscal 2007, net income would have been $503.3 million, or $3.03 per share in fiscal 2008, as compared to net income of $454.8 million, or $2.62 per share in fiscal 2007.
(See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of August 31, 2008, the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash, totaled $511.5 million as compared to $392.7 million as of August 31, 2007. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the $95.0 million appeal bond posted in February 2008 was released when the District Court vacated the earlier judgment in the Company's securities class action lawsuit and entered judgment in favor of Apollo Group. As a result, the $95.0 million was removed from restricted cash and is included in cash and cash equivalents.
Restricted cash and student deposits increased by approximately $87.7 million and $85.3 million since August 31, 2007, respectively. These increases were primarily due to increased student enrollment and to increases in Title IV funds available to students.
At August 31, 2008, accounts receivable increased to $221.9 million from $190.9 million at August 31, 2007. The increase includes a combined $29.9 million in student account receivables at Universidad de Artes, Ciencias y Comunicacin ("UNIACC") and ULA. Excluding this amount and the associated revenue, the Company's days sales outstanding ("DSO") declined to
 
29 days for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 as compared to 38 days for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. The decrease in DSO is primarily due to improvements in processing time for the receipt of student financial aid and the write-off of approximately $125.7 million in previously reserved uncollectible accounts receivable during the year.
Goodwill increased by $56.3 million to $86.0 million at August 31, 2008, from $29.6 million at August 31, 2007, and intangible assets, net, increased by $20.9 million to $23.1 million at August 31, 2008, from $2.2 million at August 31, 2007. The increases in both accounts were primarily due to the acquisition of Aptimus, Inc. in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, and Apollo Global's acquisitions of UNIACC and ULA during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2008, respectively.
Long-term liabilities (including the current portion) increased by $100.0 million to $193.0 million at August 31, 2008, from $93.0 million at August 31, 2007, primarily due to the reclassification from income taxes payable of approximately $53.0 million related to the adoption of FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions, as well as additional capital lease obligations and other borrowings associated with Apollo Global's acquisitions.
Total deferred revenue at August 31, 2008, increased to $231.3 million from $167.3 million at August 31, 2007. The increase is principally due to increased student enrollment.

(e) On December 12, 2008, Apollo Group, Inc. (the "Company") entered into amendments to the following employment agreements with three named executive officers of the Company:
The amendment to each employment agreement will become effective as of January 1, 2009 and will effect the following principal changes to each agreement:
          (i) The various compensation provisions in effect for the named executive officer under his employment agreement will be restructured so as to comply with the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the Treasury Regulations issued thereunder.
          (ii) The bonus component of the severance benefit formula that would become applicable upon an involuntary termination of the named executive officer's employment by the Company without cause or upon his resignation for good reason will be modified so that the formula will no longer be tied to a multiple (two times for Messrs. D'Amico and Cappelli and one time for Mr. Moya) of his target bonus for the year in which such termination or resignation occurs. Instead, the bonus component of the formula will be tied to the applicable multiple of the average of the actual bonuses earned by the named executive officer for the three (or fewer) fiscal years preceding the fiscal year in which such termination or resignation occurs.
In addition, the Company entered into amended and restated restricted stock unit issuance agreements with each of the three named executive officers for the purpose of bringing the prior agreements into documentary compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, effective January 1, 2009.

The following exhibit is furnished herewith:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
Phoenix, Arizona, January 8, 2009  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or "the Company") today reported financial results for the three months ended November 30, 2008.
Consolidated revenues for the three months ended November 30, 2008, totaled $971.0 million, which represents a 24.4% increase over the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Total Degreed Enrollment in the first quarter grew by 18.4% year-over-year to 384,900. The Company reported net income for the three months ended November 30, 2008, of $180.4 million, or $1.12 per share (160.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to net income of $139.9 million, or $0.83 per share (169.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended November 30, 2007.
Unaudited First Quarter of Fiscal 2009 Results of Operations
 
"Our year-end momentum carried into the first quarter of fiscal 2009 as we continue to benefit from the significant investments we have made over the past several years and we are very pleased with our results," said Chas Edelstein, Chief Executive Officer of Apollo Group. "We reported year-over-year operating income growth of approximately 40% on 24% revenue growth, and Degreed Enrollment reached a record 384,900 students during the quarter. While we cannot quantify the significance of the current economy on our growth, we believe we are experiencing a positive impact, and we continue to generate meaningful cash flow. Additionally, our growth is directly impacted by the efforts of our thousands of employees and faculty who are dedicated to providing great academic service and support to our students."
Mr. Edelstein continued, "Our flagship University of Phoenix contributed significantly to our results, and we are very pleased with the continued growth in bachelor degree seeking students, which is an important market for us. In the first quarter, new degreed enrollment of bachelor students grew close to 20% over the prior year. We are making progress in our other investment areas as well including our online high school, Insight Schools and Apollo Global."

In conclusion, Mr. Edelstein stated, "We remain optimistic about Apollo Group's future. We have a strong balance sheet as well as solid operational and academic teams, putting us in a good position to further execute on our strategy and generate long-term shareholder value."
Instructional costs and services increased by $44.0 million, or 13.2% to $377.3 million for the three months ended November 30, 2008, from $333.3 million in the three months ended November 30, 2007. As a percentage of net revenue, instructional costs and services declined 380 basis points to 38.9% versus 42.7% in the prior year quarter. A predominant contributor to the decline was savings from lower negotiated contract costs from third-party vendors, particularly in financial aid processing where costs declined 140 basis points as a percentage of net revenue. Additionally, the Company continues to benefit from lower classroom lease expenses and depreciation as a percentage of net revenue. Bad debt expense declined 60 basis points as a percentage of net revenue, primarily due to a continued focus on front end collection efforts and improved student retention rates. As compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, bad debt expense increased 60 basis points, as a percentage of net revenue, due, in part, to the risk of collecting aged receivables given the current economic environment.
Selling and promotional expenses increased by $51.7 million, or 29.2%, to $228.6 million for the three months ended November 30, 2008, from $176.9 million in the three months ended November 30, 2007. As a percentage of net revenue, selling and promotional expenses increased 90 basis points to 23.5%, from 22.6% in the prior year's first quarter. This was mainly a result of an 80 basis point increase in other selling and promotional expenses principally driven by increases in the Company's corporate marketing function, including additional employees. The Company continues to invest in marketing to build greater brand identity as well as to drive and support future enrollment growth.
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses for the three months ended November 30, 2008, increased by $6.9 million, or 13.5%, to $58.2 million, from $51.3 million in the three months ended November 30, 2007. G&A, as a percentage of net revenue, decreased to 6.0% in the first quarter of 2009, versus 6.6% in the comparable period a year ago. The 60 basis point decline is mainly attributable to a decrease in legal costs, share-based compensation expense, and other G&A expense, somewhat offset by higher employee compensation expense, as a percentage of net revenue.
Financial and Operating Metrics

Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of November 30, 2008, the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash, totaled $821.3 million as compared to $511.5 million as of August 31, 2008. Restricted cash and student deposits increased by approximately $58.6 million and $42.1 million since August 31, 2008, respectively. These increases were primarily due to increased student enrollment and to increases in Title IV funds available to students.
At November 30, 2008, accounts receivable declined to $200.7 million from $221.9 million at August 31, 2008. Excluding accounts receivable and the associated revenue for Apollo Global, the Company's days sales outstanding ("DSO") declined to 26 days at November 30, 2008 as compared to 35 days at November 30, 2007, and 29 days at August 31, 2008. The decrease in DSO is primarily due to improvements in processing time for the receipt of student financial aid.
Total deferred revenue at November 30, 2008, decreased to $217.7 million from $231.3 million at August 31, 2008. The decrease is seasonal in nature and consistent with the Company's enrollment growth.

Exhibit 99.1
Phoenix, Arizona, March 31, 2009  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or "the Company") today reported financial results for the three and six months ended February 28, 2009.
Unaudited Second Quarter of Fiscal 2009 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the three months ended February 28, 2009, totaled $876.1 million, which represents a 26.3% increase over the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Contributing to the growth was a 20.4% year-over-year increase in University of Phoenix total Degreed Enrollment to 397,700. The Company reported net income for the three months ended February 28, 2009, of $125.3 million, or $0.77 per share (162.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to a net loss of $32.0 million, or $0.19 per share (168.0 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended February 29, 2008. Included in the fiscal 2008 results is a pre-tax charge of $168.4 million which represented an accrual for estimated damages stemming from an adverse jury verdict in a securities class action lawsuit. This charge was reversed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, when the trial court vacated the judgment. Before giving effect to the litigation charge, net income was $70.3 million or $0.41 per share (170.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
"We are pleased with the growth in revenue and enrollments in our second quarter and we believe we are continuing to benefit from investments we are making in key academic and operational areas," said Chas Edelstein, Chief Executive Officer of Apollo Group. "University of Phoenix again contributed significantly to our results, driven by 20% Degreed Enrollment growth, bringing the total during the quarter to nearly 400,000 students. This growth would not be possible without the incredible commitment of our faculty and staff who work tirelessly to provide a high level of academic quality in the classroom and outstanding support to our students."
Instructional costs and services increased by $45.6 million, or 13.9% to $373.3 million for the three months ended February 28, 2009, from $327.7 million in the three months ended February 29, 2008. As a percentage of net revenue, instructional costs and services declined 460 basis
1
 
points to 42.6% versus 47.2% in the prior year quarter. The improvement was predominantly due to University of Phoenix continuing to leverage its fixed costs, such as certain employee wages, classroom space and depreciation expense. This was partially offset by greater expenses, as a percentage of net revenue, at Apollo Global and Insight Schools associated with their start-up and development and other infrastructure and support costs. University of Phoenix benefited from economies of scale associated with its 26.0% increase in net revenue due to certain costs being relatively fixed including certain wages, classroom space and depreciation. Additionally, University of Phoenix has grown its variable headcount at a slower rate than the increase in net revenue. The Company also benefited from savings due to lower negotiated contract costs in financial aid processing. These gains were offset somewhat by a 30 basis point increase, as a percentage of net revenue, in bad debt expense versus the second quarter of fiscal 2008. As compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2009, bad debt expense increased 50 basis points, as a percentage of net revenue. The increases are primarily due to the increased risk of collecting aged receivables and lower collection rates on those receivables given the current economic downturn.
Selling and promotional expenses increased by $24.0 million, or 11.9%, to $225.7 million for the three months ended February 28, 2009, from $201.7 million in the three months ended February 29, 2008. As a percentage of net revenue, selling and promotional expenses declined 330 basis points to 25.8%, from 29.1% in the prior year's second quarter. This was mainly a result of improvement at University of Phoenix where enrollment counselor effectiveness continues to improve due, in part, to increased tenure of enrollment counselors. Additionally, investments in marketing resulted in more effective and efficient advertising at University of Phoenix. The Company continues to invest in marketing to build greater brand identity as well as to drive and support future enrollment growth.
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses for the three months ended February 28, 2009, increased by $16.1 million, or 29.3%, to $71.1 million, from $55.0 million in the three months ended February 29, 2008. G&A, as a percentage of net revenue, increased to 8.1% in the second quarter of 2009, versus 7.9% in the comparable period a year ago. The 20 basis point increase is mainly attributable to expenses related to the Company's self-reporting of a Title IV Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) compliance matter.
Financial and Operating Metrics
Below are Apollo Group's unaudited financial data and operating metrics for fiscal 2009.

Unaudited Six Months of Fiscal 2009 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the six months ended February 28, 2009, was $1.8 billion, a 25.3% increase over comparable period of fiscal 2008. Contributing to this increase was a 19.4% increase in University of Phoenix's average Degreed Enrollment during the six months ended February 28, 2009 as compared to the six months ended February 29, 2008.
The Company reported net income of $305.7 million, or $1.89 per share, (161.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), and $107.8 million, or $0.63 per share, (169.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the six months ended February 28, 2009, and February 29, 2008, respectively. Included in the fiscal 2008 results is a pre-tax charge of $168.4 million which represented an accrual for estimated damages stemming from an adverse jury verdict in a securities class action lawsuit. This charge was reversed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, when the trial court vacated the earlier judgment. Before giving effect to the litigation charge, net income was $210.1 million, or $1.24 per share (169.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), for the six months of fiscal 2008. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of February 28, 2009, the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash, totaled $908.8 million as compared to $511.5 million as of August 31, 2008. The increase is primarily attributable to cash generated from operations. Restricted cash and student deposits increased by approximately $114.2 million and $108.2 million since August 31, 2008, respectively. These increases were primarily due to increased student enrollment and to increases in Title IV funds available to students.
At February 28, 2009, accounts receivable declined to $194.0 million from $221.9 million at August 31, 2008. Excluding accounts receivable and the associated revenue for Apollo Global, the Company's days sales outstanding ("DSO") declined to 25 days at February 28, 2009 as compared to 30 days at February 29, 2008, and 29 days at August 31, 2008. The decrease in DSO is primarily due to improvements in processing time for the receipt of student financial aid as well as increased net revenue.
Total deferred revenue at February 28, 2009, increased to $247.5 million from $231.2 million at August 31, 2008. The increase is seasonal in nature and consistent with the Company's enrollment growth.

United Kingdom Dealing Disclosure Requirements
Under the provisions of Rule 8.3 of the United Kingdom Takeover Code (the "Code"), if any person is, or becomes, "interested" (directly or indirectly) in 1% or more of any class of "relevant securities" of BPP, all "dealings" in any "relevant securities" of that company (including by means of an option in respect of, or a derivative referenced to, any such "relevant securities") must be publicly disclosed by no later than 3:30 pm (London time) on the London business day following the date of the relevant transaction. This requirement will continue until the date on which the proposed offer becomes, or is declared, unconditional as to acceptances, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn or on which the "offer period" otherwise ends. If two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire an "interest" in "relevant securities" of BPP, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3.
Under the provisions of Rule 8.1 of the Code, all "dealings" in "relevant securities" of BPP by Apollo Group or BPP, or by any of their respective "associates", must be disclosed by no later than 12:00 noon (London time) on the London business day following the date of the relevant transaction.
A disclosure table, giving details of the companies in whose "relevant securities" "dealings" should be disclosed, and the number of such securities in issue, can be found on the Takeover Panel's website at www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk.
"Interests in securities" arise, in summary, when a person has long economic exposure, whether conditional or absolute, to changes in the price of securities. In particular, a person will be treated as having an "interest" by virtue of the ownership or control of securities, or by virtue of any option in respect of, or derivative referenced to, securities.
Terms in quotation marks are defined in the Code, which can also be found on the Panel's website. If you are in any doubt as to whether or not you are required to disclose a "dealing" under Rule 8, you should consult the Panel.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On June 7, 2009, Apollo UK Acquisition Company Limited ("Acquisition Company") and Apollo Global, Inc. ("Apollo Global") entered into an Implementation Agreement (the "Implementation Agreement") with BPP Holdings plc ("BPP"), a company registered in England and Wales. Pursuant to the Implementation Agreement, Acquisition Company issued an announcement (the "Rule 2.5 Announcement") pursuant to Rule 2.5 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the "City Code") disclosing that Acquisition Company and BPP had agreed on the terms of a recommended all cash acquisition (the "Acquisition") by Acquisition Company for the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of BPP, for cash of 620 pence per share. The Acquisition values BPP's existing issued and to be issued share capital at approximately 304 million (approximately $484 million based upon the current exchange rate). Acquisition Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apollo Global, which is an 80.1% owned subsidiary of Apollo Group, Inc.
     It is expected that the Acquisition will be effected by means of a scheme of arrangement (the "Scheme") under Part 26 of the UK Companies Act 2006. A scheme of arrangement involves an application by BPP to the High Court of Justice in England and Wales (the "Court") to sanction the Scheme and to confirm the reduction of BPP's share capital associated with the cancellation and extinguishing of the Scheme Shares (as defined below) provided for by the Scheme under section 137 of the Companies Act 1985 ("Capital Reduction"), that would enable Acquisition Company to become the owner of the entire issued share capital of BPP. The Scheme is subject to the approval at the meeting or meetings of the holders of Scheme Shares ("Scheme Shareholders") (and any adjournment thereof) to be convened pursuant to an order of the Court under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 for the purposes of considering and, if thought fit, approving the Scheme (with or without amendment) (the "Court Meeting"). Such approval requires the affirmative vote of a majority in number representing three-fourths or more in value of the Scheme Shareholders present and voting, either in person or by proxy, at the Court Meeting (or at any adjournment thereof).
     In addition, the Scheme will require special resolutions of BPP shareholders (the "General Meeting Resolutions") approving, among other things, the implementation of the Scheme and the Capital Reduction at an extraordinary general meeting of BPP shareholders to be convened in connection with the Scheme (the "General Meeting") by at least three-fourths of the votes cast. Furthermore, the Court must sanction the Scheme and confirm the Capital Reduction, and an office copy of the order of the Court sanctioning the Scheme under Part 26 of the Companies Act (the "Scheme Court Order") and of the Reduction Court Order and minute of such reduction attached thereto must be delivered to the Registrar of Companies, and in the case of the Reduction Court Order and minute, registered by the Registrar of Companies. If the Scheme becomes effective, it will be binding on all BPP shareholders, irrespective of whether they attended or how they voted at the Court Meeting or the General Meeting.
     "Scheme Shares" are the BPP shares:
Table of Contents
     Scheme Shares, however, do not include any BPP shares beneficially owned by Apollo Group, Inc. or its subsidiaries or held by BPP in treasury at or prior to the Capital Reduction Record Time.
     Under the Implementation Agreement, in lieu of the Scheme, Acquisition Company may, with the consent of the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers (the "Panel"), elect at any time to implement the proposed Acquisition by means of a takeover offer ("Offer"), provided that Acquisition Company must consult with BPP before making such election and shall consider any representations which BPP may make, and the terms and conditions of the Offer must in all material respects be at least as favorable to BPP's shareholders as the Scheme. If Acquisition Company elects to implement the proposed Acquisition by way of an Offer, the BPP directors must unanimously give an unqualified recommendation of the Offer except to the extent that the BPP directors have determined in good faith and in compliance with their fiduciary duties that such recommendation would not be in BPP shareholders' interests.
     BPP has entered into an inducement fee and exclusivity agreement with Apollo Global (on behalf of Acquisition Company) under which BPP has undertaken, among other things, not to solicit or initiate any possible offer for BPP or any other transaction which is inconsistent with, or an alternative to, the Acquisition. BPP has agreed to pay Acquisition Company an inducement fee equal to one percent of the value of the Acquisition (inclusive of any recoverable VAT), calculated on a fully diluted basis, if an Independent Inconsistent Transaction (as defined below) is announced under Rule 2.5 of the City Code which is subsequently approved or recommended by the BPP directors or subsequently becomes or is declared unconditional in all respects or is completed. If BPP is approached by a third party with a view to entering into a transaction which involves a change of control of at least 50 percent of the BPP shares, or which involves or contemplates the transfer of any interest in the whole, or substantially the whole of the undertaking, assets and/or business of BPP or any of its subsidiaries (an "Independent Inconsistent Transaction"), and prior to such Independent Inconsistent Transaction becoming the subject of an announcement under Rule 2.5 of the City Code the BPP directors determine (acting reasonably and in good faith) that they are intending to recommend such Independent Inconsistent Transaction, then BPP must, as soon as reasonably practicable, notify Acquisition Company of the fact of that approach and shall provide Acquisition Company a period of 72 hours to revise and amend the terms of the Acquisition during which they will not recommend the Independent Inconsistent Transaction. If Acquisition Company revises the terms of the Acquisition so that the value of the consideration is not less than the value offered by the Independent Inconsistent Transaction, the BPP directors shall recommend the revised Acquisition to the BPP shareholders.
     Under the Implementation Agreement, Acquisition Company and BPP have agreed to make antitrust filings to the Office of Fair Trading in the United Kingdom as soon as reasonably practicable and to assist and consult with each other in the preparation of such filings.
     The Acquisition is conditional upon the Scheme becoming effective by not later than November 30, 2009, or such later date as Acquisition Company and BPP may, with the consent of the Panel, agree and (if required) the Court may allow. The Scheme is also subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Rule 2.5 Announcement, including:
Table of Contents
     Pursuant to the Implementation Agreement, Acquisition Company may invoke any of the preceding conditions only with the consent of the Panel to invoke such condition with the effect that BPP would cause the Scheme to lapse and Acquisition Company would not be required to proceed with the Acquisition. There can be no assurance that the Panel would permit Acquisition Company to invoke any condition with such effect. The Acquisition will lapse and the Scheme will not proceed (unless the Panel otherwise consents) if before the date of the Court Meeting the Office of Fair Trading has referred the Acquisition to the Competition Commission. In addition, if the Scheme does not become effective on or before November 30, 2009, it will lapse and the Acquisition will not proceed, unless the Panel otherwise consents.
     The Implementation Agreement will terminate if:
     The Acquisition is expected to be funded with cash provided by Apollo Global, which may elect to finance all or a portion of its funding with external debt providers.
     The foregoing description of the Implementation Agreement and the Rule 2.5 Announcement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Implementation Agreement and the Rule 2.5 Announcement, which are attached as Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K. It is expected that the Scheme Document will be sent to BPP shareholders as soon as practicable.

upon the strong international reputation of UK degrees, the UK is the second largest market in the world for international students pursuing higher education qualifications. International student mobility is anticipated to continue to increase, benefiting the UK market.
The UK is also experiencing growth in the market for online educational programmes as evidenced by growth in online graduate business enrolments. Apollo Global expects that there will be increasing demand for flexible study options from working adults as well as traditional higher and secondary education students in the UK.
BPP's focus on academic quality and student outcomes has allowed it to maintain a high quality reputation amongst employers and consumers. The Company's Professional Education businesses, its Law School and the recently established Business School are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities provided in the market.
Benefits to BPP
Apollo Global is expected to have a significant impact on the operations and educational offerings of BPP. Apollo Group has more than 30 years' experience delivering a broad range of educational programmes and curricula through various modalities.
Apollo Group has significant expertise in the development, management and delivery of both online and campus-based education.

Apollo Group believes it is a global leader in the delivery of online education today and can assist BPP in its efforts to develop this modality further in the UK and other markets.
Apollo Group has historically focused on delivering educational solutions for the working adult. These include, but are not limited to, robust student services and support, online and on-campus course options, flexible schedules and access to significant learning resources designed around the needs of professionals. Apollo Group believes that it can assist BPP in further developing this market segment which is central to Apollo Group's strategy.
Additionally, through its Insight Schools Unit, Apollo Group participates in the US High School market (14-18 year old age group). Insight Schools offers curriculum and administrative services to public schools to operate full-time online programmes. Currently Insight Schools serves students in 10 states in the US.

Apollo Group, Inc. News Release
Phoenix, Arizona, June 8, 2009  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOL) ("Apollo Group" or "the Company") today announced that its 80.1%-owned subsidiary Apollo Global, Inc. has agreed to acquire UK-based BPP Holdings plc ("BPP") (LSE:BPP), a leading provider of education and training to professionals in the legal and finance industries. Apollo Global has agreed to purchase all of the outstanding shares of BPP at 620 pence per share in cash, representing an enterprise value of approximately $540 million. The transaction is structured as a court-sanctioned acquisition arrangement under the laws of the UK and is subject to court, shareholder and regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The transaction, if approved, is expected to close during Apollo Group's fiscal fourth quarter. The transaction terms and structure are described in more detail in a Form 8-K filed by Apollo Group today with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which includes a copy of the announcement released in the UK today by Apollo Global pursuant to applicable UK law.
The acquisition will provide Apollo Global with access to lifelong learning programs in the UK's professional education sector, establish a significant UK and pan European platform, and expand the range of advanced degrees and cross border educational opportunities available to its students.
"We're thrilled to be joining forces with this outstanding educational institution in the UK," said Greg Cappelli, co-chief executive officer of Apollo Group and chairman of Apollo Global.  "The combination of our brands, educational offerings and technological capabilities will provide greater opportunities for students and employees of both institutions. We look forward to working together and building upon the success of this world class organization."
"The offer provides an excellent opportunity for all of our stakeholders," said David Sugden, chairman of BPP Holdings. "For shareholders, it presents an opportunity to realize an attractive premium in cash for their shares. For our employees, it allows them to continue their excellent work in making BPP a leading education provider. For our customers, they will see our educational products enhanced by the expertise that Apollo will provide."
Founded in 1976 and based in London, England, BPP enjoys an excellent reputation among business and legal communities throughout Europe. The institution is organized into three business divisions: (1) Professional Education, which provides certification and continuing education; (2) College of Professional Studies, which operates four law schools, human resource training and a business school; and (3) Mander Portman Woodward (MPW), which operates independent fifth and sixth form colleges (similar to preparatory schools in the US). BPP is the first private sector institution to have been granted degree awarding powers in the UK.
 
"The UK is a large and growing market with strong student participation rates and an increasing interest in online learning," added Mr. Cappelli. "Furthermore, the UK has a tremendous international reputation for higher education and is the second largest market in the world for international students pursuing degrees. We believe this is an excellent market and company from which to establish our European base."
BPP's focus on academic quality and student outcomes has allowed it to maintain a high quality reputation amongst employers and consumers. The company's professional education business, fifth and six form colleges, law school and the recently established business school are all well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities provided in the market.

The distribution of this document and/or the accompanying documents (in whole or in part) in jurisdictions other than the United Kingdom may be restricted by the laws of those jurisdictions and therefore persons into whose possession this document comes should inform themselves about and observe any such restrictions.

A copy of this document will be published at www.bpp.com/ir/ not later than 12.00 noon (London time) on 23 June 2009 and will continue to be made available on that website during the Offer Period.
This document should be read as a whole, in conjunction with the accompanying documents.

Notes:
 
22 June 2009
Dear Shareholder,
Recommended all cash offer for BPP by Apollo UK, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apollo Global
On 29 April 2009, BPP announced that it had received a preliminary approach from Apollo Global which may or may not lead to an offer. On 8 June 2009, the BPP Directors and the Apollo UK Directors announced that they had reached agreement on the terms of a recommended all cash offer for the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of BPP by Apollo UK, a newly-incorporated wholly-owned subsidiary of Apollo Global, at a price of 620 pence per BPP Share. Apollo UK has been formed for the purpose of making the Acquisition. The Acquisition is to be effected by means of a scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006.
I am writing to you on behalf of the BPP Directors to explain the background to and detailed terms of the Acquisition, to encourage you to vote at the Meetings to be held on 15 July 2009, and to explain why the BPP Directors are unanimously recommending that BPP Shareholders vote at those Meetings in favour of the resolutions necessary to carry out the Acquisition.
The Acquisition is to be implemented by means of a scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006, which requires the approval of BPP Shareholders at the Court Meeting and General Meeting and the sanction of the Court.
Under the terms of the Scheme, which is subject to the satisfaction (or, where applicable, waiver) of the Conditions and to the further terms set out in Part III of this document, the holders of Scheme Shares at the Scheme Record Time will be entitled to receive:
 
The terms of the Acquisition value the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of BPP at approximately 303.5 million. The price represents a premium of:
If the Scheme becomes effective, all of the Scheme Shares will be cancelled and reissued to Apollo UK. BPP will thus become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apollo UK.
It is currently expected that (subject to the satisfaction or, as the case may be, waiver of the Conditions) the Effective Date will be on or about 30 July 2009, although this date will depend on, among other things, the date of the Court Hearing.
If the Scheme becomes effective, it will be binding on all Scheme Shareholders, irrespective of whether or not they attend or vote at the Court Meeting and/or the General Meeting. Further details of the Scheme, including the arrangements for settlement of the consideration payable to Scheme Shareholders, are set out in the Explanatory Statement contained in Part II of this document.
Subject to satisfaction of all relevant Conditions, application will be made to the UKLA for the listing of the BPP Shares on the Official List to be cancelled and to the London Stock Exchange for such shares to cease to be admitted to trading on its main market for listed securities, in each case as at 8.00 a.m. (London time) on 20 August 2009. Delisting will occur at that time in order to potentially secure beneficial tax treatment for certain participants in the BPP Share Schemes and for BPP.
Although the BPP Board believes that BPP would have a strong future as an independent business, in assessing whether the terms of the Acquisition are fair and reasonable, it considers that the Acquisition represents an opportunity for BPP Shareholders to realise the entire value of their investment at an attractive premium to the current market value of BPP, as set out in paragraph 2 above.
In addition, the BPP Board considers that the form of consideration being offered by Apollo Global provides all BPP Shareholders with the ability to crystallise fully the value of their investment at a time of general economic uncertainty.
Furthermore, the BPP Board believes that the terms of the Acquisition fairly reflect the current market position of BPP's business, its past performance to date and its prospects.
 
Apollo UK has received irrevocable undertakings to: (i) vote in favour of the Acquisition at the Court Meeting; (ii) vote in favour of the resolutions required to implement the Acquisition to be proposed at the General Meeting; and (iii) if the Acquisition is subsequently structured as a takeover offer, accept any potential recommended takeover offer made by Apollo Global, from all of the BPP Directors who have a beneficial holding of BPP Shares in respect of their entire beneficial interest, amounting to an aggregate of 48,156 BPP Shares, representing approximately 0.1 per cent of BPP's existing issued share capital. The BPP Directors who have given such irrevocable undertakings are as follows:
The undertakings shall lapse, , if the BPP Board withdraws its recommendation of the Acquisition.
inter alia
Further details of these undertakings, including details of the circumstances in which they will cease to be binding, are set out in paragraph 5 of Part V of this document.
Apollo Global recognises the significant achievements of the management team and employees of BPP in developing the BPP business, and attaches great importance to their skills and experience. They will be integral to the success of the Acquisition and Apollo Global believes that they will benefit from greater opportunities within the combined organisation. Apollo Global intends to support them fully in developing BPP's business in future.
Apollo Global has given the BPP Board assurances that, following completion of the Acquisition, the existing employment terms of both management and employees of BPP will be fully safeguarded. Apollo Global intends to retain BPP's key employees and foresees no significant changes to the primary conditions of employment of BPP's current employees or the principal locations of BPP's business.
Appropriate proposals will be made to holders of options/awards under the BPP Share Schemes. Full details of these proposals will be set out in separate letters which are to be sent to them in due course.
Further information about the effect of the Acquisition on options and awards outstanding under the BPP Share Schemes is set out in paragraph 8 of Part II of this document.
BPP is a leader in the provision of professional education and training, developing careers by helping people to attain and build on professional qualifications.
BPP provides its training and professional education through three separate operating divisions: BPP Professional Education, BPP College of Professional Studies and Mander Portman Woodward (premium independent fifth and sixth form colleges).
For the financial year ended 31 December 2008, BPP reported profit on ordinary activities before taxation of 19.6 million (2007: 18.5 million) on turnover of 165.5 million (2007: 150.0 million). Net assets as at 31 December 2008 were 14.9 million (31 December 2007: 16.1 million). 14 per cent. of revenues in 2008 were generated from outside the UK (2007: 14 per cent.).
 
On 30 April 2009, BPP released its Interim Management Statement in which the Chairman stated that:
"We are pleased to report a good start to the year continuing the progress achieved in 2008. Group revenue for the quarter to 31 March 2009 was 42.0 million, 4 per cent. ahead of the same period last year. As expected, the performance improvement initiatives launched in 2008 are starting to have an impact.
The performance of the business in the first quarter has been broadly in line with the trends we outlined at the time of our full year results announcement in March.
Our core Examinations and Law School businesses continue to perform well, benefiting from their significant pipeline of multi year programme students and premium market positions. As highlighted in our preliminary announcement in March 2009, although they only constitute a small part of our business, revenues directly exposed to the Financial Services sector and other short term discretionary courses have continued to weaken. Our focus on margins and cost control remains strong and to date we have been able to improve our margin.
The second half of the year is always an important period for our business when our Law, MPW and Accountancy Examinations businesses take on significant new enrolments. Whilst historically these enrolments have proved resilient in difficult economic circumstances, it is difficult to predict what impact, if any, current economic conditions may have on the business in the short to medium term.
The performance improvement action programmes resulting from our Full Potential Review are being implemented with an ongoing benefit to margins. One of these is the installation of our new integrated system for managing delivery of our services from customer booking through to delivery, invoicing and accounting. We have successfully implemented our new financial general ledger system. The front end customer system has not yet achieved the user testing standards we require to ensure that it will work faultlessly during our peak booking season in August and September. Consequently, we have taken the decision not to go fully live with this system until after the peak booking period to avoid putting at risk the substantial revenue generated during this time. This delay will mean that 1m of benefits expected to be realised in 2009 will not now be realised until next year. Despite this delay we remain confident that this system will fully deliver the expected benefits in 2010.
We are, however, maintaining our focus on performance improvement and the key programmes identified by our Full Potential Review and are confident that, by executing on our clear priorities, we will continue to deliver sustainable long term growth for our shareholders."
There has been no material change in the trading or prospects for BPP since that date.
BPP and Apollo Global entered into the Inducement Fee Letter on 29 April 2009. The Inducement Fee Letter includes BPP's agreement to pay to Apollo Global, in certain circumstances, an inducement fee of one per cent. of the value of the Acquisition (inclusive of any unrecoverable VAT), calculated on a fully diluted basis.
BPP, Apollo UK and Apollo Global also entered into the Implementation Agreement on 7 June 2009. It contains certain assurances in relation to the implementation of the Scheme and certain further agreements and confirmation between the parties, including provisions intended to further the implementation of the Scheme as soon as reasonably practicable.
Further details of the Inducement Fee Letter and the Implementation Agreement, including details of the inducement fee arrangements and the circumstances in which the Implementation Agreement may be terminated, are set out in paragraphs 7.1 and 7.2 of Part V of this document.
 
A summary of the certain UK tax consequences of the Scheme is set out in paragraph 12 of Part II of this document.
This summary is intended as a general guide only and if you are in any doubt as to your tax position, or if you are subject to taxation in any jurisdiction other than the UK, you should consult an appropriate independent professional tax adviser.
Your attention is drawn to pages 2 and 3 and paragraph 14 of Part II of this document, which explain the actions you should take in respect of voting on the Acquisition.
Overseas Shareholders should refer to paragraph 13 of Part II of this document for important information.
I draw your attention to the Explanatory Statement set out in Part II of this document, the full terms of the Scheme set out in Part VI, the additional information set out in Part V and the Notices of the Meetings in Part VIII and Part IX of this document.
You should read the whole of this document and not rely solely on the information contained in this letter or the Explanatory Statement.
The BPP Board, which has been so advised by Hawkpoint, considers the terms of the Acquisition to be fair and reasonable. In providing its advice to the BPP Board, Hawkpoint has taken into account the commercial assessments of the BPP Board.
The BPP Board considers that the Acquisition is in the best interests of BPP Shareholders as a whole. Accordingly, the BPP Board unanimously recommends that BPP Shareholders vote in favour of the resolutions to be proposed at the Court Meeting and the General Meeting, as the Shareholder Directors have irrevocably undertaken to do (or directed to be done) in respect of their entire beneficial holdings of BPP Shares amounting to, in aggregate, 48,156 BPP Shares, representing approximately 0.1 per cent. of the existing issued share capital of BPP.
Yours faithfully,
David Sugden
Chairman
 
22 June 2009
Dear Shareholder,
Recommended all cash offer for BPP by Apollo UK, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apollo Global
On 29 April 2009, BPP announced that it had received a preliminary approach from Apollo Global which may or may not lead to an offer. On 8 June 2009, the BPP Directors and the Apollo UK Directors announced that they had reached agreement on the terms of a recommended all cash offer for the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of BPP by Apollo UK at a price of 620 pence per BPP Share. Apollo UK has been formed for the purposes of making the Acquisition. The Acquisition is to be effected by means of a scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006.
Your attention is drawn to the letter from the Chairman of BPP, set out in Part I of this document, which forms part of this Explanatory Statement.

The BPP Board has been advised by Hawkpoint in connection with the Acquisition and the Scheme and in providing advice to the BPP Board, Hawkpoint has taken into account the commercial assessment of the BPP Board. Hawkpoint has been authorised by the BPP Board to write to you to set out the terms of the Acquisition and to provide you with other relevant information. The terms of the Scheme are set out in full in Part VI of this document. Your attention is also drawn to the other parts of this document all of which form part of this Explanatory Statement.

Apollo UK
Apollo UK was incorporated in England and Wales as a private limited company with registered number 6920380 on 1 June 2009. Apollo UK has been formed for the purposes of making the Acquisition and has not traded since incorporation, nor has it entered into any obligations other than in connection with the Acquisition. The authorised share capital of Apollo UK as at 19 June 2009 being the last practicable date prior to the posting of this document was 1,000, divided into 1,000 ordinary shares of 1.00 each, of which two shares have been issued and are owned by Apollo Global.
Further information about Apollo UK, including a list of directors, is set out in paragraphs 2.5 and 2.6 of Part V of this document.
Apollo Global
Apollo Global, a joint venture formed in 2007, is 80.1 per cent. owned by Apollo Group and 19.9 per cent. owned by private equity firm The Carlyle Group. Apollo Global was formed with the intention of making a range of investments in the international education services sector.

Apollo Group
Apollo Group has been an education provider for more than 30 years. Through its subsidiaries, the University of Phoenix, the Institute for Professional Development, the College for Financial Planning, Western International University and Meritus University, Apollo Group has established itself as a leading provider of higher education programmes in the United States primarily by focusing on meeting the needs of the working adult.
Apollo Global was formed in 2007 with the intention of making a range of investments in the international education services sector, primarily in countries outside the US with attractive demographic and economic growth characteristics.
Apollo Global believes that the opportunities provided by the UK education market and BPP's leading brand, together with the depth and breadth of talent of BPP's management team and employee base, make BPP an attractive investment. Apollo Global has noted BPP's growth profile along with its ability to enter new markets and consistently expand its course offerings.
Acquisition Rationale
The UK is an attractive market for Apollo Global. Student participation rates in both the professional and legal markets have steadily increased over time as employment opportunities in these sectors have increased. Additionally, the overall penetration rates of higher education amongst school age students have seen a steady increase and are expected to continue over time. Based largely upon the strong international reputation of UK degrees, the UK is the second largest market in the world for international students pursuing higher education qualifications. International student mobility is anticipated to continue to increase, benefiting the UK market.
The UK is also experiencing growth in the market for online educational programmes as evidenced by growth in online graduate business enrolments. Apollo Global expects that there will be increasing demand for flexible study options from working adults as well as traditional higher and secondary education students in the UK.
BPP's focus on academic quality and student outcomes has allowed it to maintain a high quality reputation amongst employers and consumers. BPP's Professional Education businesses, its Law School and the recently established Business School are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities provided in the market.
Benefits to BPP
Apollo Global is expected to have a significant impact on the operations and educational offerings of BPP. Apollo Group has more than 30 years' experience delivering a broad range of educational programmes and curricula through various modalities.
Apollo Group has significant expertise in the development, management and delivery of both online and campus-based education. Online education has become an increasingly important delivery mechanism throughout the world as it provides greater access and flexibility for students. Apollo Group believes it is a global leader in the delivery of online education today and can assist BPP in its efforts to develop this modality further in the UK and other markets.
Apollo Group has historically focused on delivering educational solutions for the working adult. These include, but are not limited to, robust student services and support, online and on-campus course options, flexible schedules and access to significant learning resources designed around the needs of professionals. Apollo Group believes that it can assist BPP in further developing this market segment which is central to Apollo Group's strategy.
 
Additionally, through its Insight Schools Unit, Apollo Group participates in the US High School market (14-18 year-old age group). Insight Schools offers curriculum and administrative services to public schools to operate full-time online programmes. Currently Insight Schools serves students in 10 states in the US. Apollo Group believes that it is in a unique position to assist BPP in further growing and developing its schools business in a variety of ways.
Apollo Global appreciates the importance of the key safeguards which ensure that high quality education and training are provided to BPP's customers, and plans to uphold the integrity and quality of the educational products at BPP. Apollo is committed to supporting the key processes and procedures put in place to safeguard delivery of BPP's educational programmes, especially the independent Academic Council for the College and understands the need to comply with the various applicable external educational and training regulatory frameworks.
Benefits to Apollo Global
The acquisition of BPP would provide Apollo Global with access to life-long learning products in the professional education sector. It would establish a significant UK and pan-European platform for Apollo Global, enabling it to expand the range of advanced degrees and cross-border educational opportunities it offers its students.
The Acquisition will be funded by cash provided by Apollo Global.
As required by the City Code, Credit Suisse, as financial adviser to Apollo UK, has confirmed that it is satisfied that sufficient resources are available to Apollo UK to satisfy in full the cash consideration payable to BPP Shareholders under the terms of the Acquisition.
Details of the interests of the BPP Directors in the share capital of BPP, and options and awards in respect of such share capital, are set out in paragraph 4.2 of Part V of this document. BPP Shares held by the BPP Directors will be subject to the Scheme.
As outlined in paragraph 4 of Part I, the Shareholder Directors have undertaken to vote their BPP Shares in favour of the resolutions to be proposed at the General Meeting and the Court Meeting.
Particulars of the service contracts (including termination provisions) and letters of appointment of the BPP Directors are set out in paragraph 8 of Part V of this document. No amendments to such service contracts or letters of appointment have been agreed in connection with the Acquisition.
No agreement or undertaking has been reached as to the position of the BPP Directors once the Scheme becomes effective.
The effect of the Scheme on the options and awards held by the BPP Directors and other participants in the BPP Share Schemes is summarised in paragraph 8 of this Part II.
Save as set out below, the effect of the Scheme on the interests of the BPP Directors does not differ from its effect on the like interests of any other person.
For regulatory reasons connected with the current transaction BPP was unable to grant the awards which the Remuneration Committee had resolved should be made to the BPP Executive Directors under the BPP Share Schemes for the current financial year (the "2009 Awards"). It is therefore proposed to pay to such BPP Executive Directors upon the Scheme becoming effective a cash amount equal to the amount which they would have realised had BPP been able to grant the 2009 Awards at the normal time. The aggregate amount of the payments is 740,252 (which assumes the Scheme become effective on 30 July 2009 as currently expected). Further details of these payments are set out in paragraph 4.2(b) of Part V of this document.
 
In recognition of the satisfaction of certain of the targets set for them, BPP also proposes to pay out an amount in respect of the BPP Executive Directors' discretionary annual bonuses upon the Scheme becoming effective. The amount payable is equal to 50 per cent of their maximum bonus opportunity. The aggregate amount of these accelerated bonus payments is 372,844. Further details of these payments are set out in paragraph 8.2(b) of Part V of this document.
In addition, an aggregate payment of 244,500 retained by BPP from the BPP Executive Directors' annual bonuses for the previous financial year will be released to them. Further details of this payment are set out in paragraph 8.2(b) of Part V of this document.
The terms of the Scheme, if it becomes effective, will bind all BPP Shareholders, including persons acquiring BPP Shares prior to the Scheme Record Time under the terms of the BPP Share Schemes.
Appropriate proposals will be made to holders of options and awards under the BPP Share Schemes. Full details of these proposals will be set out in separate letters which are to be sent to them in due course.
 
 
 
 
The last day of dealings in, and for registration of transfers of, BPP Shares is expected to be the business day before the Court Hearing. Accordingly, the last day of dealings in BPP Shares is expected to be 29 July 2009, following which BPP Shares will be suspended from trading on the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities with effect from 5:30 p.m. (London time).
BPP intends that, prior to the Scheme becoming effective, applications will be made to the FSA for the listing of the BPP Shares to be cancelled and to the London Stock Exchange for the BPP Shares to cease to be admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities with effect on the Effective Date. Accordingly, it is intended that, if the Court sanctions the Scheme and confirms the Capital Reduction on 29 July 2009, the delisting will become effective at 8.00 a.m. (London time) on 20 August 2009. Delisting will occur at that time in order to potentially secure beneficial tax treatment for certain participants in the BPP Share Schemes and for BPP.
 
The following paragraphs, which are intended as a general guide only, are based on current UK tax legislation and what is understood to be the current HMRC practice, all of which is subject to change, possibly with retrospective effect. They summarise certain limited aspects of the UK taxation treatment of the Scheme for Scheme Shareholders and do not purport to be a complete analysis of all tax considerations relating to the Acquisition. The following paragraphs do not constitute tax advice and relate only to the position of Scheme Shareholders who are resident and, in the case of individuals, ordinarily resident and domiciled in the UK for taxation purposes, who hold their Scheme Shares as an investment (other than under a personal equity plan or an individual savings account), who are the absolute beneficial owners of their Scheme
 
Shares, and who have not (and are not deemed to have) acquired their Scheme Shares by virtue of an office or employment. Further, the comments in the following paragraphs may not apply to certain classes of Scheme Shareholders such as collective investment schemes and insurance companies. For the avoidance of doubt, the comments in the following paragraphs do not apply to any intermediate holding vehicles such as trusts, pensions etc. If you are in any doubt about the tax consequences of the Scheme in your own particular circumstances, you should consult an appropriate independent professional tax adviser. The following paragraphs do not consider the UK taxation consequences should Apollo Global and/or Apollo UK (with the consent of the Panel) elect to implement the Acquisition by way of a contractual takeover offer. Such consequences would be set out in a separate offer document.
Special tax provisions may apply to BPP Shareholders who have acquired or who acquire their Shares by exercising options or receiving vested BPP Shares under the BPP Share Schemes. The UK tax treatment of such BPP Shareholders will be summarised in separate communications to such BPP Shareholders, but such BPP Shareholders who are in any doubt as to their taxation position should consult an independent professional tax adviser.
The implications (and availability) of the Scheme and the Acquisition for Overseas Shareholders may be affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdictions. Overseas Shareholders should inform themselves about and observe any applicable requirements in those jurisdictions. It is the responsibility of each Overseas Shareholder to satisfy himself/herself as to the full observance of the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in connection therewith, including the obtaining of any governmental, exchange control or other consents which may be required, or the compliance with other necessary formalities which are required to be observed and the payment of any issue, transfer or other taxes due in such jurisdiction.
The distribution of this document and the accompanying documents in jurisdictions outside the United Kingdom may be restricted by law and therefore persons in such jurisdictions into whose possession this document comes should inform themselves about and observe such restrictions. Any failure to comply with the applicable restrictions may constitute a violation of the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.
This document and the accompanying documents have been prepared for the purposes of complying with English law, the Listing Rules and the City Code, and the information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been disclosed if this document had been prepared in accordance with the laws of jurisdictions outside the United Kingdom. Nothing in this document should be relied upon for any other reason.
 
Neither this document nor the accompanying documents are intended to, and do not, constitute an offer or invitation to sell, purchase, subscribe for or issue any securities or the solicitation of an offer to buy or subscribe for securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation is unlawful.
BPP Shareholders in the United States should note that the Acquisition relates to the shares of a UK company and will be governed by English law. Neither the proxy solicitation nor the tender offer rules under the US Securities Exchange Act 1934, will apply to the Scheme. Moreover, the Scheme will be subject to the disclosure requirements and practices applicable in the United Kingdom to schemes of arrangement, which differ from the disclosure requirements of the US proxy solicitation rules and tender offer rules. Financial information included in the relevant documentation has been prepared in accordance with accounting standards applicable in the UK that may not be comparable to financial information to US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. If Apollo UK (with the consent of the Panel) exercises its rights to implement the Acquisition by way of a contractual takeover offer, such offer, if made into the United States, will be made in compliance with applicable US tender offer and securities laws and regulations.
To become effective, the Scheme requires, among other things, the approval by a majority in number of the Scheme Shareholders who vote, representing at least 75 per cent. in value of the Scheme Shares voted, either in person or by proxy, at the Court Meeting.
The Scheme also requires the sanction of the Court and the passing of the Special Resolution, which requires the approval of at least 75 per cent. of the votes cast at the General Meeting. Upon the Scheme becoming effective, it will be binding on all BPP Shareholders, irrespective of whether or not they attended or voted at the Court Meeting or the General Meeting and whether they voted for or against, or abstained from voting on, the resolutions proposed at such Meetings.
Forms of Proxy for the Court Meeting and the General Meeting should be returned, in the pre-paid envelope provided (for use in the UK only) or by post or (during business hours only) by hand to Capita Registrars, Proxy Department, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4TU as soon as possible and, in any event, so as to be received no later than 48 hours before the time appointed for the relevant Meeting (or, in the case of adjournment(s), not later than 48 hours before the time fixed for the holding of the adjourned Meeting(s)). If the blue Form of Proxy for use at the Court Meeting is not returned by the above time, it may be handed to a representative of Capita Registrars, on behalf of the chairman of the Court Meeting, before the start of that Meeting. However, in the case of the General Meeting, the white Form of Proxy must be returned by the time mentioned above or it will be invalid. The completion and return of a Form of Proxy will not prevent you from attending and voting in person at either the Court Meeting or the General Meeting, or at any adjournment thereof, if you so wish and are so entitled.
It is important that, for the Court Meeting, as many votes as possible are cast so that the Court may be satisfied that there is a fair representation of Scheme Shareholder opinion. You are therefore strongly urged to complete and return both of your Forms of Proxy as soon as possible.
If you have any questions in relation to this document, the Meetings, or the completion and return of the Forms of Proxy, please telephone Capita Registrars between 9.00 a.m. and 5.00 p.m. (London time) Monday to Friday (except UK public holidays) on 0871 664 0321 from within the UK or +44 20 8639 3399 if calling from outside the UK. Calls to the 0871 664 0321 number cost 10 pence per minute (including VAT) plus your service provider's network extras. Calls to the helpline from outside the UK will be charged at applicable international rates. Different charges may apply to calls from mobile telephones and call may be recorded and randomly monitored for security and training purposes. The helpline cannot provide advice on the merits of the Scheme nor give any financial, legal or tax advice.
 
The terms of the Scheme are set out in full in Part VI of this document. Your attention is also drawn to the further information contained in this document, all of which forms part of this Explanatory Statement, and, in particular, to the Conditions set out in Part III, the financial information on BPP incorporated by reference in Part IV and the additional information set out in Part V of this document.

Right to Appoint a Proxy; Procedure for Appointment
Scheme Shareholders entitled to attend and vote at the Court Meeting may vote in person at such meeting or they may appoint another person or persons, whether a member of the Company or not, as their proxy or proxies, to exercise all or any of their rights to attend, speak and vote at the Court Meeting.
A blue form of proxy ("Form of Proxy"), for use at the Court Meeting, is enclosed with this notice. Instructions for its use are set out on the form. It is requested that the blue Form of Proxy (together with any power of attorney or other authority, if any, under which it is signed, or a duly certified copy thereof) be lodged with Capita Registrars, Proxy Department, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4TU by post or (during normal business hours only) by hand, not later than 10.00 a.m. (London time) on 13 July 2009 or, in the case of an adjournment of the Court Meeting, 48 hours before the time appointed for the adjourned meeting. However, if not so lodged, blue Forms of Proxy (together with any such authority, if applicable) may be handed to a representative of Capita Registrars, on behalf of the chairman of the Court Meeting, at the Court Meeting.
Scheme Shareholders are entitled to appoint a proxy in respect of some or all of their Scheme Shares and may also appoint more than one proxy, provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by such holder. Scheme Shareholders who wish to appoint more than one proxy in respect of their holding of Scheme Shares should contact Capita Registrars for further Forms of Proxy.
Completion and return of a Form of Proxy will not prevent a holder of Scheme Shares from attending, speaking and voting in person at the Court Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, if such Shareholder wishes and is entitled to do so.
 
Voting Record Time
Entitlement to attend, speak and vote at the Court Meeting or any adjournment thereof and the number of votes which may be cast at the Court Meeting, will be determined by reference to the register of members of the Company at 6.00 p.m. (London time) on 13 July 2009 or, if the Court Meeting is adjourned, 6.00 p.m. (London time) on the date two days before the date fixed for the adjourned meeting. Changes to the register of members after the relevant time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend, speak and vote at the Court Meeting.
Joint Holders
In the case of joint holders of Scheme Shares, the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, will be accepted to the exclusion of the vote(s) of the other joint holder(s). For this purpose, seniority will be determined by the order in which the names stand in the register of members of the Company in respect of the joint holding.
Corporate Representatives
As an alternative to appointing a proxy, any Scheme Shareholder which is a corporation may vote by a corporate representative appointed in accordance with the Act. Details of certain arrangements which will be put in place in order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the Court Meeting are set out on pages 2 and 3 of the document of which this Notice forms part.
By the said Order, the Court has appointed David Sugden or, failing him, Chris Ross-Roberts or, failing him, Michael Kirkham, to act as chairman of the Court Meeting and has directed the chairman to report the result thereof to the Court.
The Scheme will be subject to the subsequent sanction of the Court.

Nominated Persons
The statements of the rights of Scheme Shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies above do not apply to a person nominated under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy information rights (a "Nominated Person"). Such rights can only be exercised by members of the Company. Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a Nominated Person may, under an agreement between such Nominated Person and the member by whom he or she was nominated, have a right to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the Court Meeting. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he or she may, under any such agreement, have a right to give instructions to the member as to the exercise of voting rights.
Nominated Persons are reminded that they should contact the registered holder(s) of the shares in respect of which they were nominated (and not the Company) on matters relating to their investments in the Company.

Table of Contents

Exhibit 99.1
Phoenix, Arizona, June 29, 2009  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or "the Company") today reported financial results for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2009.
Unaudited Third Quarter of Fiscal 2009 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the three months ended May 31, 2009, totaled $1,051.3 million, which represents a 25.9% increase over the third quarter of fiscal 2008. Contributing to the growth was a 21.8% year-over-year increase in University of Phoenix total Degreed Enrollment to 420,700. The Company reported net income for the three months ended May 31, 2009, of $201.1 million, or $1.26 per share (159.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to net income of $139.1 million, or $0.85 per share (163.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended May 31, 2008.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company repurchased approximately 7.2 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $61.62 per share for a total expenditure of $444.4 million (of which $38.8 million is included in accrued liabilities for repurchased shares that settled subsequent to May 31, 2009). On June 25, 2009, the Board of Directors authorized an increase of the share repurchase program to an aggregate of $500 million.
Included in the fiscal 2008 third quarter results is a pre-tax charge of $1.6 million associated with the judgment in a securities class action lawsuit. This charge was reversed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 when the trial court vacated the judgment. Before giving effect to the litigation charge, net income was $140.1 million, or $0.85 per share (163.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), in the third quarter of fiscal 2008. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
"We are pleased to report a record third quarter, driven largely by continuing increases in enrollments and improved student retention at University of Phoenix," said Co-Chief Executive Officer of Apollo Group, Chas Edelstein. "When our students succeed academically, we succeed financially and, for the first time in a quarter, Apollo surpassed the $1 billion revenue mark."

Co-Chief Executive Officer of Apollo Group and Chairman of Apollo Global, Greg Cappelli, added, "We are also encouraged by the recent advancement of our strategic investments through Apollo Global, best demonstrated by our pending acquisition of the highly regarded BPP Holdings plc in the desirable UK market."
Instructional costs and services increased by $52.6 million, or 15.1% to $400.2 million for the three months ended May 31, 2009, from $347.6 million in the three months ended May 31, 2008. As a percentage of net revenue, instructional costs and services declined 350 basis points to 38.1% versus 41.6% in the prior year's third quarter. The improvement was predominantly due to University of Phoenix continuing to leverage its fixed costs, such as certain wages, classroom space and depreciation expense. University of Phoenix has grown its variable headcount at a slower rate than the increase in net revenue. The Company also benefited from savings due to lower negotiated contract costs in financial aid processing and other areas. This was partially offset by higher expenses, as a percentage of net revenue, at Apollo Global associated with its start-up and development and other infrastructure and support costs, as well as, a 100 basis point increase to 3.4%, as a percentage of net revenue, in bad debt expense versus the third quarter of fiscal 2008. The increases are primarily due to the increased risk of collecting aged receivables and lower collection rates on those receivables given the current economic downturn.
Selling and promotional expenses increased by $40.0 million, or 19.6%, to $243.6 million for the three months ended May 31, 2009, from $203.6 million in the three months ended May 31, 2008. As a percentage of net revenue, selling and promotional expenses declined 120 basis points to 23.2% versus 24.4% in the prior year's third quarter. This was mainly a result of continued improvement in enrollment counselor effectiveness at University of Phoenix. Additionally, investments in marketing resulted in more effective and efficient advertising at University of Phoenix. The Company continues to invest in marketing to build greater brand identity as well as to drive and support future enrollment growth.
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses for the three months ended May 31, 2009, increased by $10.6 million, or 17.4%, to $71.5 million, from $60.9 million in the three months ended May 31, 2008. As a percentage of net revenue, G&A expenses decreased 50 basis points to 6.8% versus 7.3% in the prior year's third quarter. The improvement is mainly attributable to the continued leverage of relatively fixed employee compensation costs for executive management, finance and IT personnel.

Unaudited Nine Months of Fiscal 2009 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the nine months ended May 31, 2009, was $2.9 billion, a 25.5% increase over the comparable period of fiscal 2008. Contributing to this increase was a 20.3% increase in University of Phoenix's average Degreed Enrollment during the nine months ended May 31, 2009, as compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2008. University of Phoenix New Degreed Enrollment during the first nine months of fiscal 2009 increased 23.7% as compared with the first nine months of fiscal 2008.
The Company reported net income of $506.8 million, or $3.15 per share, (161.0 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), and $246.9 million, or $1.47 per share, (167.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the nine months ended May 31, 2009, and May 31, 2008, respectively. Included in the fiscal 2008 results is a pre-tax charge of $170.0 million associated with the judgment in a securities class action lawsuit. This charge was reversed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 when the trial court vacated the earlier judgment. Before giving effect to the litigation charge, net income was $350.2 million, or $2.09 per share (167.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), for the nine months of fiscal 2008. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of May 31, 2009, the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash, totaled $819.1 million as compared to $511.5 million as of August 31, 2008. The increase is primarily attributable to cash generated from operations, partially offset by share repurchases. Restricted cash and student deposits increased by approximately $105.5 million and $92.4 million since August 31, 2008, respectively. These increases were primarily due to increased student enrollment and to increases in Title IV funds available to students.
At May 31, 2009, accounts receivable declined to $192.6 million from $221.9 million at August 31, 2008, primarily due to improvements in processing time for the receipt of student financial aid and an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts. Excluding accounts receivable and the associated revenue for Apollo Global, the Company's days sales outstanding ("DSO") declined to 24 days at May 31, 2009, as compared to 26 days at May 31, 2008, and 29 days at August 31, 2008. The decrease in DSO is primarily due to improvements in processing time for the receipt of student financial aid as well as increased net revenue.
Total deferred revenue at May 31, 2009, increased to $261.2 million from $231.2 million at August 31, 2008. The increase is seasonal in nature and consistent with the Company's enrollment growth.
Subsequent to the quarter end, Apollo Global entered into an Implementation Agreement to acquire BPP Holdings plc ("BPP"), a UK-based provider of education and training to professionals in the legal and finance industries. Pursuant to the acquisition arrangement, Apollo Global will acquire all of the outstanding shares of BPP for a cash purchase price of 620 pence
4
 
per share, which represents an enterprise value of approximately $540 million based upon the exchange rate on June 5, 2009. In connection with the acquisition, the Company was required to provide assurance that it has the funds to execute the transaction. As a result, the Company provided an intercompany loan to Apollo Global to fund an escrow account with $550 million to be used solely to fund the purchase price in this acquisition. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2009.

At current exchange rates, the purchase price for BPP, including assumed term debt and seasonally drawn revolver, as well as transaction related expenses, less cash acquired, is approximately $607 million. The Acquisition, less net debt assumed, is being funded by an intercompany loan of approximately $104 million from Apollo Group to Apollo Global, $375 million in capital contributions from Apollo Group and $55 million in capital contributions from Apollo Global's minority shareholder, the Carlyle Group ("Carlyle"). After this Acquisition and including all previous capital contributions, Apollo Group's ownership in Apollo Global has increased to approximately 86.1% from the previous 80.1%.

Exhibit 99.2
Phoenix, Arizona, July 30, 2009  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOL) ("Apollo Group" "Apollo" or "the Company") today announced that its majority-owned subsidiary Apollo Global, Inc. has completed the previously announced acquisition of UK-based BPP Holdings plc (LSE:BPP) ("BPP").
"We are excited to welcome BPP to Apollo Global and look forward to joining together to provide enhanced educational advancement and career development opportunities to professionals in the UK and throughout Europe," said Greg Cappelli, co-chief executive officer of Apollo Group and chairman of Apollo Global.  "BPP provides us with an ideal platform from which we can expand our European presence. We have long been impressed with BPP, the reputation of its academic programs, the caliber of the faculty and employees, and the leadership and direction of its management team. Together our organizations are a good fit strategically, operationally and culturally."
In accordance with the previously announced terms of the transaction, Apollo Global purchased all of the outstanding shares of BPP at 620 pence per share in cash. At current exchange rates, the purchase price for BPP, including assumed term debt and seasonally drawn revolver, as well as transaction related expenses, less cash acquired, is approximately $607 million. The transaction, less net debt assumed, is being funded by an intercompany loan of approximately $104 million from Apollo Group to Apollo Global, $375 million in capital contributions from Apollo Group and $55 million in capital contributions from Apollo Global's minority shareholder, the Carlyle Group ("Carlyle"). After this transaction and including all previous capital contributions, Apollo Group's ownership in Apollo Global has increased to approximately 86.1% from the previous 80.1%. Based upon the preliminary purchase price allocation, the Company does not expect the acquisition to have a material impact on its earnings per share in fiscal 2010 and believes BPP will create long-term shareholder value.
Brooke Coburn, managing director and head of Carlyle Growth Partners and a member of the Board of Apollo Global, added, "We are delighted with the addition of the BPP organization into our portfolio of education investments. We are excited about the potential of the large and growing global education sector, and we are pleased to have an organization with the history and reputation of BPP as a platform to expand this mission into the European market."
"This is an exciting opportunity for BPP," said Roger Siddle, chief executive officer of BPP Holdings.  "Joining Apollo Global will provide the business with access to Apollo's substantial expertise and resources, helping us continue to innovate and deliver the high quality education
 
our students and customers expect. The combination of our leading positions in our chosen markets, breadth of teaching talent, and Apollo's deep understanding and experience in delivering a broad range of educational programs will create a stronger force in the European market and greater opportunities for BPP's students and employees. I look forward to being a part of the continuing success of the combined organization."
Founded in 1976 and based in London, England, BPP is a leading provider of education and training to professionals in the legal and finance industries. It is organized into three business divisions: (1) Professional Education, which provides certification and continuing education in accounting and tax, professional development and financial services; (2) College of Professional Studies, which operates four law schools, human resource training and a business school; and (3) Mander Portman Woodward (MPW), which operates independent fifth and sixth form colleges (similar to preparatory schools in the US).

Exhibit 99.3
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors and Shareholders BPP Holdings Plc
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of BPP Holdings Plc and subsidiaries ("the Group") as of 31 December 2008, and the related consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of recognised income and expense, and consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Group's management and the Board of Directors. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Group's internal control over financial reporting. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
IAS 1 requires that financial statements be presented with comparative financial information. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared solely for the purpose of meeting the requirements of Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly no comparative financial information is presented.
In our opinion, except for the omission of comparative financial information as discussed in the preceding paragraph, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of BPP Holdings Plc and subsidiaries as of 31 December 2008, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flow for the year then ended in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.

1 GENERAL INFORMATION
AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
BPP Holdings Plc (the "Company", "BPP") is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The consolidated statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 comprise those of the company and its subsidiaries (the "Group"). On 30 July 2009, Apollo UK Acquisition Company Limited completed the acquisition of the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of BPP Holdings plc for a cash purchase price of 620 pence per share. Apollo UK Acquisition Company Limited is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apollo Global, Inc., which is a majority-owned subsidiary of Apollo Group, Inc.
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out in note 2.
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(A) BASIS OF PREPARATION
IAS 1 requires that the financial statements be presented with comparative financial information. These consolidated statements have been prepared solely for the purposes of meeting the requirements of Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly no comparative information is presented.
Except for the omission of comparative information as discussed in the preceding paragraph, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee (IFRIC) interpretations.
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008.
The Group financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds ('000s) except where otherwise indicated.
The directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis. As discussed in note 22, following the acquisition by Apollo Global, Inc., all of the Group's outstanding bank loans became repayable on 31 October 2009. The Group is in the process of refinancing its banking facilities but no agreement is in place as yet. The ultimate parent undertaking, Apollo Group, Inc. has committed that in the event that BPP is unable to maintain its existing facilities with The Royal Bank of Scotland and is further unable to replace such credit agreements with third party financing with an equivalent aggregate loan amount, Apollo Group, Inc. will loan to BPP such funds, not to exceed the total aggregate loan amount under the current facilities, as are necessary to enable BPP and its subsidiaries to pay their debts as they become due for a period up to 31 March 2010.
(B) JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The key estimates and assumptions are set out in the accounting policies below, together with the related notes to the accounts.
Such estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances and constitute management's best judgement at the date of the financial statements. In the future, actual experience may deviate from these estimates and assumptions, which could affect the financial statements as the original estimates and assumptions are modified, as appropriate, in the year in which the circumstances change.
 
(C) BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of BPP Holdings Plc and the entities it controls drawn up to 31 December each year.
Subsidiaries and special purpose entities are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date on which control ceases.
Minority interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is presented within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from Parent shareholders' equity.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
(D) EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
The Group presents as exceptional items, in the income statement and in the notes to the financial statements, those material items of income and expense which, because of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation. This is to allow shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess better trends in financial performance.
(E) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates for the year. The resulting exchange differences are taken directly to a separate component of equity. On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.
In respect of all foreign operations, any exchange differences that arose before 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are deemed to be nil and will be excluded from the determination of any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
(F) PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
All property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment, except for land, which is shown at cost less impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation on assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of each asset less its residual value (based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date) over its estimated useful life, as follows:
Assets under construction are depreciated from the date they become available for use.
The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount (the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use) if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are included in the income statement.
Borrowing costs incurred for the construction of any qualifying assets (those assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use) are capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use. Other borrowing costs are expensed when incurred.
 
(G) INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill
Business combinations on or after 1 January 2004 are accounted for under IFRS 3  Business Combinations, using the purchase method. Any excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised in the balance sheet as goodwill and is not amortised. To the extent that the net fair value of the acquired entity's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of the investment, a gain is recognised immediately in the income statement. Goodwill recognised as an asset as at 31 December 2003 is recorded at its carrying amount under UK GAAP and is not amortised.
Licences
Licences have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of licences over their estimated useful lives of five years.
Software
Software acquired is initially capitalised at cost. It has a finite useful life and is amortised using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life. Software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Software acquired has a useful life of up to five years.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs are expensed as incurred.
Software development costs are recognised as an intangible asset when the Group can demonstrate the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use, its intention to complete and its ability to use the asset, how the asset will generate future economic benefits, the availability of resources to complete the asset and the ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives not exceeding eight years.
Software in development that is not yet being amortised is tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
(H) IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is tested at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying value may be impaired. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Assets that are subject to amortisation (licences and software) or depreciation (property, plant and equipment) are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows (cash-generating units).
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased, although impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
(I) FINANCIAL ASSETS
The Group classifies all financial assets as loans and receivables. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date.
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value (the transaction price plus directly attributable transaction costs). Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available for sale. Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced, through the use of an allowance account, with the amount of the loss recognised in administration expenses.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
 
Loans and receivables are included in trade and other receivables in the balance sheet.
(J) FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition. The classifications used are presented in note 24.
Financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value, and in the case of loans and borrowings, include directly attributable transaction costs.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement.
The Group's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, bank overdrafts, loans and borrowings and derivative financial instruments.
(K) DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the income statement.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated.
The Group has only entered into cash flow hedges. For these, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the income statement or to the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above. If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to profit or loss.
(L) INVENTORIES
Inventories are principally books, which are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. External creative costs and artwork costs of new titles are absorbed into the cost of the first print run. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
(M) TRADE RECEIVABLES
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an adjustment for doubtful debts. Bad debts are written off to the income statement when identified. Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full. Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
(N) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and short term deposits in the balance sheet include cash at banks and in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
(O) SHARE CAPITAL
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in the share premium account in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.
 
When any Group entity purchases the Company's equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company's equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company's equity holders. No gain or loss is recognised in the Income statement or Statement of Recognised Income and Expense on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
(P) BORROWINGS
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
(Q) INCOME TAX
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, on an undiscounted basis, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. The deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity. Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.
(R) EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Share-based payments
All share-based transactions are equity-settled.
The cost of these transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised as an expense in the income statement, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date when the employees become fully entitled to the shares "vesting date". The fair value is determined using a binomial valuation model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company (market conditions).
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest except for awards where the vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
The cumulative expense recognised for share option schemes at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that, in the opinion of the Directors of the Group and based on the best available estimate at that date, will ultimately vest. The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification. No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in the income statement for the award is expensed immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
Tax relief on share options is given when they are exercised; the relief given is based on the difference between the exercise price and the market price on the day of exercise. A deferred tax asset is calculated for outstanding share options based on the current share price at the end of each year and the related exercise price, and is built up over the vesting period of the options. The deferred tax asset is only recognised in the income statement for each share option scheme to the extent that a share-based payment expense has been charged in the income statement for that scheme. The remaining deferred tax asset calculated is recognised directly in equity.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption in IFRS 1 in respect of equity-settled awards so as to apply IFRS 2 only to those equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before 1 January 2005.
 
Holiday pay
Holiday to which an employee is entitled but has not taken at the end of the period is accrued for in the period to which it relates. This accrual builds up in the early part of the year and unwinds as the employee takes their entitlement.
(S) REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue comprises the fair value of the sale of goods and services, net of value-added tax and discounts, and after eliminating sales within the Group. Goods sold represent books, study texts, course notes, CDs and other published matter. Services provided include classroom tuition on a full and part time basis, lectures, client specific in-house courses and other tuition support. Revenue is recognised as follows:
Rendering of services
When the outcome of a transaction involving the rendering of services can be estimated reliably, revenue associated with the transaction is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date. Deferred revenue represents amounts invoiced for which the service will be provided in future periods.
Revenue is only recognised when the Group has performed all of its required obligations and when all the following conditions are satisfied: the revenue can be measured reliably; it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group; the stage of completion at the balance sheet date can be measured reliably; and the costs relating to the transaction can be measured reliably.
Sales of goods
Sales of goods are recognised when the Group has delivered goods to the customer; the customer has accepted the goods; and collectability of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
(T) INTEREST INCOME
Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues using the effective interest method.
(U) LEASES
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease incentives received are credited to trade and other payables on inception of the lease and are released evenly to the income statement over the life of the lease.
(V) DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION
Dividend distributions to the Company's shareholders are recognised as a reduction in reserves in the Group's financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company's shareholders.
(W) PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that there will be an outflow of economic benefits to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
(X) MINORITY INTEREST OPTIONS
On the acquisition of less than 100% of certain subsidiaries the Group enters into put and call options with the holders of the shares not owned by the Group, to purchase their interest at a later date.
These written put options are gross-settled (i.e. the entity pays cash or loan notes in return for the counterparty delivering shares), and hence are recognised as a financial liability at the present value of the amount payable. The liability recognised may be subject to a cap based on the individual agreements with the counterparties.
As the price under the option is calculated using a formula based on the previous audited full year profits, the financial liability is re-measured at each reporting date based on weighted average profits from the previous three years with any change in that value reflected in the income statement, as a finance charge or credit.
Where the put option is ultimately exercised, the amount recognised as the financial liability at that date will be extinguished by the payment of the exercise price. Goodwill is the net of consideration paid and the net assets purchased. Where the put option expires unexercised, the financial liability is derecognised and transferred back to equity.
(Y) NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS APPLIED
The Group has adopted IFRIC 11 IFRS 2  Group and Treasury Share Transactions insofar as it applies to consolidated financial statements. This interpretation requires arrangements whereby an employee is granted rights to an entity's equity instruments to be accounted for as an equity settled scheme, even if the entity buys the instruments from another party, or the shareholders provide the equity instruments needed. The Group has amended its accounting policy accordingly.
The Group has also adopted IFRIC 12  Service Concession Arrangements and IFRIC 14 IAS 19  The limit on a Defined Benefit Assets, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction and IAS 39  Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (Amendment).
The adoptions of the above interpretations and standard have had no impact on the Group financial statements.
 
(Z) NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS NOT APPLIED
The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date for annual periods beginning on or after the date of these financial statements:
Improvements to IFRSs
In May 2008 the Board issued its first omnibus of amendments to its standards, primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and clarifying wording. There are separate transitional provisions for each standard.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Group's financial statements in the period of initial application.
The standards and interpretations relevant to the Group for the year ending 31 December 2009 are discussed below:
IFRS 2 - Amendment to IFRS 2  Vesting Conditions and Cancellations
The amendment to IFRS 2 restricts the definition of a vesting condition to include only service conditions (requiring a specified period of service to be completed) and performance conditions (requiring the other party to achieve a personal goal or contribute to achieving a corporate target). All other features are non vesting conditions, and whereas a failure to achieve such a condition was previously regarded as a forfeiture (giving rise to a reversal of amounts previously charged to profit) it now must be reflected in the grant date fair value of the award and treated as a cancellation, which results in either an acceleration of the expected charge, or a continuation over the remaining vesting period, depending on whether the condition is under the control of the entity or counterparty. The revision is not expected to impact any of the Group's schemes except for the SAYE scheme. It will impact SAYE schemes as the removal of savings from the scheme by an employee before an option has vested will now become a cancellation rather than a forfeiture and the fair value of the options will need to be reviewed. This change is not expected to have a material impact on the Group.
IFRS 8 - Operating Segments
IFRS 8's core principle is that an entity should disclose information to enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the types of business activities in which it engages and the economic environments in which it operates. IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the entity that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in order to allocate resources to the segment and to assess its performance. In light of the restructuring of the Professional Education division in 2008, the Group is still considering the impact of adopting IFRS8 on the segment information presented in the financial statements.
IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements (Revised)
The revised Standard was issued in September 2007 and becomes effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The Standard separates owner and non-owner changes in equity. The statement of changes in equity will include only details of transactions with owners, with non-owner changes in equity presented as a single line. In addition, the Standard introduces the statement of comprehensive income: it presents all items of recognised income and expense, either in one single statement, or in two linked statements. The Group is still evaluating whether it will have one or two statements.
IAS 23 - Borrowing Costs (Revised)
A revised IAS 23  Borrowing Costs was issued in March 2007, and becomes effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The standard has been revised to require capitalisation of borrowing costs when such costs relate to a qualifying asset. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale. The Group already capitalises borrowing costs directly related to a qualifying asset therefore the adoption of this standard will have no impact on the Group results.
IAS 32 - Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements - Puttable Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation
These amendments to IAS 32 and IAS 1 were issued in February 2008 and become effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The revisions provide a limited scope exception for puttable instruments to be classified as equity if they fulfil a number of specified features. The amendments to the standards will have no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group, as the Group has not issued such instruments.
 
3 SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Group's primary reporting format is determined to be business segments as the Group's risks and rates of return are affected predominantly by differences in the products and services produced. Its secondary format is geographical segments.
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
The Professional Education segment is a supplier of training for Accountancy, Financial Services and Actuarial qualifications, and provides continuing professional development courses for professionally qualified people, together with general management training.
The BPP College segment is a supplier of training for Law, Business and Human Resources qualifications.
The MPW segment is an independent sixth form college, providing tuition for GCSE and A level qualifications.
Disclosure of HR Training has been moved from the Professional Education segment to the BPP College segment because management feel the products and services provided by this business are more aligned with the products and services provided by other businesses in the BPP College segment. Internal management reporting lines have been changed to reflect this.
The Group's geographical segments are determined by the location of the Group's assets and operations. Sales to external customers are disclosed in geographical segments which are based on the geographical location of the Group's customers.
Recharges between business segments are set in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. Segment revenue, segment expense and segment result include transfers between business segments. Those transfers are eliminated on consolidation.

11 TAXATION (A) TAX ON PROFIT FOR THE YEAR
(B) RECONCILIATION OF THE TOTAL TAX CHARGE The tax assessed for the period differs from the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK. The differences are explained below.
From 1 April 2008, the UK corporation tax rate was reduced from 30% to 28% resulting in the average corporation tax for the year being 28.5%. The deferred tax balance was adjusted in the prior year to reflect this change.
 
(C) DEFERRED TAX Deferred tax at 31 December relates to the following:
Disclosed in the balance sheet:
The deferred tax included in the Group income statement is as follows:
(D) UNRECOGNISED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS
The deferred tax asset, arising from the total losses of 1,544,000 incurred in the United States of America and Singapore has not been recognised. The business in Singapore was closed during 2005, with losses of 851,000.The business in the United States of America made a loss in 2008; it has retained losses of 693,000. The tax losses in the US can be carried forward up to 20 years, whilst tax losses in Singapore can be carried forward indefinitely.
12 EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding ordinary shares held by the BPP Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) and treasury shares.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. Options granted under Employee Share Schemes dilute the earnings per share by increasing the weighted average number of shares without changing net profit. Shares potentially issuable as consideration for the purchase of minority interests will change net profit because of the elimination of profit attributable to minority shareholders.
 
Account was not taken of the shares potentially issuable on the purchase of minority interests as these had an anti-dilutive impact on the earnings per share figures (2008: nil). 2008 is nil because the Minority Interest options for Actuarial Education Limited are not convertible to shares in BPP Holdings Plc.
13 DIVIDENDS PAID AND PROPOSED
The BPP Holdings Plc Employee Share Ownership Trust has waived the dividends payable on the shares held by it except for 0.0001p of any dividend due. At 31 December 2008 the Trust held 1,482,911 shares.
No dividends are payable on treasury shares. As at 31 December 2008 the Company held 2,154,854 treasury shares.
 
14 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Freehold land and buildings include 3,260,000 of interest capitalised in respect of loans to finance the acquisition and development of properties to the date of completion of development.
Assets under construction relates to IT hardware that is not yet in use.
15 INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Software in development relates to the investment in the major system upgrade. The assets predominantly relate to consultancy costs in respect of software development and software licences. The project is expected to be completed in June 2009, at which point the assets will be amortised over its useful economic life.
 
As the software in development is not yet being amortised, the asset has been reviewed for impairment. A cost benefit analysis has been performed to estimate the savings and revenue enhancements expected from the use of the asset over its expected useful economic life. The review confirmed that the recoverable amount is higher than its carrying value.
In January 2008, the Group acquired the remaining 10% of shares in BPP Nottingham Limited from the minority shareholders. The consideration of 81,000 was paid in cash. Goodwill of 52,000 was generated.
In April 2008, the Group acquired 1% of the issued share capital of BPP Actuarial Education Limited from the minority shareholders. The consideration of 94,000 was satisfied in loan notes (89,000) and cash (5,000). Goodwill of 87,000 was generated.
In April 2008, the Group acquired the remaining 25% of shares in BPP Cambridge Limited from the minority shareholders. The consideration of 683,000 was paid in cash. Goodwill of 577,000 was generated.
In April 2008, the Group acquired the remaining 10% of shares in BPP Maidstone Limited from the minority shareholders. The consideration of 315,000 was paid in cash. Goodwill of 254,000 was generated.
Minority interest put options are recognised in the balance sheet as a financial instrument in accordance with IAS 39 - Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Please refer to notes 22 and 28 for further details.
16 IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL
The total amount of goodwill acquired through business combinations and recognised at 31 December 2008 is allocated for impairment testing purposes to a single cash-generating unit (CGU), Professional Education, which is also a reportable segment. This represents the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The recoverable amount has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections based on the financial strategy of the segment as approved by the board covering a five year period. Cash flows beyond the five year budgeted period are extrapolated using a 2.0% growth rate. The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projection is 10%.
KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED IN VALUE IN USE CALCULATIONS
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the following assumptions:
Growth of market and market share  the value in use calculation assumes a modest growth scenario in respect of the professional examinations market, consistent with recent trends. The calculation also assumes that BPP will retain its market share in all of its relevant markets. The market for post qualification training, particularly in respect of City and Financial Services, is currently undergoing a period of softness, in line with the current economic cycle. This is factored into the calculation.
Selling price  it is assumed that the selling prices will remain at market or slightly above market level reflecting the premium of the BPP product.
Pre-tax discount rate  the pre-tax discount rate used is based on the Group's weighted average cost of capital, adjusted to reflect management's estimate of the risk profile for the relevant business.
SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS
Impairment analysis requires the use of certain future market assumptions and discount factors, which are subjective in nature. Estimated values can be affected by many factors beyond the Group's control such as business and economic trends, government regulation, etc. Changes in circumstances or conditions affecting applied assumptions could have a significant impact on the value in use and could then result in a material impairment charge to the Group's results.
With regard to the assessment of value in use of the group of cash generating units combined within the Professional Education segment, management believes that no reasonable possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its value in use. Management has considered the following sensitivities.
 
Growth of market and market share
Management has considered the impact of a variance in the growth of the market and market share. The value in use calculation shows that if both the assumed growth rates during the initial five year forecast period and the long-term growth rate were reduced to nil, the recoverable amount of the CGU would still be significantly greater than its carrying value.
Pre-tax discount rate
Management has considered the impact of an increase in the pre-tax discount rate applied to the calculation. The value in use calculation shows that if the pre-tax discount rate was increased to above 25%, the recoverable amount of the CGU would still be greater significantly than its carrying value.
17 INVESTMENTS
Investments are held at cost under the exemption available in IAS 39 in relation to unquoted equity instruments.
The Group holds a 50% interest in BPP Malta Limited and a 50% interest in BPP China Limited. The Group accounts for these interests as investments, as opposed to using the equity accounting method, because the Group does not have any influence over the financial or operating policies of these entities.
18 INVENTORIES
19 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
 
The carrying amounts of trade and other receivables approximate their fair value. Trade and other receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on 30-90 days' terms.
The Group's trade receivables are stated after allowances for bad and doubtful debts, an analysis of which is as follows:
As at 31 December, the ageing analysis of trade receivables is as follows:
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Group's customer base being large and unrelated. Management therefore believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the allowance for bad and doubtful debts.
The assessment of the impairment of trade receivables is based firstly on a review of individual balances for indicators of impairment such as late payments or clients under bankruptcy and secondly provisions are made where there is evidence of a risk of non-payment, taking into account ageing, previous experience and general economic conditions.
20 CASH AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSITS
Cash at bank earns interest at floating rates based on daily bank deposit rates. Short-term deposits are made for varying periods of between one day and three months depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group, and earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates.
For the purpose of the Group cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise the following at 31 December:
 
21 TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES
Terms and conditions of the above financial liabilities:
22 FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
Bank loans Bank loans comprise the following:
 
On 17 December 2008 the Group entered into a 30,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility. The expiry date of the facility is 28 November 2011 and incurs an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.375% to 1.625%.
30,000,000 variable rate loan
This unsecured loan is with The Royal Bank of Scotland. The loan is for seven years, repayable in one lump sum and is at an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 0.7% to 0.75%.
15,000,000 variable rate loan
This unsecured loan is with The Royal Bank of Scotland. The loan is repayable over 20 equal quarterly instalments (commenced 14 March 2006). The loan is at an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 0.65% to 0.70%.
Loan arrangement fees of 620,000 relating to these loans and credit facility are being amortised using the effective interest method over the period of the loan.
Following the acquisition by Apollo Global, Inc., all of the Group's outstanding bank loans became repayable on 31 October 2009 due to a change of control clause in the agreements. The 30m revolving credit facility (which was undrawn as at 31 December 2008) will also expire on the same date. The Group is in the process of refinancing these banking facilities but no agreement is in place as yet.
Other loans comprise loan notes issued in respect of the purchase of BPP Actuarial Education Ltd. During the year the loan note holders redeemed 110,000 of loan notes. These loan notes may be repaid in April or November of each year at the option of the loan note holders until 2024. The loan notes bear interest at the rate of six month LIBOR less a margin.
Minority interest options are options between the minority interest holders of subsidiary companies and the Group. The options require the Group to purchase a minority shareholding according to a contractual obligation. The liability represents the costs to the Group of buying out these minority interests should the put options be exercised by the minority shareholders. Refer to note 28 for additional information.
23 PROVISIONS
Property reorganisation
24 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Treasury activities are controlled and monitored by the Finance Director and are carried out in accordance with policies approved by the Board. The Chief Executive and the Finance Director have joint delegated authority to approve finance transactions within agreed frames of reference and levels of authority. The Group's principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans and overdrafts, other loans, leases, cash and short term deposits.
The purpose of the policies is to ensure that adequate cost effective funding is available to the Group and exposure to financial risk - interest rate, liquidity and currency risk - is minimised. Group policy permits the use of derivative instruments but only for reducing exposures arising from underlying business activity and not for speculative purposes. Derivatives (currently only interest rate swaps) and financial instruments are only entered into when there is a commercial justification and with counterparties which fulfil predetermined credit criteria.
INTEREST RATE RISK
The Group policy is to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations by keeping the Group's borrowings at a fixed rate, or within an acceptable range of fixed rates. At 31 December 2008 81.5% of the Group's debt was fixed through the use of interest rates swaps up to December 2009 or repayment date if earlier. The Group policy for deposits is to place funds with a variety of financial institutions chosen on the basis of credit rating and levels of return. Deposits are placed on fixed and variable rate terms of periods from overnight to six months based on cash flow forecasts and interest rate trends.
LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW RISKS
The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of its own resources, overdrafts, bank loans, revolving credit facilities and leases. The policy is to ensure that the Group has adequate committed bank facilities available and operates within its covenants.
 
The Group's cash flows are highly cyclical with cash requirement peaking just after June with large cash inflows in August and September. The Group uses committed bank facilities to manage short and long-term liquidity. As at 31 December 2008 the Group had available undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 30m, comprising a revolving credit facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland. As explained in Note 22, following the acquisition by Apollo Global Inc., this credit facility will expire on 31 October 2009. The facility agreement includes three financial covenants: PBIT: Borrowing Costs, Net Cash flow: Debt service liability and Gross Debt: EBITDA. The covenants take into account the planned investment in the Business School and ongoing major systems investment. Any non-compliance with the covenants underlying the Group's financing arrangements could, if not waived, constitute an event of default with respect to any such arrangements. The Group was in full compliance with its financial covenants throughout the period presented.
As part of the review of the Group's funding requirements which resulted in the new 30m revolving credit facility discussed above, management reviewed the level of headroom against the agreed covenants. This review confirmed continued compliance in the future.
As discussed in Note 22, Group is in the process of refinancing their banking facilities but no agreement is in place as yet. Apollo Group, Inc. has committed that in the event that BPP is unable to maintain its existing facilities with The Royal Bank of Scotland and is further unable to replace such credit agreements with third party financing with an equivalent aggregate loan amount, Apollo Group, Inc. will loan to BPP such funds, not to exceed the total aggregate loan amount under the current facilities, as are necessary to enable BPP and its subsidiaries to pay their debts as they become due for a period up to 31 March 2010.
Information regarding the contractual maturities of financial liabilities can be found in note 22 to the accounts.
The following tables illustrate the maturity profile of the anticipated future cash flows including interest for the financial liabilities of the Group as at 31 December. The maturity profile does not include the repayment of all outstanding bank loans on 31 October 2009 which were triggered under a change of control clause in the loan agreements. The cash flows are shown on an undiscounted basis which, therefore, differs from both the carrying value and fair value.
Year ended 31 December 2008
Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year.
 
Non interest bearing financial liabilities exclude accruals.
CREDIT RISK
The Group's credit risk arises from its cash and cash equivalents, short-term deposits, and outstanding receivables. In assessing and managing credit risk the Group sets authorised credit limits for new corporate customers based on an assessment of credit worthiness and on reports from third party credit checking agencies. A proactive approach identifies and manages bad and doubtful debts in respect of both corporate and individual customers.
The Group deposits its excess funds with The Royal Bank of Scotland. The Board deems this to be appropriate even given the current economic uncertainties.
The risk in respect of receivables is an unexpected loss in cash and earnings when the customer is unable to pay its obligations in due time.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group due to our large customer base. At 31 December 2008, the Group had approximately 4 customers that owed the Group more than 250,000 each and accounted for approximately 9% of all receivables owing. The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by their carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
The Group holds no collateral as security for any of its receivables.
CURRENCY RISKS
The receipts and payments of our overseas trading operations are largely in their local currency and therefore not hedged. The Group is subject to currency exposure on the translation of the profits and net assets of overseas subsidiaries. It is our policy not to hedge exposures arising from profit and net asset translation on consolidating overseas subsidiaries as these are not material to the Group; the Board keeps this policy under constant review. The main foreign currency in which the Group operates is the Euro.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Group defines capital as the total equity of the Group. The Group's objective for managing capital is to deliver competitive, secure and sustainable returns to maximise long-term shareholder value. BPP is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
The Group aims to maintain capital discipline in relation to investing activities while progressively growing the dividend per share. A high cash conversion ratio enables the Group to achieve this. There were no changes in the approach taken to capital management during the year.
In order to meet current and future obligations in respect of the Group's performance share plan, option and sharesave schemes, the Group purchases its own shares on the market. During the year the Group purchased 609,000 of its own shares in the market in order to improve its balance sheet efficiency. These shares are held in treasury.
The overall policy of the Board is to have a strong but efficient balance sheet. The Board ensures that it maintains an appropriate level of debt and therefore capital structure by the regular review of cash flow projections and monitoring key financial ratios; including gearing, net debt to EBITDA and interest cover.
The Board's current policy is to maintain the underlying ratio of net debt to EBITDA at less than 2:1 and the underlying interest cover at greater than 3:1. This policy will be reviewed in next few months to establish whether it is still appropriate following the acquisition by Apollo Global, Inc. (see note 34 for further details). The ratios for 2008 are as follows:
 
ANALYSIS OF TOTAL FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AND FINANCIAL ASSETS The tables below sets out the Group's IAS 39 classification for each of its financial assets and liabilities. All amounts are stated at their carrying value.
Year ended 31 December 2008
Derivative assets are all accounted for under cash flow hedges. Speculative positions are not undertaken.
FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all of the Group's financial instruments, that are carried in the financial statements.
Market values have been used to determine the fair value of the interest rate swap, borrowings and loan notes. The fair value of the put options on minority interests have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing market interest rates.
Other financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
 
HEDGES
Cash flow hedges On 24 February 2006 the Group entered into a new interest-rate swap arrangement with a notional amount of 30,000,000, whereby it pays a fixed rate of interest of 4.9825% and receives a variable rate equal to GBP-LIBOR-BBA (during the year this equated to the following rates; 7.2826% November 2007 to February 2008, 5.73875% February to May, 5.86688% June to August, 5.75313% September to November and 3.91000% November 2008 to February 2009) on the notional amount.
The swap is being used to fix the Group's 30m variable rate loan 2013 at a rate of 4.9825% plus the margin of 0.7% to 0.75%.
During 2006 the Group was party to two interest rate swap contracts designated as hedges of the expected future interest rate movements on the bank loans held by the Group. The fair value of the liability in respect of the original contracts at 1 January 2006 amounted to 533,000. These hedging instruments were derecognised on 24 February 2006 on termination of the arrangement and replaced with a new swap contract.
The outstanding liability on the previous arrangement was rolled into the new contract and is now being recognised based on the effectiveness of the new hedge. This resulted in a "pay fixed" rate, which was approximately 5% higher than market rate, which at the time of entering into the transaction was approximately 4.5%. The ineffectiveness of the hedge will be recognised through the income statement.
The swap is accounted for at fair value through equity. At the balance sheet date the fair value of the hedging instrument is a liability of 2,273,000.
The swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge and is used to hedge against the future cashflow impact of changes in the interest rate being charged on the loan. Cash flows occur on an annual basis, or on the maturity date of the interest rate (currently quarterly; 28 February, 31 May, 31 August, 30 November) with profit or loss on the hedging instrument calculated on a six monthly basis.
The amount recognised directly in equity in the year ended 31 December 2008 in respect of the current arrangement amounted to 2,480,000.
The terms of these contracts are as follows:
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Interest rate risk IFRS7 requires a sensitivity analysis that shows the impact on the Income Statement and on items recognised directly in equity of hypothetical changes of interest rates in respect of financial assets and liabilities of the Group. All other variables are held constant although, in practice, market rates rarely change in isolation. The Group considers a 100 basis point change in interest rates a reasonably possible change.
The Group has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the estimated change to the income statement and equity of a 1% (100 basis points) difference in market interest rates applicable at 31 December 2008.
The sensitivity analysis includes the following assumptions:
 
25 AUTHORISED AND ISSUED SHARE CAPITAL
On 6 October 2008, BPP Holdings Plc purchased 50,000 of its own ordinary shares at 443.00p, on 8 October 2008 a further 150,000 shares were purchased at a price of 441.00p and on 9 October 2008 a further 409,000 shares were purchased at a price of 440.12p. These shares continue to be held as treasury shares at the date of signing the balance sheet.
Further, during the year, BPP Holdings Plc purchased 835,000 of its own shares for 4,333,000. These are held by the ESOT to satisfy the future exercise of options under the Group's share option schemes.
There were no new shares issued during 2008.
The total proceeds from the exercise of share options under the Executive Share Option Schemes was 194,735.
The total proceeds from the exercise of share options under the savings related share option scheme was 357,776.
As at 31 December 2008 options existed under the Company's share option schemes as set out below.
At 31 December 2008, 1,482,911 ordinary shares of the Company were held in an independently managed ESOT, formed to meet future and current obligations under the Company's share incentive schemes.
 
26 RECONCILIATION OF MOVEMENTS IN EQUITY
Included in the Group's retained earnings is an amount of 13,692,000 representing retained earnings which is not distributable due to statutory restrictions.
SHARE PREMIUM
This reserve records the consideration premium for shares issued at a value that exceeds their nominal value.
CAPITAL REDEMPTION RESERVE
The capital redemption reserve represents the nominal value of the Company's own shares that have been purchased for cancellation as part of the share buy-back. The amounts included in this reserve represent transfers from the Company's share capital account.
TRANSLATION RESERVE
The translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries.
ESOT & TREASURY SHARES
The BPP Employee Share Ownership Trust (the ESOT) was established in 1996 with the purpose, inter alia, of holding shares in the Company to satisfy grants of options by the Company. The market value of the shares held by the ESOT at 31 December 2008 was 4,857,000 and the nominal value was 148,000.
 
Treasury shares represent BPP shares repurchased and available for issue. At 31 December 2008 the Company held 2,154,854 treasury shares.
OTHER RESERVES
Other reserves records movements in cash flow hedges (including the related deferred tax) and the buy out of minority share options.
At 31 December 2008, the cumulative fair value loss in respect of cash flow hedges was 2,019,000.
During the period, the Group bought out further minority interests in a number of businesses. A total of 1,173,000 in cash and loan notes was paid during the year. The minorities' share of net assets at the date of acquisition was 203,000 leaving 970,000 to be treated as goodwill.
27 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEME
The Group has an employee share ownership trust (ESOT) for the granting of non-transferable options to certain key members of staff and Executive Directors. Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under the option at the grant date. There are four Executive Share Option Schemes run by the Company.
In 1996 two Executive Share Option Schemes were set up, one approved by the Inland Revenue and the other operated as an unapproved scheme. The contractual lives of the options held within the approved and unapproved schemes are ten years and seven years from the date of grant respectively. In both the approved and unapproved schemes the options become exercisable on the third anniversary of the grant of the option subject to the growth in an adjusted earnings per share measure over any three year period exceeding the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index (RPI) plus 3% per annum. Following the adoption of the new Executive Share Option Scheme in 2003 no further options can be granted under the 1996 scheme.
In 2003 two Executive Share Option Schemes were set up, one approved by the Inland Revenue and the other operated as an unapproved scheme. The contractual life of the option is ten years from the date of grant and the options become exercisable on the third anniversary of the grant of the option subject to the growth in an adjusted earnings per share measure over the period exceeding the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index (RPI) plus 3% per annum. Exercise of options is subject to continued employment.
The following table illustrates the number (No.) and weighted average exercise price (WAEP) of share options for the ESOT.
 
For share options exercised under the Executive Share Option Scheme during the period the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 5.05.
The weighted average remaining contractual life for the share options outstanding as at 31 December 2008 is 6.7 years.
Share options outstanding at the end of the year are set out in note 25.
PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN (PSP)
This plan involves the award of share awards to participants subject to a non-market performance condition (EPS).
The contractual life of the awards is three years. They become exercisable on the third anniversary of the grant of the award, subject to the growth in normalised earnings per share over the period exceeding the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index (RPI) plus between 5% and 20% per annum (awarded on a sliding scale). The 2007 scheme is based on an adjusted earning per share measure rather than normalised earnings per share. Exercise of awards is subject to continued employment.
 
The fair value of awards under the PSP is calculated using the market value of shares at the time of the award and excludes the impact of dividends.
The weighted average remaining contractual life for the share awards outstanding as at 31 December 2008 is 1.9 years.
The weighted average fair value of shares issued under the PSP during the year was 4.85.
SHARE MATCHING SCHEME
Under the share matching plan (SMP) from 2009 onwards, Executive Directors will be required to defer half of their gross annual bonus in respect of the previous financial year (up to a maximum of 25% of base salary, or 37.5% of base salary for the Chief Executive) as an investment in ordinary shares in the Company. In the event that the deferred amount is less than 25% of the Executive Director's annual base salary, they may voluntarily defer a further proportion of their gross bonus or invest further funds from their own external resources to make up all or a proportion of that shortfall. The Chief Executive, in addition to the deferred proportion of his gross annual bonus, may voluntarily defer a further proportion of his gross bonus or invest further funds from his own external resources so that the annual total value of shares qualifying for matching under the SMP may be up to 250,000. The aggregate amount will then be invested into ordinary shares in the Company.
In return, those shares will have the potential to earn "matching shares" in proportion to the amount invested. The number of "matching shares" that the Executive Directors will be entitled to will depend on the total shareholder return ("TSR") of the Company over a three year performance period. For the awards, the following schedule will be used:
For the first awards under the SMP made during 2008, as an interim arrangement only, Executive Directors have been invited to participate in the SMP on a voluntary basis.
a) On 1 May 2008, 23,562 investment share awards were awarded in lieu of bonuses. The contractual life of the awards is three years and they become exercisable on the third anniversary of the grant of the option. As the investment share awards have no performance conditions attached, and carry an entitlement to dividends paid during the vesting period, the fair value of the awards is equal to the current market value of the shares on the grant date (5.04). During the year the Chief Executive purchased 36,400 shares from his own funds. These are not treated as investment shares in the table below but are eligible for the matching awards.
b) On 1 May 2008, 119,924 matching share awards were awarded. The contractual life of the awards is three years and the awards become exercisable on the third anniversary of the grant date, subject to the growth in absolute total shareholder return (a market based condition) over the performance period. Exercise of the awards is subject to continued employment. The fair value of the award is calculated using the binomial model, adjusted for the likelihood of achieving the market based condition. Participants are not entitled to receive the value of dividends that are paid during the vesting period.
 
The following table illustrates the number (No.) of share awards for the share matching plan shares.
SAVINGS RELATED SHARE OPTION SCHEME
The Group also operates a savings related share option scheme (Sharesave) that is open to all employees of the Group within the UK. Options are issued at a discount of 15% of the share price on the pricing day (approximately one month prior to the grant date) and are exercisable three years after they are issued. Exercise of the option is subject to continued employment and the scheme leaver provisions.
The following table illustrates the number (No.) and weighted average exercise price (WAEP) of share options for the Sharesave.
For share options exercised under the Sharesave during the period the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 3.64.
The weighted average remaining contractual life for the share options outstanding as at 31 December 2008 is 2.3 years.
The fair values of the Sharesave plans and share matching share awards have been estimated at the date of grant using the binomial model. The following table gives the assumptions used in valuing the grant of options/awards made during the periods.
The expected life of the options/awards is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The total charge for the year relating to employee share based payment plans was 1,143,000 all of which related to equity settled share-based payment transactions.
 
28 MINORITY INTERESTS
 
It is the Board's current intention to use cash where possible to purchase minority interests.
29 CAPITAL COMMITMENTS
Amounts contracted but not provided for in the financial statements amounted to 1,349,000.
Amounts authorised but not contracted for amounted to 1,860,000.

34 POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
On 30 July 2009, Apollo UK Acquisition Company Limited completed the acquisition of the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of BPP Holdings plc for a cash purchase price of 620 pence per share. Apollo UK Acquisition Company Limited is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apollo Global, Inc., which is a majority-owned subsidiary of Apollo Group, Inc. As a result of the acquisition, BPP Holdings plc delisted from the London Stock Exchange in August 2009.
Following the acquisition by Apollo Global, Inc., all of the Group's outstanding bank loans became repayable on 31 October 2009 due to a change of control clause in the agreements. The 30m revolving credit facility (which was undrawn as at 31 December 2008) will also expire on the same date. The Group is in the process of refinancing these banking facilities but no agreement is in place as yet.
Further, as a result of the takeover, all outstanding share options and awards vested on the acquisition date. All of the Executive Share Options Scheme, Performance Share Plan and Share Matching Scheme awards were exercised on the date of acquisition. The Save As You Earn scheme options can be exercised up to six months after the acquisition date. The impact of these subsequent changes has not been quantified as of this time.
As a result of the acquisition it was decided to write down the value of the intangible assets categorised as software in development in note 15 to 750,000. This is due to the expectation that the Group will suspend the development of its own IT systems and use systems provided by Apollo Group, Inc.

Note 1. Basis of Pro Forma Presentation
On July 30, 2009, Apollo Global, Inc. ("Apollo Global"), through a wholly-owned United Kingdom subsidiary Apollo UK Acquisition Company Limited, acquired the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of BPP Holdings plc ("BPP"), a company registered in England and Wales, for a cash purchase price of 620 pence per share. Apollo UK Acquisition Company Limited is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apollo Global, which is a majority-owned subsidiary of Apollo Group, Inc. ("Apollo Group"). BPP is a provider of education and training to professionals in the legal and finance industries and the BPP College of Professional Studies is the first proprietary institution to have been granted degree awarding powers in the United Kingdom.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been derived from the historical consolidated financial statements of Apollo Group and BPP. The historical consolidated financial statements of BPP presented in Exhibit 99.3 herein have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. In the preparation of the pro forma condensed combined financial information, we did not identify any accounting differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP accounting standards that would require a significant adjustment to BPP's historical consolidated financial statements and thus no adjustments have been reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included herein reflects the following:
For purposes of presenting the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, the historical consolidated income statement information of BPP was translated into U.S. dollars using an exchange rate of 1.00 = $2.00435 for the twelve months ended June 30, 2008 and for the nine months ended June 30, 2009, using an exchange rate of 1.00 = $1.52126. These exchange rates represent the average exchange rate for each respective period. The historical consolidated balance sheet information of BPP at June 30, 2009 was translated into U.S. dollars using an exchange rate of 1.00 = $1.6520, representing the exchange rate on June 30, 2009.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or financial position had the acquisition been consummated at the beginning of the period presented, nor is it necessarily indicative of the results of operations in future periods or the future financial position of the combined entities.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, giving effect to the acquisition of BPP by Apollo Group as if the acquisition had occurred as of the beginning of the earliest period presented. The purchase price was preliminarily allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values.
We have presented the purchase price summary and preliminary purchase price allocation as of the following dates:
 
A summary of the purchase price is as follows:
A summary of the preliminary purchase price allocation is as follows:
The acquisition resulted in goodwill that is primarily attributable to potential strategic and financial benefits expected to be realized associated with future student growth and access to new markets.
A summary of the identifiable intangible assets acquired and estimated useful lives, based on our preliminary purchase price allocation, is as follows:
The acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized using either an accelerated method to reflect the economic useful life of the asset or on a straight-line basis.
The purchase price allocations are preliminary and subject to revision as we finalize the valuation of intangible assets, property and equipment and as additional information about the fair value of other assets and liabilities becomes available. We expect our analysis to be completed within the allocation period allowed under SFAS No. 141.
 
Note 2. Reclassifications
Certain amounts in BPP's historical consolidated balance sheet have been reclassified to conform to Apollo Group's classification and presentation. These reclassifications primarily relate to the following:
Note 3. Pro Forma Adjustments
The following pro forma adjustments have been reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. All adjustments are based on current assumptions and valuations which are subject to change. The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared as if the acquisition had been completed on September 1, 2007 (beginning of the registrant's fiscal year 2008) for statement of income purposes and at May 31, 2009 (the end of the registrant's third quarter of fiscal year 2009) for balance sheet purposes.
Balance sheet pro forma adjustments were translated into U.S. Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.00 = $1.6520 on June 30, 2009. Statement of income pro forma adjustments were translated into U.S. Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.00 = $1.99081 for the twelve months ended August 31, 2008 and using an exchange rate of 1.00 = $1.53968 for the nine months ended May 31, 2009. These exchange rates represent the average exchange rate for each respective period.

Note 4. Disclosure of Omitted Period Results
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income do not contain BPP's operating results for the period between July 1, 2008 and September 30, 2008. BPP's revenues and net income (loss) for this period were $64.2 million and ($3.9) million, respectively. There were no unusual charges or adjustments recorded during this omitted period. BPP's operating results for this period were translated into U.S. dollars using an exchange rate of 1.00 = $1.89688 for the three months ended September 30, 2008, which represents the average exchange rate for the period.

The following exhibit is furnished herewith:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
Phoenix, Arizona, October 27, 2009  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or the "Company") today reported financial results for the three months and fiscal year ended August 31, 2009.
"We are pleased to report another quarter of excellent financial and operating performance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009," said Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer Chas Edelstein. "We continue to focus on enhancing the student experience and delivering quality academic programs that are relevant to today's working learner. The combination of these efforts is being recognized in the marketplace and resulted in solid enrollments and continued improvement in the retention of our current students."
Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer and Apollo Global Chairman Greg Cappelli added, "We also continue to execute on our strategy by investing to maximize the value of the University of Phoenix, including a focus on our admissions process to more effectively reach students who retain at higher rates, while expanding intelligently both domestically and globally as evidenced by our acquisition of BPP, which closed during the fourth quarter. We believe that a superior student experience, enabled by our talented and engaged faculty and staff and education-based technology innovations, will result in long-term value for our shareholders."
Unaudited Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2009 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the three months ended August 31, 2009, totaled $1,075.8 million, which represents a 29.4% increase over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Contributing to the growth in the fourth quarter was a 22.3% year-over-year increase in University of Phoenix total Degreed Enrollment to 443,000. The Company reported net income for the three months ended August 31, 2009, of $91.5 million, or $0.59 per share (155.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to net income of $229.6 million, or $1.43 per share (160.1 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended August 31, 2008.
The fiscal 2009 fourth quarter results contain special items totaling pre-tax charges of $95.4 million ($69.4 million net of tax), including an accrual for an estimated litigation settlement of $80.5 million, a $9.4 million write-off of information technology fixed assets that resulted primarily from the Company's rationalization of software, a $5.5 million charge, net of minority interest, representing the option premium for a currency hedge in connection with Apollo Global's acquisition of BPP Holdings plc ("BPP") and a discrete charge to the income tax provision of $4.7 million due to the write-off of a deferred tax asset as a result of certain disallowed deductions associated with share-based compensation related to options exercised by
1
 
an executive during the fourth quarter. Included in the fiscal 2008 fourth quarter results is a reversal of a previously-accrued litigation loss associated with a securities matter of $170.0 million when the earlier judgment was vacated, as well as a $9.5 million gain from a third party's forfeiture of an escrow deposit in connection with a now-cancelled agreement to sell and lease back the Company's headquarters buildings.
Excluding these special items, net income for the three months ended August 31, 2009, was $165.6 million, or $1.06 per share, compared to net income of $120.5 million, or $0.75 per share for the three months ended August 31, 2008. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, BPP's operations contributed $13.1 million to revenue and reduced earnings per share by approximately $0.03. Apollo Global completed the acquisition of BPP, a UK-based provider of education and training mainly to professionals in the legal and finance industries on July 30, 2009. The final purchase price for BPP was $602 million.
On September 30, 2009, University of Phoenix, a subsidiary of Apollo Group, Inc., confirmed that it has entered into settlement discussions with plaintiffs to resolve the Incentive Compensation False Claims Act litigation pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California. There is no assurance that a settlement will be reached. Pending the outcome of these discussions, University of Phoenix and the plaintiffs jointly requested a stay of all litigation proceedings for 45 days, which was granted on October 2, 2009. In connection with this matter, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $80.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 which is the Company's best estimate of the loss to be incurred in connection with this matter, including associated expenses.
Instructional costs and services increased by $90.6 million, or 25.0% to $452.9 million for the three months ended August 31, 2009, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2008. As a percentage of net revenue, instructional costs and services declined 150 basis points to 42.1% versus 43.6% in the prior year's fourth quarter. The reduction, as a percentage of revenue, was greater when excluding the impact of BPP's operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The improvement was predominantly due to University of Phoenix continuing to leverage its fixed costs, such as certain wages, classroom space and depreciation expense. University of Phoenix has grown its headcount at a slower rate than the increase in net revenue. The Company also benefited from savings due to lower negotiated contract costs in financial aid processing and other areas. This was partially offset by higher expenses at Apollo Global associated with its start-up, development and other infrastructure and support costs for the Company's international operations, as well as, a 120 basis point increase to 4.2%, as a percentage of net revenue, in bad debt expense versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. The increase in bad debt expense is primarily due to the increased risk of collecting aged receivables and lower collection rates on those receivables given the current economic downturn.
Selling and promotional expenses increased by $39.4 million, or 17.6%, to $262.5 million for the three months ended August 31, 2009, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2008. As a percentage of net revenue, selling and promotional expenses declined 240 basis points to 24.4% versus 26.8% in the prior year's fourth quarter. The reduction, as a percentage of
2
 
revenue, was slightly less when excluding the impact of BPP's operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The improvement was mainly a result of continued improvement in enrollment counselor effectiveness at University of Phoenix. Additionally, investments in marketing resulted in more effective and efficient advertising. The Company continues to invest in marketing to build greater brand identity as well as to drive and support future enrollment growth.
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses increased by $41.3 million, or 86.0%, to $89.3 million, for the three months ended August 31, 2009, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2008. As a percentage of net revenue, G&A expenses increased 250 basis points to 8.3% versus 5.8% in the prior year's fourth quarter. The increase is mainly attributable to the $9.4 million fixed asset write-off, discussed previously, and a lesser amount of compensation expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, related to the departure of certain senior executives. BPP's operations had little impact on G&A expenses as a percentage of net revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
The Company's effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was 52.2%. The increase versus a year ago is principally attributable to higher state tax rates; the potential tax impact of the qui tam lawsuit settlement, which may not be fully deductible; and the write-off of the deferred tax assets discussed previously.
Financial and Operating Metrics
Below are Apollo Group's unaudited financial data and operating metrics for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 versus the prior year period.
3
 
 
2009 Fiscal Year End Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2009, was $4.0 billion, a 26.5% increase over fiscal 2008. Contributing to this increase was a 20.8% increase in University of
4
 
Phoenix's average Degreed Enrollment for fiscal 2009 as compared with fiscal 2008. University of Phoenix's combined New Degreed Enrollment for fiscal 2009 increased 23.5% as compared with fiscal 2008.
The Company reported net income of $598.3 million, or $3.75 per share, (159.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), and $476.5 million, or $2.87 per share, (165.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for fiscal years 2009 and 2008, respectively. Excluding the special items described previously, net income for fiscal 2009 was $672.4 million, or $4.22 per share, as compared to net income of $470.7 million, or $2.84 per share for fiscal 2008. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of August 31, 2009, the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash, totaled $987.8 million as compared to $511.5 million as of August 31, 2008. The increase is primarily attributable to cash generated from operations as well as borrowings of the entire credit line under the Company's $500 million credit facility, partially offset by share repurchases and funds used in Apollo Global's acquisition of BPP. Restricted cash and student deposits increased by approximately $48.1 million and $78.3 million, respectively, compared to August 31, 2008, respectively. These increases were primarily due to increased student enrollment and to increases in Title IV funds available to students.
At August 31, 2009, accounts receivable increased to $298.3 million from $221.9 million at August 31, 2008. Excluding accounts receivable and the associated revenue for Apollo Global, the Company's days sales outstanding ("DSO") increased to 32 days at August 31, 2009, as compared to 29 days at August 31, 2008. The increase in DSO is due to both temporary as well as structural changes to the Company's operations. Temporary items include the timing of the billing cycle relative to year-end, and a more pronounced seasonal increase due to the Company's annual student financial aid system enhancements and upgrades, which temporarily postpones the processing of student financial aid requests resulting in a delay of corresponding disbursements of Title IV loan proceeds. Additionally, University of Phoenix has implemented certain operational changes that cause an increase in the Company's accounts receivable balance and DSO calculation.
Goodwill increased by $436.4 million to $522.4 million at August 31, 2009, from $86.0 million at August 31, 2008, and intangible assets, net, increased by $180.6 million to $203.7 million at August 31, 2009, from $23.1 million at August 31, 2008. These increases were primarily due to Apollo Global's acquisition of BPP in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
Total deferred revenue at August 31, 2009, increased to $333.0 million from $231.2 million at August 31, 2008. The increase is principally due to increased student enrollment as well as Apollo Global's acquisition of BPP.
Total debt outstanding (including short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt) increased by $558.2 million to $589.1 million at August 31, 2009, from $30.9 million at August 31, 2008. The increase is mainly due to borrowings of the entire credit line under the
5
 
Company's $500 million credit facility, along with debt assumed in the BPP acquisition. Subsequent to fiscal year end, the Company has repaid approximately $393 million of its borrowings on its credit facility.
Securities and Exchange Commission Informal Inquiry
The Company announced that the Enforcement Division of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has commenced an informal inquiry into the Company's revenue recognition practices. Based on the information that has been disclosed to Apollo Group, the scope, duration and outcome of the inquiry cannot be determined at this time. The Company intends to cooperate fully with the SEC in connection with the inquiry.

Exhibit 99.1
PHOENIX, December 7, 2009  In acknowledgement of the need to produce greater accountability and transparency throughout higher education, Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:APOL) subsidiary University of Phoenix today announced key findings from its second Academic Annual Report, demonstrating the University's continued progress in addressing the challenges facing higher education today and calling for greater understanding of the country's next generation of students, who are increasingly different from generations past. Recognizing the Obama administration's ambitious goals to address the nation's educated workforce shortage and the economic crisis, the Report explores how best to serve the growing contingent of talented, hardworking people who want to better themselves, but find they are shut out of higher education because of their real-life responsibilities  a group that comprises 73 percent of college students today.
"These nontraditional students represent the next generation of learners," said Dr. William J. Pepicello, president of University of Phoenix. "They are not just students, they are students. Understanding their needs and motivations and what systems will be necessary to serve them is critical if we, as a nation, are to produce the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020."

America's
Key Findings
 
 
Comparisons
In a comparison of findings between its 2008 and 2009 reports, cautioning that two years cannot adequately point to significant trends, University of Phoenix reported slightly higher rates of student satisfaction this year over last. In the area of information literacy, results showed that scores for seniors continued to increase over those reported for freshman at approximately the same rate.
University of Phoenix acknowledged a slight decrease in academic progress and progression, although the overall comparison between its students and their contemporaries was comparable because the variance in scores measured by the standard deviation was much greater than the decrease reported this year. Completion rates for the University showed a slight decline  1 percentage point for associate, 2 percentage points for baccalaureate and 5 percentage points for graduate  in students graduating within 150 percent of the traditional time for degree completion.
"In areas where comparisons can be made and declines were found  no matter how slight  University of Phoenix has initiated thoughtful and critical analysis as to the possible reasons for the changes and developed programs for continuous improvement," said Pepicello.
The University is currently exploring possible reasons for the slight decline in completion rates. Specifically, it is examining the demographics of next generation learners and how this unique student population learns. Important factors in this analysis will include age, previous academic experience, transfer credits and preference for learning modality.
Continuous Improvement
In response to data gathered to this point, University of Phoenix has determined specific areas to be addressed, with a focus on programs for orientation, a refined approach to introductory courses and a just-in-time plan for remediation. University Orientation, currently in trial with a small sub-set of the University's student population, upon introduction will be a three-week, non-credit bearing, free orientation course required for all students entering with fewer than 24 credits prior to their enrollment with the University. The new program is intended to address the skills necessary to be successful at University of Phoenix, and will introduce new students to the format, expectations and requirements of the environment in which they will be learning.
 
"The orientation program will encourage prospective students to take personal responsibility for their learning and help them make informed decisions about whether this is the type of institution they wish to attend and if they are ready to do so," said Pepicello. "It will afford prospective students the opportunity to experience the rigors of the college classroom without financial burden, so that those who discover they are not ready will not incur debt."
From there, it is anticipated that all students entering with fewer than 24 credits will be required to take a customized sequence of courses designed to increase retention and promote success for at-risk students. The First-Year Sequence has been designed in four blocks with the student at the center. Each block will build upon, reinforce and recycle the academic skills introduced in the previous blocks. Course content will be interrelated to reinforce content and skill-building mastered in each course, laddering material taught over multiple courses.
"In this way, it is expected that students will learn and retain more information than if they were learning everything in one course, without a grounding context," explained Pepicello.
Lastly and also as part of the First-Year Sequence, University of Phoenix is changing its approach to remediation and instituting a program of integrative learning, which will provide just-in-time skills on a gradual basis. This innovative approach will make learning opportunities available to students throughout their course of study, not just at the beginning and not in an all-in-one, sink-or-swim course.
"We are changing remedial education to work for all students when they need it and without sacrificing their appropriate academic progression," said Pepicello.

Exhibit 99.2
"Now, just as we've opened the doors of college to every American, we also have to ensure that more students can walk through them. That's why I've challenged every American to commit to at least one year of higher education or advanced training, because, by the end of the next decade, I want to see America have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world."
President Barack Obama
 
 
 
 
Today the University is a comprehensive learning institution enrolling approximately 443,000 students, with a faculty of more than 27,000, and more than 500,000 alumni.
 
The Mission of the University of Phoenix is to provide access to higher education opportunities that enable students to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to achieve their professional goals, improve the productivity of their organizations, and provide leadership and service to their communities.
However, the economic and demographic landscape of the United States has seen considerable shifts in the more than 30 years of the University's existence. As a result, the focus of higher education must shift accordingly to meet a new set of challenges. America's workforce stands at a crossroads: For the first time in history, the next generation is in danger of being less educated than the generation before. The impending retirement of the baby boomer generation will create a gap in the supply of highly skilled professionals a gap that we will not be able to fill unless we increase access to higher education.

The immensity of the problem will require both public and

equal attention should be given to those students in at-risk groups who succeed. Lessons can be learned from them and the institution's services and processes can be refined and restructured accordingly. In a 1997 study of at-risk, minority students, the authors identified two kinds of knowledge vital to student outcomes. "The first was the theoretical knowledge taught in formal programs; the second was local, heuristic knowledge learned experientially and culturally." The authors noted (as have others) that those at-risk students who did succeed were those who became experts at going to school at their chosen institution. Thus, the researchers concluded that "institutions should do more to identify, honor, and provide for the acquisition of local, heuristic knowledge." In addition, the study notes that, "students must acquire a certain amount of heuristic, or practical, knowledge that is necessary to function competently on campus."

Studies have shown that at-risk students, in particular, have a need for courses early in their college experience that are clearly relevant to their current lives, the workplace, and their future goals. The at-risk or inexperienced students need methods of connecting coursework to things that are familiar and important in their lives. If students can fuse new information to their existing knowledge, they experience a sense of accomplishment and the short-term successes that are important to retention.
The Challenge of Diversity
According to a report completed by the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, one in five heads of households is either foreign-born or a first generation American. "At the same time, the numbers of nontraditional' households unmarried couples, female householders, and singles of all types are growing rapidly, especially among the native-born white population."Historically, most of these households have

lower incomes and generally lower rates of college attendance.
As a result, the American public tends to dismiss decreased attainment in higher education in this country to the melting-pot nature of the pool of college enrollees. However, according to the Alliance of Excellent Education, this misconception is based on the idea that other countries achieve better college attainment rates per capita than the United States because they have small, homogeneous college enrollments. While that student population is usually easier to educate because their needs, academic achievement levels, and expectations are similar, these countries do not necessarily serve
8
only a small, homogeneous group. According to the Alliance, "data show that many countries' schools successfully assimilate immigrant or high-poverty populations that are proportionately larger than those in the United States. American schools, on the other hand, do little to mitigate the barriers that these groups face." According to the Fact Sheet issued by the Alliance for Excellent Education, , "Finland and the Netherlands are the undisputed success stories of the survey in terms of accessibility and affordability. Both have large student bodies, high attainment rates, extensive grant programs, and student bodies that are reasonably reflective of broader society."
9
How Does the United States Stack Up? International Comparisons of Academic Achievement
 
This last point is salient if used as a lens for examining America's higher education system. Traditional colleges and universities, even public state institutions, use a set of admissions requirements that define the student body of those institutions. In fact, by and large these admissions requirements define the 27 percent of potential undergraduate students that are served by these institutions. For that reason, traditional students can be served well by these institutions. That is, if admissions requirements are a de facto profile of incoming students, then academic and support systems can be aligned to their needs. However, as noted, increasingly, the majority of incoming students in America do not meet traditional admissions profiles. Nonetheless, most of higher education continues to function as if they do. And in doing so we fail the growing number of non-traditional students.
The trend in higher education in the United States and in the rest of the world will be a continued increase in student diversity both in ethnicity and age, which will increase the number of non-traditional student enrollments. According to a report by published in June 2009, "at some point, probably just after 2020, minority students will outnumber whites on college campuses for the first time." In addition, the average age of students will continue to rise as more and more people realize the need for additional credentials due to changing technology and a requirement for lifelong learning. The report concludes that, at this time, "The colleges that are doing the best right now at capturing that demographic are community colleges and for-profit institutions."

Reconsidering Remediation
While most of the country and the Obama administration recognize the need for expanded opportunities in higher education, a dilemma exists that cannot be ignored if we are to meet the goal of returning the United States as the global academic and economic leader.
It has been reported that more than 90 percent of all high school seniors expect to continue their education beyond high school. The stumbling block to their success is not simply whether there will be institutions that can meet the demand, but rather whether the typical American high school graduate is ready for the rigors of continuing his or her education.
The facts are that only about one-third of all high school seniors (including those who expect to continue their education) are prepared to do so. Despite efforts by local school districts, state legislators, and the federal government in the form of the standardized achievement tests and the No Child Left Behind Act, high schools across the country continue to graduate students who lack basic academic proficiency in many areas. The 2007 America Competes Act set a goal to reduce,
"It's one thing to blame the K-12 system when a 19-year-old freshman can scarcely write and do math, but quite another when the student in the remedial' course is 38 years old..."
Fordham Institute
and even eliminate, the need for remediation. The current cost of remedial education is staggering. Conservative estimates are that public colleges alone spend one to two billion annually on remedial education programs. Estimates are that at least half of all students entering college today are required to take some remedial courses prior to starting their college courses. The costs for this are not only incurred by the taxpayers, but also by students who must pay for these non-credit bearing remedial courses. In addition to
12
 
the immediate financial considerations, the opportunity cost for the students are high as well; enrolling in remedial courses extends the time-to-degree completion and thereby limits the students' earning power during the lost time.
To address this issue appropriately, it is important to examine the true purpose of remediation. Is the goal of remedial education short-term immersion to identify students who have not mastered all the linguistic or mathematics skills and bring them up to speed in one or two inclusive, sink-or-swim courses? If so, then it should be eliminated because it is not working.
All students needing academic assistance are not fresh out of high school. Many students are older students who have stopped out, are recareering, have served in the armed forces, or are perhaps not native-English speakers. They may have mastered the necessary skills at one time, but now need to revisit and refresh the topics. Raising high school standards will not necessarily assist these students, and certainly eliminating remedial education will not serve them well. Once again, that puts the focus on the 27 percent of traditional students, while the needs of the majority the Next Generation Learners who do not go directly from high school to college, are not addressed.
The Call for Accountability and Transparency
As the importance of higher education to the well being of the country becomes evident, there is keen interest in what institutions of higher education are doing. Are students getting what they are paying for? Are institutions actually teaching the students? Are institutions using taxpayer and benefactor monies wisely to the benefit of the students and the country? How are they doing this and can they prove they are accomplishing these things? Two years ago in the Spellings Report, , the authors challenged higher education "to produce a robust culture of accountability and transparency throughout higher education."
A Test of Leadership: Charting the Future of U.S. Higher Education
13
To date, there have been a variety of responses to that challenge. Institutions implemented websites and created joint information portals; the Minnesota state colleges and universities system instituted a statewide electronic portfolio infrastructure; and the University of Phoenix began issuing the Academic Annual Report. These efforts are a good start, but all of education (higher education as well as the K-12 system) has a great deal of work to do to dispel the public's perception that what goes on inside the classroom stays in the classroom. More and more people believe they should have a stake in defining the metrics of excellence for education.
14
15
To change to a more accountable system, one that is transparent, all institutions will need to begin to report more information concerning outputs rather than inputs. That means a report on how many students are actually using the university's library is more important than how many tomes have accumulated in the stacks over the years. It means that how students do when they leave the institution is as important as the grades earned while enrolled. And a report showing what students learned and whether they understand how to function in the workplace using technology, working with teams, and demonstrating critical thinking to solve problems is more beneficial than a report showing how many students graduated from the institution within a specified number of years.
 
Completion Rates
With this greater emphasis on accountability and transparency in higher education from the public sector, the government, and individual students and parents as well, a great deal of discussion surrounds institutional graduation rates. Some would like to use graduation rates as the main yardstick for determining whether a college is actually educating students, and if attending that institution is worth the time and money the students (or their parents) must spend to earn a degree.
To assist the government and the public, the Department of Education instituted the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System or IPEDS. According to the National Center for Education Statistics website, IPEDS is described as "...the primary source for data on
16
colleges, universities, and technical and vocational post-secondary institutions in the United States."
IPEDS gathers information from every institution participating in the federal student financial aid programs. However, many IPEDS definitions, particularly those that define students counted in the completion rates, are based on traditional students: those who have gone directly from high school to a four-year college; those who enroll full-time; those who have not earned credit from any other institution; and those who graduate within six years or 150 percent of the normal completion time.
"The more you learn, the more you earn and the less likely you are to be unemployed. Earnings increase and unemployment decreases with additional years of education. But completing a program is worth more than attending college without earning a degree."
Bureau of Labor Statistics
As noted earlier in this report, the number of students who qualify in that category decreases each year. There are many reasons for this decrease, not the least of which today is that many students have fallen into the status of economic drop outs those students who, due to the failing economy, cannot continue their educations uninterrupted. When these students do return to college, many will not return full-time, others will have earned transfer credits at community colleges while working full-time, and many will transfer to institutions closer to their homes or to those where tuition is lower, etc. When students do this stop out or transfer to other institutions they are lost to the IPEDS count for graduation rates for all institutions.
To put this into perspective, many of the non-traditional students who make up the Next Generation Learners are missing from the IPEDS graduation rate summaries. According to the American Federation of Teachers, "Another shortcoming of using snapshot institutional data is that it obscures two separate policy issues: extended time-to-degree and dropping out. Students still enrolled after 150 percent of expected graduation time represent a growing trend in higher education."
17
According to the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, "critics have denounced graduation rates as inadequate and misleading." Further, "disclosure of such rates and public policy based on them unfairly condemns institutions whose access missions lead them to accept at-risk students." Certainly no one is advocating that graduation rates be ignored, but the rates should be put into context to be meaningful tools for analysis. At-risk students do have a greater chance of failing to complete degree
18
 
programs, hence the term at-risk. However, many of these students can and do complete degree programs when given the appropriate support and tools to do so. They may take longer than 150 percent of the IPEDS-defined normal completion time, but many do complete degree programs and continue on to graduate level programs as well.
Return on Investment (ROI)
The Student
Besides graduation rates, determining if an institution is adding value to the student's education is an essential part of determining whether a college education is beneficial and if there is a return on the
"Education," Aristotle said, "is the best provision for old age. For individual citizens, education provides a basis for economic security that can last into retirement. For society as a whole, education builds the foundation for ensuring economic prosperity now and in the future."
The Economic Return on Investment in South Carolina's Higher Education
investments of both money and time. College attendance has been shown to have beneficial effects on students even if they do not complete their degree programs. According to the Carnegie Foundation, "college attendance has been shown to decrease prejudice, enhance knowledge of world affairs and enhance social status..." Certainly completion of a college degree should be the goal, but the value added to the student and society of the time spent in college should not be ignored.
19
To illustrate this point, the Bureau of Labor Statistics notes that "the more you learn, the more you earn." In addition, those people who have attended college are less likely to be laid off than those who have not attended college at all. People who attend some college might expect earnings of approximately $1.5 million as compared to those people who do not continue their
education beyond high school who generally earn about $1.2 million in their lifetime. Of course, completing a degree program will increase the likelihood of increased lifetime earnings with each upper level degree earned.

Society
In addition to the increased quality of life of the educated individual, it has been established that as a group, college educated citizens vote more, volunteer in the community at a higher rate, smoke less, and are less likely to be involved in crime. To illustrate these societal benefits, consider the conclusions of a study done by researchers at the University of California at Berkeley:
22
Affordability in higher education means many things. A college education is an investment in an individual as well as an investment in the community and society in general.
The information above was summarized by the Campaign for College Opportunity, a California non-profit organization cofounded in 2003 with a mission to ensure California produces one million additional college graduates by 2025 to meet the workforce demands of the future.
23
The report from which these statements were drawn was created prior to the current economic crisis gripping California and, while California's situation may be extreme, it is not the only state undergoing serious budgetary issues and facing tough decisions about the amount of taxpayer dollars that can be allocated to higher education. And yet, as the information in the UC Berkeley report emphasizes, investment in higher education pays off for both the student and the communities in which they live.
 
In 2008, the University of Phoenix published its first Academic Annual Report. That report presented a transparent look at a variety of ways in which the University measures itself in relation to its Mission and social agenda of access and inclusion. The purpose of this year's report is similar and, as such, it contains the results for many of the same measurements. While it is clear that two years cannot adequately point to significant trends, we make note of several comparative indicators.
In general, there is great similarity in results as compared to last year. For instance, it can be noted that student and faculty diversity in ethnicity and gender remain about the same as last year. In the area of student satisfaction, students reported slightly higher rates this year over last. In addition, this year's report now contains results of the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) showing University of Phoenix students' responses, as well as those of an aggregate of national institutions. This measurement was not in place last year and, as such, is a first-time baseline for future comparison.
In the area of information literacy, the results shown in Tables 6 and 7 indicate that scores for seniors continue to increase over those reported for freshmen at approximately the same rate. Academic progress and progression, always of special interest, shows a slight decrease this year; however, the overall comparison between the University of Phoenix students and their contemporaries is comparable because the variance in scores measured is far less than the margin of error as indicated by the standard deviation reported this year.
The Completion Rates for the University show a slight decline in the number of students graduating in 150 percent of the traditional time to degree completion. The University has identified several possible contributing factors that it will continue to assess going forward. This is discussed more fully below in the section titled Directions for the Future.
Last year's Academic Annual Report included the Net Cost to Taxpayers defined by institution type. This year's figure for the amount that the University of Phoenix pays back for each student educated is less than it was last year; however, the University of Phoenix continues to pay back, rather than diminish, public coffers. In addition, the University will continue to monitor this situation and will attempt to identify salient elements going forward.
DEMOGRAPHICS*
The Students
The students who attend the University of Phoenix are representative of the general population of the United States of America. They come predominantly from the 73 percent of non-traditional students who make up the majority of students enrolled in higher education today. They are the Next Generation Learners and they include:
They are people who embody the American spirit, and America needs them to succeed.
*All UOPX demographic numbers shown are compiled from those students who responded to the survey.
 
Almost half the University's enrollment consists of students from underrepresented racial or ethnic communities well beyond the institutional average nationwide as shown on the following charts.

Diversity brings vibrancy to the classroom, creating an environment where multiple perspectives are shared to the benefit of all.
Diverse Issues in Higher Education
25
Charts showing the demographic breakdown of the University of Phoenix students by degree program as compared to the demographics of the national student population are shown below.
 
As the charts show, undergraduate enrollment at the University of Phoenix is more ethnically diverse than the latest national enrollment figures provided by the National Center for Education Statistics. Female students comprise 67 percent of the undergraduate University of Phoenix enrollment, as compared to 57 percent of the national undergraduate students.
Graduate student enrollment at the University of Phoenix is ethnically diverse with more than 50 percent minority enrollment as opposed to 36 percent minority enrollment nationally.
 
The Faculty
The University of Phoenix currently has approximately 1,500 Core Faculty and more than 25,500 Associate Faculty members.
The Associate Faculty are those faculty members contracted to teach individual classes or activities. The Core Faculty is composed of two subcategories: Administrative Faculty and Lead Faculty. Administrative Faculty are faculty members whose duties include a combination of instruction, curriculum oversight and
development, and/or academic and faculty administration. Lead Faculty are those faculty members who have been contracted for at least a year to serve as Area Chairs and others whose roles serve instructional purposes.

effort to ensure that it graduates highly qualified individuals from its programs. Accordingly, all prospective faculty members are required to go through the same sophisticated screening and certification process regardless of where they wish to teach.
The following charts show the ethnicity and gender breakdown for University of Phoenix faculty, as well as national faculty demographics. Faculty ethnicity for the University is more diverse than the figures provided by NCES for American faculty in general.The University of Phoenix faculty is made up in almost equal portions of men (51 percent) and women (49 percent). Women make up a larger portion of University of Phoenix faculty in comparison to the national breakdown, comparing to the National Center for Education Statistics, which shows females made up only 42 percent of faculty nationwide in 2007.

COMPARATIVE OUTCOME RESULTS
Student Satisfaction
"It might be argued that dissatisfied students may cut back on the number of courses or drop out of college completely. Hence, the satisfaction intention retention link for students in higher education should be studied and carefully managed."
Business Student Satisfaction, Intentions and Retention in Higher Education: An Empirical Investigation
Student retention has always been a conundrum for colleges and universities. Exactly what it takes to keep students in college and to assist them in successfully completing a degree program is somewhat elusive. For many years, retention studies focused on academic ability as the predictor of retention. However, many researchers found that academic performance explained only about half of the variance. Student satisfaction plays a large part in whether students continue in their studies, whether they return or go on for a graduate degree, and whether or not the students would recommend their institution to others.
27
The University regularly conducts student
satisfaction surveys and uses these results to implement change within the organization. The following tables show student satisfaction at the University of Phoenix as compiled from internal surveys including the following:

Information Literacy
"The greatest challenge facing us today is how to organize information into structured knowledge. We must rise above the obsession with the quantity of information and the speed of transmission, and focus on the fact that the key issue for us is our ability to organize the information once it has been amassed, to assimilate it, to find meaning in it and assure its survival."
Dr. Vartan Gregorian, President, Carnegie Corporation in the keynote address presented at the White House Conference on School Libraries June 2002
The information explosion that erupted in the late 20th century is still being felt today and will continue to influence all our lives. The magnitude of exactly what happened is difficult to comprehend at times. To put it into context, the Library of Congress was established in 1800 and by the 20th century it had become the largest library in the world, with nearly 142 million items on approximately 650 miles of bookshelves. In the first 18 months of the dot-com revolution, the amount of text on the Web already exceeded that of the Library of Congress.
30
31
A challenge for higher education is to ensure that students are able to use digital technologies, communication tools, and networks to solve problems. Using these tools to solve problems involves the ability to locate information, to determine the type of data and research required, to evaluate the quality of the source and the information, and to understand and follow the ethical and legal issues surrounding use of Internet resources.
The skills required to become successful in the digital workplace are woven throughout the five Learning Goals required for all University of Phoenix courses and programs: professional
 
competence and values; critical thinking and problem solving, communication, information utilization, and collaboration.
In addition, the University has taken steps to ensure that the way students learn emulates the way professionals work today. The University Library houses more than 20 million articles, more than 65,000 publications, and 114 databases available to users seven days a week from anywhere there is an Internet connection. The University began building an eBook library that now contains approximately 1,800 books and reference sources being used in 91 percent of all courses. All students and faculty have access to the entire eBook Collection throughout their degree programs.
Another example is Virtual Organizations which are realistic web-based businesses, schools, health care and government organizations that promote authentic assessment by immersing students into problem-based learning environments. Virtual Organizations provide a solution to the difficulties students have in gaining access to proprietary information. They also provide a relevant context for students to practice solving workplace problems. Virtual Organizations are distinct from simulations and case studies because they present students with a microcosm of the real world. Students must first determine what data is needed to solve a problem, locate the appropriate information through data mining a specific Virtual Organization, and apply that information to solve the problem. Virtual Organizations provide students a full range of data that includes financial statements, personnel records, and other information essential to practice applying theoretical knowledge to solving problems. More than 50,000 unique users access Virtual Organizations each month.
Standardized Assessment of Information Literacy Skills (SAILS)
In an effort to benchmark student achievement in information literacy as compared to students from other similar institutions and to make internal University of Phoenix comparisons, the University makes use of the Standardized Assessment of Information Literacy Skills (SAILS) originally developed by Kent State University and endorsed by the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL).
32
The SAILS assessment is based on the following ACRL standards of Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education:
The information literate student determines the nature and extent of the information needed.
Standard I:
The information literate student accesses needed information effectively and efficiently.
Standard II:
The information literate student evaluates information and its sources critically and incorporates selected information into his or her knowledge base and value system.
Standard III:
The information literate student understands many of the economic, legal, and social issues surrounding the use of information and accesses and uses information ethically and legally.
Standard V:*
*ACRL Standard IV is not used in the SAILS assessment.
 
As the SAILS Freshmen table below shows, University of Phoenix freshmen score as well or better in all but two areas measured through the SAILS assessment as incoming students at other institutions offering at least baccalaureate through graduate level programs.
33

The next table, SAILS Seniors, shows that University of Phoenix seniors compare favorably or the same in benchmark comparisons to students at other similar institutions in all but two areas.
Table 7: SAILS Seniors

Further and perhaps more important is that University of Phoenix seniors score better than UOPX freshmen in each of the literacy competencies measured in this survey.
The percentage of improvement for University of Phoenix freshmen and seniors is comparable to that of the improvement for like groups in the national survey.
*Master's Freshmen and Seniors reference institutions that offer baccalaureate through graduate degrees.
 
Measure of Academic Proficiency and Progress (MAPP)
As a part of the assessment process and in particular in response to the third principle, the University of Phoenix uses the Measure of Academic Proficiency and Progress (MAPP) assessment developed by the Educational Testing Service (ETS).
The Educational Testing Service is a non-profit organization with a mission to "advance quality and equity in education for all people worldwide." ETS administers the Measure of Academic Proficiency and Progress or MAPP assessment, a test of college-level skills in critical thinking, reading, writing, mathematics, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences to undergraduate students. The assessment was developed to assist institutions in the assessment of the outcomes of general education programs to improve the quality of instruction and learning. According to their website, MAPP results allow the institution to:

Completion Rates
As noted earlier in this report, emphasis on completion rates as the main or only indicator of student success is misguided. In the report, , the authors indicate that the median time-to-degree completion for those students (both Pell recipients and non-recipients) who graduated in 1999-2000, but who had stopped out at one point during their undergraduate education, was 92 months or close to eight years. At the University of Phoenix, 53 percent of the students qualified for Pell Grants in 2008-09. In addition, those students (Pell Grant recipients and non-recipients) who had characteristics such as transferring, stopping out, having parents who did not graduate from college, and other undergraduate risk factors, were frequently associated with a longer time-to-degree.

36
To ignore these students who do persist and complete their educations is a disservice. The Institute of Higher Education Policy indicates that, in general, college graduates have higher levels of savings, increased personal and professional mobility, improved quality of life for themselves and their children, and better consumer decision-making skills. The Institute does not qualify these graduates as only those who have completed their educations within four, six, or any other set number of years.

IPEDS completion rates for the University of Phoenix showing associate, baccalaureate, and graduate students, as well as IPEDS public institution completion rates are below. Table 10 includes additional columns (>3 years for associate and graduate students, and >6 years for baccalaureate students). These columns have been added in anticipation of possible changes in the IPEDS reporting system for the coming year that may include collection and reporting of these figures for all participating institutions.

AFFORDABILITY AND RETURN ON INVESTMENT
Many University of Phoenix students are employed full-time while enrolled. Internal research has shown that University of Phoenix students' average annual salaries for the time they are enrolled in their program of study increase at higher rates than the national average salary increase for the same time period.

Other Costs Associated with Higher Education
It is also important to examine the cost of higher education to the taxpayer when a student attends a public university, a private non-profit institution, and a for-profit institution. The focus for most taxpayers is on public institutions because they are taxpayer supported and represent a hefty portion of each state's annual budget. What may not be quite as obvious, however, is that taxpayers also contribute heavily to non-profit, private institutions, even those with generous endowment programs. For-profit institutions such as the University of Phoenix, however, actually return money to the public for each student educated. The following table (and the operational definitions that follow) compares the net cost to taxpayers per student at public institutions, not-for-profit, for-profits in general, and the University of Phoenix specifically. As the table shows, the University of Phoenix actually pays back approximately $140 per student, when the calculations for the difference in factors between tax-exempt status, tuition subsidies, and various other foregone taxes are considered.

General Note: Unless otherwise noted, the data tables referred to are:
1. Number of Students  Full-Time Equivalent
The number of FTE students was drawn from:
2. Direct Government Support
Drawn from Table 21. Revenues of Title IV institutions, by level of institution, accounting standards utilized, and source of funds: United States, fiscal year 2007. Line items include:
 
3. Auxiliary Enterprises
Drawn from Table 21. Revenues of Title IV institutions, by level of institution, accounting standards utilized, and source of funds: United States, fiscal year 2007. Revenues not coming from government or tuition. Line items include:
 
4. Student Loans  Interest Rate Subsidy
Federally guaranteed student loans were available at a rate of 6.8 percent in 2007. Similarly, unsecured loans would have an interest rate in the range of 10 percent. The difference amounts to a federal subsidy for higher education that was estimated to be 3 percent. The size of the subsidy was estimated with a six-step process.
 
5. Expected Future Student Loan Losses Due to Default
6. Taxes Foregone on Endowments  Investment Income
 
Note: The Investment return for four-year not-for-profit institutions was 30.7 percent of total revenue. This was quite a bit higher than 23.4 percent in fiscal year 2006 and 23.1 percent in fiscal year 2004.
7. Taxes Foregone on Additions to Endowments
Contributions to the endowments of public and not-for-profit institutions avoid income taxes
8. Taxes Foregone on Gifts, Grants, and Contracts
Gifts, grants, and contracts received by public and not-for-profit institutions have tax consequences for the donors. The income taxes these institutions avoided was estimated using the effective income tax rate of 38 percent, which was from the Apollo Group 2007 Annual Report. Capital appropriations for public institutions was assumed to be of no cost to the taxpayers because one asset, cash, is being transferred into another asset of equal value such as a building or infrastructures.
9. Taxes Foregone on Corporate Profits
The Apollo Group had a provision for income taxes of 9.1 percent of its total revenue (or approximately 38 percent of pre-tax income). A similar percentage was applied to public and non-for profit schools to estimate the taxes these institutions avoided. Total revenue data was gathered from Table 21.
10. Sales and Other Taxes Foregone
Similarly, it was estimated that Apollo Group paid 0.5 percent of total revenue for sales and use taxes, personal property taxes, and real property taxes. This was an extremely conservative estimate because it was calculated only from supplier invoices that itemized the amount of taxes paid. This calculation was obtained from Apollo Tax Department. This percentage (0.5 percent) was applied to the total revenues of public and not-for-profit schools as an estimate of the additional taxes avoided.
11. Tax on Corporate Profits
Corporate taxes paid by for-profit institutions were estimated from total revenue (Table 21 and Apollo Group 2007 Annual Report) at a rate of 9.1 percent (or approximately 38 percent of pre-tax income).
 
12. Sales and Other Taxes
Sales and other taxes paid by for-profit institutions were estimated from total revenue (Table 21and Apollo Group 2007 Annual Report) at a rate of 0.5 percent. This calculation was obtained from the Apollo Tax Department.
13. Research Expense
The amount of money spent on research activities was drawn from Table 23. Expenses of Title IV institutions, by level of institution, accounting standards utilized, and type of expense: United States, fiscal year 2007.
 
Transparency is critical for the health of all institutions of higher education. But there is little point to collecting and reporting data for the sole purpose of reporting. If the data are not put to use for institutional improvements that lead to enhancements in the overall student experience and result in student success, the university cannot fulfill its potential. In this regard, this Academic Annual Report is used not only to provide transparency but also as a tool for self-analysis and continuous improvement.
In areas where comparisons can be made and declines were found, no matter how slight, the University has initiated thoughtful dialogue as to the possible reasons for the changes. Specifically, the University reviewed the possible reasons for the decline in completion rates (1 percentage point for associate, 2 percentage points for baccalaureate, and 5 percentage points for graduates within the traditional time to completion) shown in Table 10. The University is currently exploring possible reasons for the slight decline in completion rates. Specifically, it is examining the demographics of Next Generation Learners and how this unique student population learns. Important factors in this analysis will include age, previous academic experience, transfer credits, and preference for learning modality.
In response to data gathered to this point, the University has determined specific areas to be addressed in an effort to continue our Mission to provide access to higher education opportunities that enable students to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to be successful. These include programs for orientation, a refined approach to the introductory courses, and a just-in-time plan for remediation.
SOLUTIONS
The University of Phoenix recognizes that expanding access is only one part of the equation in meeting the goal of increasing academic attainment successfully. To meet the needs of the Next Generation Learners, many of whom enroll at the University of Phoenix, and in an effort to respond to the call to arms by the Obama administration to meet the needs of the American public, the University has redefined and realigned several foundational elements of the student experience.
The Role of Technology
Next Generation Learners experience life, and thus education, differently from previous generations. They live in a world enhanced by technology and this fact affects their expectations for accessibility and service within the higher education environment. The University of Phoenix has developed cutting edge systems for delivering curriculum and providing academic support to students throughout their programs of study. The availability of all University systems on a 24/7 basis redefines for students the notion of "going to school" in terms that make sense for students who cannot be limited by space or time restrictions. With this in mind, the University has set as its goal the building of a twenty-first century learning platform that will take us to the next level of higher education service and delivery.
Rethinking Strategies for Student Success
Scheduled for implementation within the next year are two programs: the University Orientation and the First-Year Sequence. It is anticipated that these programs will be required for all students entering with fewer than 24 credits. These programs are designed to meet
 
both types of student knowledge that have been identified as requirements for success: heuristic knowledge and theoretical knowledge. The programs cover more than basic academic skills; they include everything from finances to fitness, taking a holistic approach by educating the whole person as opposed to focusing solely on classroom skills. Attention is given to ensure that all students entering the University of Phoenix are familiar with and understand how and when to use the academic assets and learning tools provided to them and how to establish strong relationships with faculty and advisors.
University Orientation
at this time. In this way, students are encouraged to take personal responsibility for their learning. Faculty teaching in the orientation program will be experienced full-time faculty who understand the complexities of orienting a new student specifically to the University of Phoenix.
The stated purposes and goals reflect a program that will meet the students' needs as well as one that is in concert with three of the four national goals as stated by the Obama administration. (The fourth goal, "having stronger links between education and jobs," is addressed in the First-Year Sequence.)
 
The Orientation program affords prospective students the opportunity to experience the rigors of the college classroom without financial burden. In this way, the University is allowing those students who are not ready, the opportunity to realize this without incurring unnecessary debt and going through the arduous process of applying for private or federal financial aid. It is anticipated that many of the students who do not successfully complete orientation are the same students who very likely would not complete their first enrolled course.
The First-Year Sequence (FYS)
The second prong of the planned approach to increasing student retention and success for at-risk students is the implementation of a customized sequence of courses. The First-Year Sequence will be the entry path for all students entering University of Phoenix to pursue an associate or bachelor's degree who have fewer than 24 college units. The course content of the First-Year Sequence is based in liberal arts, interdisciplinary studies, and academic skills and strategies. The First-Year Sequence meets the fourth plank of the Obama education platform, "creating a skilled workforce by having stronger links between education and jobs."
The First-Year Sequence has been designed in four blocks with the student at the center. The curriculum begins by addressing things that matter to students as individuals such as health and finances. From there, the subject matter progresses to thinking outward to issues affecting community, national trends, and global concerns. To progress to that point and keep the students engaged, however, it must start first with the individual student. Each block builds upon, reinforces, and recycles the academic skills introduced in the previous blocks. The course content is interrelated to reinforce content and skill building mastered in each course.
To accomplish this, the First-Year Sequence has been designed with the concept of laddering material taught over multiple courses. In this way, it is expected that students will learn and retain more information than they would if they were learning everything in one course. To integrate the holistic approach to learning that will encourage development of the heuristic skills required for persistence, the First-Year Sequence will also establish a sense of community among the entry-level students. This will be bolstered primarily by an increase in participation. An increased focus on interaction within discussion groups online and in the classroom will lead to more group spirit and a sense of the individual as part of a larger, successful group.
A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON REMEDIATION: JUST-IN-TIME SKILLS
The traditional method of remediation is to test incoming students and, based on these results, require students to successfully complete an entire remedial course or courses prior to
 
being admitted into a regular course of study. However, studies done by the National Center for Postsecondary Research indicate that the current methods of remediation "allow early persistence, but not necessarily degree completion." From this, it could be inferred that students who successfully complete the remedial courses are able to regurgitate information immediately, but cannot retain or perhaps apply their learning when the time comes for them to take the advanced courses in which the skills are required.
39
The University of Phoenix made the decision to change its approach to remediation and institute a program of integrative learning on a gradual plane to provide just-in-time skills. Through these programs, the University makes learning opportunities available to students throughout their academic career, not just at the beginning and not all in one sink-or-swim course. In a recent commentary article in , the author, Mike Rose, a professor of social research methodology at UCLA, suggests that we rethink, "core assumptions about cognition and language: Writing filled with grammatical errors does not preclude engagement with sophisticated intellectual materials, and errors can be dealt with effectively as one works with such material." Understanding this is key to changing remedial education to work for all students when they need it and without sacrificing appropriate academic progression.
The Chronicle of Higher Education
40
The University of Phoenix provides remediation for students needing assistance through online tools that are available to students at every level and throughout their entire academic program. Students requiring assistance with language and writing skills can avail themselves of many services offered through the Center for Writing Excellence and mathematics assistance is available through the Center for Mathematics Excellence. The Centers can be accessed by any student or faculty member twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, wherever Internet access is available. In addition, tutors and faculty are available at Resource Centers and campuses located around the country. The Alumni Association has recently implemented an Alumni Mentor program to assist students.
Center for Writing Excellence
The Center for Writing Excellence (CWE) provides resources to help enhance and strengthen written communication skills. The resources are divided into six main sections that include the WritePoint system, Tutor Review, the Spanish Writing Lab, Dissertation Services, Tutorials and Guides, and the Turnitin Plagiarism Checker.
sm
WritePoint is an online automated system that provides students with immediate feedback on grammar, punctuation, word usage, and some style points. In seconds, the system flags grammatical issues and inserts instructional feedback into the text of the paper. Students are directed to resources to assist them in understanding errors and how to correct them, making this a learning experience on all levels.
sm
In an average month, more than 600,000 papers are submitted to WritePoint for review. In most cases, WritePoint is able to return the paper to the student within one minute.
sm
sm
In addition to WritePoint, the University of Phoenix offers an online Tutor Review service, which gives students the opportunity to have their papers reviewed by faculty. Students receive detailed feedback on format, grammar, organization, punctuation, and usage but not on the academic content. Content feedback is the responsibility of course instructors. Tutors provide feedback within 48 hours and typically review approximately 6,000 or more
sm
 
papers per month. The Tutor Review by faculty also provides a Spanish Writing Lab for the campuses in which Spanish is the native language.
For those students who need assistance understanding what plagiarism is, the University offers a tutorial and access to a plagiarism checker, powered by Turnitin.com. Plagiarism Checker promotes originality in student work and improves student writing and research skills. Plagiarism Checker reviews almost 400,000 papers for both students and faculty each month with an average turnaround time of less than 15 minutes.
Center for Mathematics Excellence
Another manifestation of the just-in-time skills philosophy is the Center for Mathematics Excellence (CME). The CME was instituted to address the needs of all students, especially those who may not have the requisite math skills, those who have not practiced math for some time, and those who suffer from math anxiety. The CME specifically addresses these issues, dispels math anxiety myths, and suggests study and coping skills for students who dread the thought of math classes and numbers-related courses.
The CME includes Running Start, a program that is especially helpful for students in entry-level math courses. Running Start allows students to take self-assessments that result in personalized lists of topics to study. In addition, students using Running Start find that mathematic concepts are presented in multiple representations for easier comprehension. The enhanced content also includes math refresher content that many students, including those about to enter statistics courses, find extremely helpful.
Online tutoring services are also available whenever a student is enrolled in a math course. Upon entry to the tutoring site, students may either choose to work with a tutor individually or they can watch tutors work with other students in real time. Students submit questions which go into a queue and are then answered online by the tutor in the order received.
In an average month, the CME conducts almost 4,000 live tutoring sessions and approximately 10,000 students access the site for assistance.
By making remediation available online, students are able to access the services when they need them and how they need them. In addition, the stigma that sometimes accompanies remedial work is removed as the work is done in private, rather than in a formal classroom environment. Both Centers of Excellence were designed to provide as much individual assistance as possible. In both cases, the goal is to give students the tools and resources to be successful rather than simply pointing out errors.
Students use the tools appropriate for them at the time they need them. In this manner, all knowledge does not have to be gained at one time; students can progress with their educations and put the skills they learn into practice sooner rather than later when another refresher might be required. Remedial skill building is exactly that: a building process that works over a length of time.

The following exhibits are provided herewith:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
PHOENIX, December 14, 2009  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:APOL) (the "Company") today announced that it has entered into an agreement with the United States of America, acting through the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of California and the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of the U.S. Department of Education, and with two private plaintiffs to resolve the False Claims Act lawsuit filed in 2003 against subsidiary University of Phoenix, . Although a party to the agreement, the U.S. Department of Justice at no time intervened in the lawsuit, which was pursued by the two private plaintiffs as a qui tam action on behalf of the government. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will pay $67.5 million to the United States. A separate agreement provides for the payment by the Company of $11 million in attorneys fees to the plaintiffs, as required by the False Claims Act.
United States of America ex rel. Mary Hendow and Julie Albertson v. University of Phoenix
"This agreement not only brings closure to a long-running dispute and enables the Company to avoid the uncertainty and further expense associated with protracted litigation, it opens the door for a more constructive partnership with our lead regulator, the U.S. Department of Education," said Charles B. Edelstein, co-chief executive officer of Apollo Group. "Apollo Group is committed to rigorous regulatory and compliance systems to serve and protect the academic innovations for which we are known," added Gregory Cappelli, co-chief executive officer of Apollo Group and chairman of Apollo Global, Inc. "Resolution enables us to focus on our core mission of providing access to quality higher education opportunities for students who have been historically underserved by the conventional system of higher education  and at a time when such access is more critical than ever."
The agreement makes clear that the Company does not acknowledge, admit or concede any liability, wrongdoing, noncompliance or violation as a result of the settlement. Moreover, the Company is confident it will not face any further civil or administrative exposure relating to its compliance with the Higher Education Act provision relating to incentive compensation for the
 
period of March 1997 through the present as a result of the various releases and related agreements it has obtained from the U.S. Department of Education, U.S. Department of Justice and the plaintiffs.
"While we believe that the compensation practices and programs of University of Phoenix have always complied fully with applicable federal laws and regulations, the regulations at issue in this case were unclear and inconsistent and, even after they were clarified by Safe Harbor provisions, involved complex judgments and interpretations," said P. Robert Moya, executive vice president, general counsel and secretary of Apollo Group. "Settlement on these terms eliminates the risks inherent in taking any case to trial and, ultimately, is in the best interests of our students, employees and shareholders."
"On behalf of the plaintiffs, we are pleased that the parties have been able to reach an agreement on terms that protect the interests of the government and the taxpayers," said Robert J. Nelson, Lieff, Cabraser, Heimann & Bernstein, LLP, lead counsel for the plaintiffs. "The case raised several challenging issues, many of them novel, which made settlement of the case appropriate."
About the Litigation
Under the False Claims Act, plaintiffs  or relators  sue as "partial assignees" of the government's claims for alleged injuries to the government. The False Claims Act lawsuit against University of Phoenix was filed by two private plaintiffs in March 2003 in United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, Sacramento Division. The suit alleged University of Phoenix violated a federal statute and regulation stating that while recruiters may be compensated based in part on the number of students they enroll, it cannot be the sole factor for determining their compensation. After review of the lawsuit's allegations and consultation with the U.S. Department of Education, the U.S. Department of Justice declined to join in the litigation. In fact, in a brief submitted to the Ninth Circuit in connection with the case, the Justice Department expressed "the government's strong support for the important work of proprietary institutions of higher education, like University of Phoenix, that are providing much-needed educational opportunities to people looking to advance their careers and to earn a better living for themselves and their families." In September 2003, the plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint, followed by a Second Amended Complaint in March 2004. The Court twice dismissed this case, ultimately with prejudice, before it was reinstated by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in September 2006.

Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(d) Exhibits.
The following exhibit is furnished herewith:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
Phoenix, Arizona, January 7, 2010  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or the "Company") today reported financial results for the three months ended November 30, 2009.
"We are pleased with our first quarter results and continued enrollment growth, particularly among our core bachelor's programs," said Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer and Apollo Global Chairman Greg Cappelli. "We remain committed to providing access to high-quality education, while ensuring that only students who have a reasonable chance to succeed enroll in our institutions."
Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer Chas Edelstein, added, "We have recently received an important recertification of University of Phoenix's Program Participation Agreement and have successfully resolved some significant uncertainties. In addition, University of Phoenix published its second Academic Annual Report, demonstrating our commitment to championing accountability and transparency in academics."
Unaudited First Quarter of Fiscal 2010 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the three months ended November 30, 2009, totaled $1,270.3 million, which represents a 30.8% increase over the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Contributing to the growth in the first quarter was an 18.4% year-over-year increase in University of Phoenix total Degreed Enrollment to 455,600 as well as $88.7 million in revenue from recently acquired BPP Holdings. The Company reported net income attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended November 30, 2009, of $240.1 million, or $1.54 per share (156.0 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to net income attributable to Apollo Group of $180.4 million, or $1.12 per share (160.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended November 30, 2008.
The first quarter of fiscal 2010 results contain a tax benefit of $11.4 million resulting from the settlement of disputed tax issues with the Internal Revenue Service. Excluding this special item, net income attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended November 30, 2009, was $228.7 million, or $1.47 per share, compared to net income attributable to Apollo Group of $180.4 million, or $1.12 per share for the three months ended November 30, 2008. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, BPP's operations contributed $88.7 million to revenue and increased earnings per share by approximately $0.04. (See the supplemental schedule detailing
1
 
BPP's financial results and those of Apollo Group excluding BPP for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 in the tables section of this press release.)
Instructional costs and services increased by $152.2 million, or 40.3% to $529.5 million for the three months ended November 30, 2009, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2008. As a percentage of net revenue, instructional costs and services increased 280 basis points to 41.7% versus 38.9% in the prior year's first quarter. The increase, as a percentage of revenue, was predominantly due to the addition of BPP, as its cost structure is more heavily weighted towards instructional costs and services. The increase was also due to higher bad debt expense which, as a percentage of revenue, grew 130 basis points to 4.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 versus 3.6% in the first quarter a year ago. BPP's operations favorably impacted overall bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue by 40 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The higher bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenue, is primarily a result of lower collection rates on aged receivables, due in part, to the economic downturn, as well as a continued shift in University of Phoenix's student mix to a higher percentage of students in associate degree programs. Partially offsetting the increase in instructional costs and services was continued leverage of the Company's fixed costs including classroom space.
Selling and promotional expenses increased by $46.9 million, or 20.5%, to $275.5 million for the three months ended November 30, 2009, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2008. A substantial portion of the increase resulted from investments in the Company's non-internet long-term branding initiatives. As a percentage of net revenue, selling and promotional expenses declined 180 basis points to 21.7% versus 23.5% in the prior year's first quarter. The reduction, as a percentage of revenue, was less when excluding the impact of BPP's operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The remaining decrease as a percentage of revenue was mainly a result of continued improvement in enrollment counselor effectiveness at University of Phoenix.
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses increased by $14.2 million, or 24.4%, to $72.4 million, for the three months ended November 30, 2009, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2008. As a percentage of net revenue, G&A expenses declined 30 basis points to 5.7% versus 6.0% in the prior year's first quarter. The decrease is mainly attributable to a reduction of share-based compensation expense, as a percentage of revenue. BPP's operations had little impact on G&A expenses as a percentage of net revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
The Company's effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 was 38.4%. The decrease versus a year ago is principally attributable to the tax benefit of $11.4 million resulting from the settlement of disputed tax issues with the Internal Revenue Service.
Financial and Operating Metrics
Below are Apollo Group's unaudited financial data and operating metrics for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 versus the prior year period.

Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of November 30, 2009, the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash, totaled $924.8 million as compared to $987.8 million as of August 31, 2009. The decrease is primarily attributable to repayments on the Company's outstanding debt, largely offset by cash generated from operations. Restricted cash increased by $37.8 million compared to August 31, 2009, primarily due to increased student enrollment. Student deposits decreased by $11.5 million compared to August 31, 2009, due to increased student enrollment at the University of Phoenix which was more than offset by a reduction in student deposits at BPP due to the timing of course starts.
At November 30, 2009, accounts receivable increased to $341.0 million from $298.3 million at August 31, 2009. Excluding accounts receivable and the associated revenue for Apollo Global, the Company's days sales outstanding ("DSO") increased to 32 days at November 30, 2009, consistent with August 31, 2009, and compared to 26 days at November 30, 2008. The increase in DSO versus a year ago is due to certain operational changes that cause an increase in the Company's accounts receivable balance, as well as increases in gross accounts receivable due to lower collection rates on aged receivables.
Total deferred revenue at November 30, 2009, increased to $377.1 million from $333.0 million at August 31, 2009. The increase is principally due to increased student enrollment at University of Phoenix and the timing of course starts at BPP.
Total debt outstanding (including short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt) decreased by $396.3 million to $192.8 million at November 30, 2009, from $589.1 million at August 31, 2009. The decrease is due to the repayment of US denominated borrowings on the Company's $500 million credit facility.
U.S. Department of Education Program Review
On December 31, 2009, University of Phoenix received the Department of Education's Program Review Report, which is a preliminary report of the Department's findings from its February 2009 program review of University of Phoenix's policies and procedures involving Title IV programs. The report contains six findings and one concern. The Company believes its liability resulting from the findings will be approximately $1.5 million. In addition, the Department's regulations require certain institutions to post a letter of credit where a preliminary program review report cites untimely return of unearned Title IV funds for more than 10% of the sampled students. Absent relief from this requirement, the University of Phoenix will be required to post by January 30, 2010, a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $125 million.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
This press release and the related conference call contain non-GAAP financial measures, which are intended to supplement, but not substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Management uses, and chooses to disclose to investors, these non-GAAP financial measures because (i) such measures provide an additional analytical tool to clarify the Company's results from operations and help to identify underlying trends in its results of operations; (ii) as to the non-GAAP earnings measures, such measures help compare the Company's performance on a consistent basis across time periods; and (iii) these non-GAAP measures are employed by the Company's management in its own evaluation of performance and are utilized in financial and operational decision-making processes, such as budgeting and forecasting. Exclusion of items in our non-GAAP presentation should not be construed as an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Other companies, including other companies in the education industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure across companies.

Exhibit 99.1
Phoenix, Arizona, February 19, 2010  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or the "Company") today announced details for its fiscal 2010 second quarter earnings conference call. In addition, in anticipation of its participation at investor conferences on February 22 and 24, 2010, the Company provided preliminary comments on its second quarter of fiscal 2010 financial results.
Preliminary Fiscal 2010 Second Quarter Results
The Company currently expects consolidated net revenue from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 of approximately $1.07 billion and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of between $0.77-$0.82. Excluded from these amounts are results from Insight Schools, which the Company expects will be reported as a discontinued operation beginning with the fiscal second quarter.
Included in the results is an approximate $2.7 million after-tax charge, or $0.02 per share, for a reserve relating to a litigation matter. The stated earnings per share range also assumes that BPP's operations will adversely impact diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by $0.07-$0.09 due to its seasonally weaker revenue as well as the meaningful investments the Company is making into the BPP business. The range also assumes bad debt expense of $73-$76 million or 6.8%-7.1% as a percentage of revenue. As expected, the bad debt expense is higher than in recent quarters due to the economic downturn and the effects of the mix shift to associate students in recent years, as well as the previously disclosed operational changes the Company implemented beginning in late fiscal 2009. For the third and fourth quarters, the Company expects bad debt expense on an absolute dollar basis to be relatively consistent with the second quarter level, which would result in lower bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue from continuing operations due to seasonally higher revenue in the second half of the year.
"Current bad debt levels are higher than we would like; however, we are taking the necessary steps to reverse current trends," said Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer and Apollo Global Chairman Greg Cappelli. "Importantly, as we outlined on our last earnings call, we continue to transition the business in an effort to shift our student mix towards bachelors and graduate programs, and believe over time this will have many positive effects on the business, including reducing bad debt expense. While we are still in the early phases of these efforts, we are pleased with the initial results, particularly the continued strong enrollment in our bachelor programs."

Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer Chas Edelstein added, "Apollo Group remains dedicated to providing access to high-quality education and has recently taken additional steps to ensure that only students who are committed to the program and have a reasonable chance to succeed enroll in our institutions. Importantly, we want to help students make this determination prior to burdening themselves with debt. We believe we can accomplish these goals while achieving our long-term internal growth targets."
Share Repurchase Authorization Update
During the Company's fiscal second quarter through February 18, 2010, the Company repurchased approximately 3.4 million shares of its Class A common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $59.61 per share for a total expenditure of approximately $200 million. On February 18, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized a $500 million increase to the discretionary share repurchase program, bringing the current aggregate availability under the program to $800 million. Repurchases may be made on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules, and may include repurchases pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b5-1 nondiscretionary trading programs.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
Phoenix, Arizona, March 29, 2010  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or the "Company") today reported financial results for the three and six months ended February 28, 2010.
"We are pleased with our second quarter results, particularly with respect to the continued mix shift in student enrollments towards bachelor degree level students," said Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer Chas Edelstein. "We have set forth a strategy to transition the University of Phoenix to focus on better identifying and enrolling students who have a reasonable chance to succeed in our rigorous programs, and we are delivering on that plan."
Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer and Apollo Global Chairman Greg Cappelli added, "Through our refined marketing efforts focused on identifying students who are better prepared for our programs, as well as the positive early results we are seeing from our University Orientation pilot, we are beginning to see the shift in student mix that we have been targeting, which we believe over time will result in more consistent, higher quality growth and profitability and will positively impact a number of our key metrics."
Unaudited Second Quarter of Fiscal 2010 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the three months ended February 28, 2010, totaled $1,070.3 million, which represents a 23.1% increase over the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Contributing to the growth in the second quarter was a 15.3% year-over-year increase in University of Phoenix total Degreed Enrollment to 458,600 as well as $53.6 million in revenue from recently acquired BPP Holdings. The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended February 28, 2010, of $103.2 million, or $0.67 per share (155.2 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $128.8 million, or $0.79 per share (162.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended February 28, 2009.
The second quarter of fiscal 2010 results contain a pre-tax charge of $44.5 million ($26.9 million net of tax), which represents an accrual related to a securities class action lawsuit. Excluding this special item, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended February 28, 2010, was $130.1 million, or $0.84 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $128.8 million, or $0.79 per share for the three months ended February 28, 2009. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.) In the second quarter of fiscal 2010, BPP's operations contributed $53.6 million to revenue and due to the seasonality of its business, decreased Apollo Group's diluted earnings per share from
1
 
continuing operations by approximately $0.06. (See the supplemental schedule detailing BPP's financial results in the tables section of this press release.)
Excluded from continuing operations are the operating results for Insight Schools, which is now presented as discontinued operations, for all periods presented because the business is not longer consistent with the Company's long-term strategic objectives. The loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, associated with Insight Schools was $10.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to a loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $3.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Included in the $10.6 million loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 is a goodwill impairment charge of $9.4 million. The Company recorded this charge to reduce the carrying value of Insight Schools based on inputs from advisors which includes consideration of non-binding offers the Company recently received from third parties to purchase Insight Schools.
Instructional costs and services increased by $152.9 million, or 42.0% to $517.3 million for the three months ended February 28, 2010, compared to the three months ended February 28, 2009. As a percentage of net revenue, instructional costs and services increased 640 basis points to 48.3% versus 41.9% in the prior year's second quarter. The increase, as a percentage of revenue, was primarily due to the addition of BPP, as its cost structure is more heavily weighted towards instructional costs and services, as well as higher bad debt expense for University of Phoenix. Bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenue, increased 280 basis points to 6.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 versus 4.1% in the prior year's second quarter. BPP's operations favorably impacted overall bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue by 40 basis points in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. The higher bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenue, is due to lower collection rates. Collection rates have declined as a result of the economic downturn, the effects of certain operational changes and increases in receivables from students enrolled in associate's degree programs. Students enrolled in associate's degree programs generally persist at lower rates than those in bachelor's and graduate level programs, resulting in higher bad debts when these students withdraw.
Selling and promotional expenses increased by $38.9 million, or 17.3%, to $263.5 million for the three months ended February 28, 2010, compared to the three months ended February 28, 2009. The increase was due in part to greater investments in the University of Phoenix's non-internet long-term branding initiatives. As a percentage of net revenue, selling and promotional expenses declined 120 basis points to 24.6% versus 25.8% in the prior year's second quarter. The decrease, as a percentage of revenue, was driven by the impact of BPP's operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 as BPP incurs lower selling and promotional costs as a percentage of revenue compared to the Company's other businesses. The remaining decrease as a percentage of revenue was a result of continued improvement in enrollment counselor effectiveness at University of Phoenix.
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses increased by $2.6 million, or 3.7%, to $72.0 million, for the three months ended February 28, 2010, compared to the three months ended February 28, 2009. As a percentage of net revenue, G&A expenses declined 130 basis points to 6.7% versus 8.0% in the prior year's second quarter. The decrease, as a percentage of revenue, is primarily attributable to expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 resulting from an internal
2
 
review of certain Satisfactory Academic Progress calculations, as well as lower share-based compensation expense, as a percentage of revenue, in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 as compared with the prior year period. BPP's operations had little impact on G&A expenses as a percentage of net revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2010.
Financial and Operating Metrics
Below are Apollo Group's unaudited financial data and operating metrics for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 versus the prior year period.

Unaudited Six Months of Fiscal 2010 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the six months ended February 28, 2010, was $2.3 billion, a 27.1% increase over the comparable period of fiscal 2009. Contributing to this increase was a 16.8% increase in University of Phoenix's average Degreed Enrollment during the six months ended February 28, 2010, as compared to the six months ended February 28, 2009. The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $343.7 million, or $2.21 per share, (155.6 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), and $311.1 million, or $1.92 per share, (161.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the six months ended February 28, 2010, and February 28, 2009, respectively.
Results for the six months ended February 28, 2010, contain a pre-tax charge of $44.5 million ($26.9 million net of tax), which represents an accrual for a potential settlement of a securities class action lawsuit and a previously announced tax benefit of $11.4 million resulting from the settlement of disputed tax issues with the Internal Revenue Service. Excluding these special items, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the six months ended February 28, 2010, was $359.2 million, or $2.31 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $311.1 million, or $1.92 per share for the six months ended February 28, 2009. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
BPP's operations contributed $142.3 million to revenue and decreased earnings per share by approximately $0.02 for the six months ended February 28, 2010. (See the supplemental schedule detailing BPP's financial results in the tables section of this press release.)
Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of February 28, 2010, the Company's cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $660.8 million as compared to $968.2 million as of August 31, 2009. The decrease is primarily attributable to repayments on the Company's outstanding debt and share repurchases, as well as settlement payments of the Company's False Claims Act case and an IRS tax dispute. Restricted cash increased by $74.8 million compared to August 31, 2009, primarily due to increased student deposits at University of Phoenix.
At February 28, 2010, accounts receivable decreased to $261.2 million from $298.3 million at August 31, 2009. Excluding accounts receivable and the associated revenue for Apollo Global, the Company's days sales outstanding ("DSO") was 30 days at February 28, 2010, compared to 32 days at August 31, 2009, and to 25 days at February 28, 2009. The increase in DSO versus a year ago is due to increases in gross accounts receivable due to lower collection rates at University of Phoenix. Collection rates have declined as a result of the economic downturn, the effects of certain operational changes and increases in receivables from students enrolled in associate degree programs.
Total debt outstanding (including short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt) decreased by $413.0 million to $176.1 million at February 28, 2010, from $589.1 million at August 31, 2009. The decrease is primarily due to the repayment of US denominated borrowings on the Company's $500 million credit facility.

Share Repurchase Authorization
On February 18, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized a $500.0 million increase of the share repurchase program to an aggregate of $1.0 billion. During the second quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company repurchased approximately 3.4 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $59.61 per share for a total expenditure of $200.0 million. As of February 28, 2010, approximately $800.0 million remained available under the share repurchase authorization.
Business Outlook
Given the transition it is undertaking in its business, the Company offers the following commentary regarding the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 based on current business trends, which could change:
Based on current business trends, for the fiscal year 2010, the Company should achieve its long-term target of mid-teens operating income growth, excluding the impact of special items and discontinued operations.

Statements in this press release which are not statements of historical fact, including statements regarding Apollo Group's business outlook, future financial and operating results, future enrollment, and overall future strategy and plans, are forward-looking statements, and are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current information and expectations and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to various factors, including changes in the overall global economy, changes in enrollment or student mix, changes in the collectability of receivables, regulatory and litigation developments and the effectiveness of the Company's integration of its acquired businesses. For a discussion of the various factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, please refer to the risk factors and other disclosures contained in Apollo Group's Form 10-K for fiscal year 2009 and subsequent Forms 10-Q, and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, all of which are available on the Company's website at apollogrp.edu.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
This press release and the related conference call contain non-GAAP financial measures, which are intended to supplement, but not substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Management uses, and chooses to disclose to investors, these non-GAAP financial measures because (i) such measures provide an additional analytical tool to clarify the Company's results from operations and help to identify underlying trends in its results of operations; (ii) as to the non-GAAP earnings measures, such measures help compare the Company's performance on a consistent basis across time periods; and (iii) these non-GAAP measures are employed by the Company's management in its own evaluation of performance and are utilized in financial and operational decision-making processes, such as budgeting and forecasting. Exclusion of items in our non-GAAP presentation should not be construed as an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Other companies, including other companies in the education industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure across companies.

(b) Retirement of P. Robert Moya
     P. Robert Moya, Apollo Group, Inc's Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary will be retiring from Apollo Group, Inc. (the "Company"). In furtherance of his retirement, the Company entered into a special transition agreement (the "Transition Agreement") with Mr. Moya on May 17, 2010. Pursuant to the Transition Agreement, Mr. Moya will resign from his current positions as of August 31, 2010 but has agreed to continue in the Company's full time employ as Executive Vice President, Special Projects, through October 31, 2010. Mr. Moya will continue to be paid base salary at his current annual rate of $400,000 during such period of full-time employment.
     Following his period of full-time employment, Mr. Moya will convert to part-time employee status in the role of Senior Advisor for which he will be paid a monthly salary of $10,000. Unless earlier terminated by either party, that arrangement will continue through August 31, 2011, with a potential extension upon mutual agreement of the parties. Mr. Moya's outstanding stock options and restricted stock unit awards will continue to vest while he remains in the Company's employ, whether as a full-time or part-time employee.
     Mr. Moya will, upon the termination of his full-time employment on October 31, 2010, become entitled to receive the severance benefits that are provided under Section 8(b) of his existing employment agreement with the Company dated August 31, 2007 (and subsequently amended as of January 1, 2009) upon certain terminations of employment during the term of that agreement. The payment of those severance benefits will commence on May 2, 2011 upon the expiration of the required six (6)-month delay period under applicable federal tax law, with the final payment being made on October 31, 2011. As set forth in his current employment agreement with the Company, the payment of those severance benefits will be subject to Mr. Moya's delivery of a general release of all claims against the Company and its affiliates and his compliance with the non-competition and non-solicitation covenants.
     Mr. Moya's vested outstanding options will in general remain exercisable until the later of (i) August 31, 2011 or (ii) the expiration of the three (3)-month period following the date his employment terminates.
     A copy of Mr. Moya's current employment agreement has been filed as Exhibit 10.26 to the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2007, and the amendment to that agreement has been filed as Exhibit 10.9 to the Company's Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2008. Except as modified by the Transition Agreement, Mr. Moya's current employment agreement as so amended will continue in effect in accordance with its existing terms.

(e) Execution of Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with Joseph L. D'Amico
     In addition, on May 18, 2010, the Company and Joseph L. D'Amico, the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer, entered into an amended and restated employment agreement (the "Restated Agreement") that replaces the existing employment agreement between the Company and Mr. D'Amico dated June 5, 2007 and subsequently amended on three separate occasions.
     Under the Restated Agreement, the term of Mr. D'Amico's employment agreement has been extended from June 15, 2010 to August 31, 2012. During the extended term, Mr. D'Amico will continue to serve as President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company at not less than his current $525,000 annual rate of base salary. He will also continue to participate in the Company's Executive Officer Incentive Bonus Plan for each of the Company's 2011 and 2012 fiscal years at a target bonus level equal to 100% of his annual base salary.

     In addition to such cash compensation, Mr. D'Amico will receive equity grants for each of the Company's 2011 and 2012 fiscal years, made at the same time as the other regular annual grants for that fiscal year, with a grant-date fair value of at least $4 million per annual award. The awards may be made in form of stock options, restricted stock units and/or other equity-based awards covering shares of the Company's Class A common stock, as determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion. The award agreements will include special vesting acceleration and continuation provisions that would allow the unvested portion of those awards, to the extent outstanding at the time, to vest in part immediately upon his death or disability while in the Company's employ or to vest in whole over the remainder of the vesting schedule should his employment terminate under certain specified circumstances. Such continued vesting would be subject to Mr. D'Amico's compliance with certain non-competition and non-solicitation covenants.
     All of the other terms and provisions that were in effect under Mr. D'Amico's employment agreement immediately prior to the execution of the Restated Agreement, including his entitlement to cash severance payments in the event his employment terminates under certain specified circumstances, will continue in effect under the Restated Agreement.
     A copy of Mr. D'Amico's employment agreement with the Company dated June 5, 2007 has been filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2007 and copies of the three separate amendments to that agreement have been filed as attachments to the following Form 10-Q Reports of the Company: Amendment No. 1 filed as Exhibit 10.2 to the Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2007; Amendment No. 2 filed as Exhibit 10.7 to the Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2008; and Amendment No. 3 filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended February 28, 2009.

Company
Transition Agreement
Employment Agreement
     1. . Subject to the terms and conditions of this Transition Agreement, you will remain in full-time employment with the Company until the earlier of (a) October 31, 2010, or (b) the date on which your employment is sooner terminated under Section 2 below. Unless your full-time employment with the Company is terminated under Section 2 below prior to August 31, 2010, you shall resign as General Counsel and Corporate Secretary effective as of the close of business on August 31, 2010. Thereafter, you will remain employed as the Company's Executive Vice President, Special Projects until your period of part-time employment commences under Section 3 below. There will be no change in your annual rate of base salary or your eligibility for participation in the Company's employee benefit plans while you remain in full-time employment with the Company, but you will not (x) be eligible to receive any new equity awards, including any awards for the 2011 fiscal year that are expected to be made in July 2010, (y) participate in any bonus plans of the Company after August 31, 2010, or (z) otherwise be entitled to any actual or target bonus compensation for your period of service after August 31, 2010.
Continued Full-Time Employment
     Provided you continue in employment with the Company through July 2, 2010, you will vest on that date in 25% of the stock option grant made to you in July 2009 for 26,876 shares of the Company's Class A common stock. In addition, should you continue in employment through August 31, 2010, you will vest in the following installments of your other outstanding equity awards in accordance with the applicable award agreements:
 
     (i) 25% of your July 2009 restricted stock unit award for 11,058 shares of the Company's Class A common stock, provided the $350 million net book income performance goal for the 2010 fiscal year is attained, and
     (ii) the third annual installment of each of the new hire equity awards made to you on September 1, 2007, namely, the third annual installment of your stock option grant for 110,000 shares of the Company's Class A common stock and the third annual installment of your restricted stock unit award for 17,000 shares of the Company's Class A common stock.
     In addition, provided your employment with the Company continues through August 31, 2010, you will be entitled to any bonus you earn under the Executive Officer Bonus Plan for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2010 based on (i) the Company's performance for such year, as measured in terms of the revenue and operating income targets established for such year, (ii) the Compensation Committee's assessment of the Company's performance in relation to certain qualitative education initiatives and (iii) your individual performance for the year. Assessment of your achievement of performance objectives shall be in the same manner as for other executives of the Company.

Your full-time employment with the Company will continue through October 31, 2010 unless (a) the Company terminates your employment for Cause, (b) your employment terminates by reason of your death or Disability, (c) the Company terminates your employment for any reason other than for Cause or (d) you terminate your employment with or without Good Reason.

Termination of Full-Time Employment
     Effective as of October 31, 2010, you will resign as an executive officer of the Company and will not hold any further officer positions with the Company. Following the date of such resignation, you will cease to be subject to the insider reporting and trading restrictions under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; however, you will, during your period of continued employment with the Company, continue to be a restricted person subject to the addendum to the Company's insider trader policy through February 1, 2011, at which time the Company will determine whether you should continue to be such a restricted person or whether you should instead become subject to the Company's general insider trading policy in the same manner as any other Company employee. Any determination that you should continue to remain in restricted person status will be subject to periodic re-assessment from time to time after February 1, 2011 upon your request.
     3. . Unless your employment with the Company terminates earlier pursuant to Section 2 above, effective November 1, 2010 you will become a part-time employee of the Company and your commitment will be permanently reduced to a level not more than 20% of the average level of services provided by you during the three-year period preceding your conversion to such part-time status. During your period of
Conversion to Part-Time Employment
 
part-time employment, you will not be required to work, nor will you work, an average of more than one full day per week. Your part-time employment with the Company as described below will continue through September 1, 2011 unless (a) your part-time employment period is extended for an additional period by mutual agreement between you and the Company or (b) your employment terminates earlier by reason of any of the events specified in Section 2 above. Upon the termination of your part-time employment with the Company, you will no longer render any services in any capacity to the Company or any of its affiliates. The unvested portion of your July 2, 2009 equity awards will be cancelled upon the termination of your part-time status.
     The following provisions will govern your period of parttime employment:
          (a) Depending on your duties, as they may be agreed upon from time to time, your services as a part-time employee may be performed at the Company's offices, via telecommuting and/or while traveling on Company business. In that regard, the Company and you will take reasonable steps to ensure you maintain connectivity via VPN and Blackberry or similar personal digital assistant device. You will at all times during the part-time employment period remain subject to the control and direction of the Company as to both the work to be performed and the manner and method of performance.
          (b) You will hold the title of Senior Advisor and will report directly to Dr. John Sperling, the Company's Executive Chair, and Terri Bishop, the Company's Executive Vice President, External Affairs, and Chief of Staff to the Executive Chair. The Company, in conjunction with those two executive officers, will, from time to time, delineate the specific duties and responsibilities you will have during this period, including the provision of transitional assistance and support to your successor.
          (c) You will remain subject to all employee workplace rules and standards.
          (d) Your base salary will be $5,000 per semi-monthly pay period, subject to the Company's collection of all applicable withholding taxes. You will not be eligible for any bonus compensation during your period of part-time employment.
          (e) You will not be eligible to participate in the Company's employee benefit plans, including the group health plans, the term insurance and disability plans and the employee stock purchase plan, but you may continue to make pre-tax contributions to the Company's 401(k) plan.
          (f) You will not be eligible to receive any new equity awards, including any awards for the 2011 or 2012 fiscal years.
          (g) You will continue to accrue service vesting credit with respect to the unvested portions of your September 1, 2007 and July 2, 2009 equity awards in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable equity award documents.
 
          (h) You will continue to be eligible for payment or reimbursement from the Company of business expenses for all of your continuing professional dues and licenses and for the reasonable costs of attending continuing legal education courses, subject to the Company's prior approval of each such expense and up to a maximum dollar reimbursement of Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00) in the aggregate.
     4. . Unless your employment with the Company terminates prior to October 31, 2010 by reason of any of the events listed in Section 2 above, your full-time employment will be deemed to have been terminated by the Company without Cause effective as of the close of business on October 31, 2010, and you will therefore be entitled to receive the severance compensation described in Section 8(b) of the Employment Agreement, subject to the conditions described therein and in this Section 4 and payable in accordance with the terms of the Employment Agreement and the applicable award agreements. This Transition Agreement shall constitute the "Notice of Termination" required by Section 7(e) of the Employment Agreement and no further notice of termination without Cause shall be required. For avoidance of doubt, you and the Company agree that such severance compensation under Section 8(b) of the Employment Agreement includes the following:
Severance Package
          (a) a cash severance amount (the "Cash Severance Benefit") equal to the sum of (i) $400,000 (one times your annual rate of base salary as of the date of this Transition Agreement) and (ii) one times the average of the actual annual bonuses you earned for the 2008, 2009 and 2010 fiscal years, with such amounts to be paid as follows: on May 2, 2011 (or upon your death, if earlier), you will receive in a lump sum the semi-monthly installments for the period from November 1, 2010 through April 30, 2011 that will have been delayed pursuant to Section 13(b) of your Employment Agreement, and the balance will be paid in twelve successive equal semi-monthly installments, beginning May 15, 2011; and
          (b) accelerated vesting on May 2 , 2011 (or upon your death, if earlier) of the final installment of your September 1, 2007 option grant and restricted stock unit award (the "Equity Severance Benefit").
     Although Section 8(b) of the Employment Agreement also provides for reimbursement for COBRA continuation costs, you hereby acknowledge that you will not be eligible for such reimbursement as part of your severance package because you do not carry health care coverage through the Company's group health plan.
     All payments made pursuant to the above-described severance package will be subject to the Company's collection of all applicable withholding taxes, and you will only receive the net amount remaining after such taxes have been withheld.
     As a condition to your right to receive both the Cash Severance and Equity Severance Benefits above described, you must execute and deliver to the Company a general release in the form of attached Exhibit A to this Transition Agreement, with such release as so amended to be dated April 22, 2011, and such release must become enforceable and effective by you not revoking it within the seven-day period in which you have to revoke it after signing.
 
     5. . You will have a three-month period following the date your employment with the Company terminates, in which to exercise the outstanding vested balance of your 110,000-share hire date option grant and the vested portion of your July 2, 2009 option grant (or twelve (12)-months in the event your employment terminates by reason of your death or Disability); provided, however, that in the event your employment is terminated by the Company other than for Cause prior to September 1, 2011, you will have until the later of (i) August 31, 2011 or (ii) the expiration of the three-month period following such termination in which to exercise the outstanding vested balance of the foregoing options. In no event, however, shall any option remain outstanding or exercisable beyond its maximum term.
Exercise Period Following Termination of Employment
     6. It is intended that this Transition Agreement and the payments hereunder will either be exempt from or otherwise satisfy the requirements of Section 409A(a)(2), (3) and (4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code"), including current and future guidance and regulations interpreting such provisions, and should be interpreted accordingly; provided, however, that the Company provides no assurances to you as to the actual treatment of those payments under Section 409A of the Code You hereby represent and acknowledge that you have retained your own legal counsel and obtained your own tax advice regarding the subject matter of this Transition Agreement and the payments to be made pursuant to it. Other than the Company's obligation to withhold federal, state and local taxes from your taxable wages, you will be responsible for any and all taxes, interest and penalties that may be imposed with respect to any of the payments and benefits that are made or provided to you in accordance with the terms of this Transition Agreement (including, without limitation, any and all tax implications under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A). You acknowledge and agree that the Company has not made any representations, and has not provided any advice, regarding the taxation of the payments and benefits that are to be provided you hereunder, including (without limitation) any potential taxes, interest and/or penalties under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and similar liabilities under state tax laws.

     This AGREEMENT is made as of , 2011, by and between P. Robert Moya ("Executive"), and Apollo Group, Inc. (the "Company").
                    
     In consideration for the severance benefits offered by the Company to Executive pursuant to Section 8 of his Employment Agreement with the Company dated August 31, 2007 and as subsequently amended effective January 1, 2009 (the "Employment Agreement"), Executive agrees as follows:
     1.  Executive acknowledges that his full-time employment with the Company terminated on October 31, 2010 and he currently remains in part-time employment with the Company pursuant to the terms of his Transition Agreement with the Company dated May ___, 2010 (the "Transition Agreement"), and he agrees that following the cessation of that part-time employment, he will not apply for or seek re-employment with the Company, its parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates after that date. Executive agrees that he has received all wages and accrued but unpaid vacation pay earned by him through the date of this Agreement, other than any unpaid wages attributable to his part-time employment during the payroll period in which this Agreement is executed.
Termination of Employment.
     2. 
Waiver and Release.
          (a) Except as set forth in Section 2(b), which identifies claims expressly excluded from this release, Executive hereby releases the Company, all affiliated companies, and their respective officers, directors, agents, employees, stockholders, successors and assigns from any and all claims, liabilities, demands, causes of action, costs, expenses, attorney fees, damages, indemnities and obligations of every kind and nature, in law, equity or otherwise, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising from or relating to Executive's employment with the Company through the date of this Agreement and the termination of his full-time employment with the Company and his executive officer positions, including (without limitation): claims of wrongful discharge, emotional distress, defamation, fraud, breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, discrimination claims based on sex, age, race, national origin, disability or any other basis under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended ("ADEA"), the Americans with Disability Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as amended, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, as amended, and any similar law of any state or governmental entity, any contract claims, tort claims and wage or benefit claims, including (without limitation) claims for salary, bonuses, commissions, equity awards (including stock grants, stock options and restricted stock units), vesting acceleration, vacation pay, fringe benefits, severance pay or any other form of compensation.
          (b) The only claims that Executive is not waiving and releasing under this Agreement are claims he may have for (1) unemployment, state disability, worker's compensation, and/or paid family leave insurance benefits pursuant to the terms of applicable state law; (2) continuation of existing participation in Company-sponsored group health benefit plans under the federal law known as "COBRA" and/or under an applicable state law counterpart(s); (3) any benefits entitlements that are vested and unpaid as of his termination date pursuant to the terms of a Company-sponsored benefit plan; (4) any benefits or rights to which he is entitled pursuant to Section 8 of the Employment Agreement or pursuant to the terms of his presently-outstanding equity awards from the Company, including the future vesting of those awards that occurs in accordance with the applicable award agreements and his post-employment exercise rights under Section 5 of the Transition Agreement, or his rights to indemnification pursuant to Section 15 of the Employment Agreement, (5) violation of any federal state or local statutory
 
and/or public policy right or entitlement that, by applicable law, is not waivable; and (6) any wrongful act or omission occurring after the date he executes this Agreement. In addition, nothing in this Agreement prevents or prohibits Executive from filing a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or any other government agency that is responsible for enforcing a law on behalf of the government and deems such claims not waivable. However, because Executive is hereby waiving and releasing all claims "for monetary damages and any other form of personal relief" (per Section 2(a) above), he may only seek and receive non-personal forms of relief from the EEOC and similar government agencies.
          (c) Executive represents that he has not filed any complaints, charges, claims, grievances, or lawsuits against the Company and/or any related persons with any local, state or federal agency or court, or with any other forum.
          (d) Executive acknowledges that he may discover facts different from or in addition to those he now knows or believes to be true with respect to the claims, demands, causes of action, obligations, damages, and liabilities of any nature whatsoever that are the subject of this Agreement, and he expressly agrees to assume the risk of the possible discovery of additional or different facts, and agrees that this Agreement shall be and remain in effect in all respects regardless of such additional or different facts. Executive expressly acknowledges that this Agreement is intended to include, and does include in its effect, without limitation, all claims which Executive does not know or suspect to exist in his favor against the Company and/or any related persons at the moment of execution thereof, and that this Agreement expressly contemplates extinguishing all such claims.
          (e) Executive understands and agrees that the Company has no obligation to provide him with any severance benefits under the Employment Agreement unless he executes this Agreement. Executive also understands that he has received or will receive, regardless of the execution of this Agreement, all wages and reimbursements owed to him, together with any accrued but unpaid vacation pay, less applicable withholdings and deductions, earned through the date of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect, impair or waive the Executive's right to receive any wages that become due and payable to him after the date of this Agreement by reason of his continued part-time employment pursuant to the Transition Agreement.
          (f) This Agreement is binding on Executive, his heirs, legal representatives and assigns.
     3. . This Agreement, the Employment Agreement and the Transition Agreement constitute the entire understanding and agreement between Executive and the Company in connection with the matters described, and replaces and cancels all previous agreements and commitments, whether spoken or written, with respect to such matters. Nothing in this Agreement supersedes or replaces any of Executive's obligations under his Employment Agreement or Transition Agreement that survive his termination of employment, including, but not limited to (i) his (and the Company's) agreement to arbitrate disputes, (ii) his restrictive covenants under Section 10 of the Employment Agreement and (iii) his obligations under Section 9 of the Employment Agreement, his existing Proprietary Information Inventions Agreement with the Company and any other obligations not to use or disclose Company confidential and/or proprietary information.
Entire Agreement
     4.  No oral agreement, statement, promise, commitment or representation shall alter or terminate the provisions of this Agreement. This Agreement cannot be changed or modified except by written agreement signed by Executive and authorized representatives of the Company.
Modification in Writing.
 
     5.  This Agreement shall be governed by and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Arizona.
Governing Law; Jurisdiction.
     6.  Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.
Severability.
     7.  This Agreement does not constitute an admission of any unlawful discriminatory acts or liability of any kind by the Company or anyone acting under their supervision or on their behalf. This Agreement may not be used or introduced as evidence in any legal proceeding, except to enforce or challenge its terms.
No Admission of Liability.
     8. . Executive is advised to consult with an attorney of his choice prior to executing this Agreement. By signing below, Executive acknowledges and certifies that he:

Vesting of New Equity Awards
 
          (i) The stock option component of each New Equity Award will vest in four (4) successive equal annual installments over the Executive's period of continued employment with the Company and will have a maximum term of six (6) years. Should the Executive's employment terminate for any reason other than (i) an involuntary termination for Cause (as such term is defined in Section 7(b) below), (ii) death or Disability (as such term is defined in Section 4(e) below) or (iii) a voluntary termination prior to August 31, 2012 other than for Good Reason (as such term is defined in Section 7(c) below), then each stock option will continue to vest in accordance with the foregoing vesting schedule, as if the Executive continued in employee status with the Company, and will remain exercisable, for any shares for which such option is at the time exercisable, until the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six (6)-year maximum term or (ii) the end of the twelve (12)-month period measured from the date on which the last annual installment of that stock option vests.
          (ii) The restricted stock unit component of each New Equity Award will have a performance-vesting condition tied to the fiscal year for such grant is awarded that will be the same as the performance-vesting condition applicable to the restricted stock unit awards made to the Company's other executive officers for that fiscal year. Upon the satisfaction of the applicable performance condition for the award, 25% of that award will vest on the last day of the fiscal year for which such award is made, with the shares of the Company's Class A common stock underlying that vested portion to be issued following the Compensation Committee's certification of the attained performance condition but not later than the close of the calendar year in which fiscal year ends, and the balance of the restricted stock units will vest, and the underlying shares issued, in three (3) successive equal annual installments, provided the Executive continues in the Company's employ through each such vesting date. However, should the Executive's employment terminate prior to the completion of the vesting schedule for any reason other than (i) an involuntary termination for Cause, (ii) death or Disability or (iii) a voluntary termination prior to August 31, 2012 other than for Good Reason, then the award will continue to vest (and the underlying shares issued) incrementally in accordance with the foregoing vesting schedule, as if the Executive continued in employee status with the Company.
          (iii) The performance unit/share component of each New Equity Award will have performance-vesting conditions measured over a performance period of one or more years that will be the same as for the other performance unit/share awards made to the Company's executive officers for the fiscal year for which that New Equity Award is made. Following the completion of the applicable performance period, the total number of shares of the Company's Class A common stock (if any) issuable under the award will be determined on the basis of the levels at which the applicable performance goals have in fact been attained. The number of shares so calculated will be issued to the Executive, following the Compensation Committee's certification of the level of performance goal attainment but not later than the close of the calendar year in which the performance period ends, provided (A) he continues in the Company's employ through the completion of the performance period or (B) there is an earlier termination of the Executive's employment for any reason other than (i) an involuntary termination for Cause, (ii) death or Disability or (iii) a voluntary termination prior to August 31, 2012 other than for Good Reason. In addition, should the Company's performance unit/share program in effect at the time such award is made to the Executive include any pro-rata vesting provisions, contingent upon performance goal attainment, for individuals who voluntarily leave the Company's employ prior to the completion of the performance period, then such provisions shall also be included in any performance unit/share award made to the Executive at that time.
          (iv) The continued vesting and exercisability of the stock options, the continued vesting of the restricted stock units and the vesting of the performance shares that is to occur, in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 4(d), following the Executive's termination of employment with the Company shall in each instance be subject to his compliance with the confidentiality obligations under Section 9 of this Amended and Restated Agreement and the restrictive
 
covenants set forth in Section 10 of this Amended and Restated Agreement. Upon a material breach of such obligations or covenants by the Executive, all further vesting of his equity awards pursuant to the provisions of this Section 4(d) shall cease, and the unexercised stock options granted to the Executive as part of the New Equity Awards pursuant to Section 4(c) of this Amended and Restated Agreement shall immediately terminate.
     (e) Each component of the New Equity Awards made to the Executive pursuant to Section 4(c) of this Amended and Restated Agreement will also be subject to the partial vesting acceleration provisions of this Section 4(e) should his employment terminate by reason of death or Disability (as such term is defined below).

          (i) Should the Executive's employment with the Company terminate by reason of his death or Disability, the stock option component of each New Equity Award will immediately vest as to a portion of the unvested shares of the Company's Class A common stock subject to that option, and the option will remain exercisable for the vested shares for a twelve (12)-month period following his death or Disability, but not beyond the maximum six (6)-year term of the option. The number of shares that would vest on such an accelerated basis would be equal to the number of additional shares (if any) in which the Executive would have vested had he completed an additional eighteen (18) months of service following his death or Disability.
          (ii) No shares will be issued under any of the performance-based restricted stock unit or performance unit/share components of the New Equity Awards until the completion of the applicable performance period. At that time there will be determined the total number of shares (if any) issuable under the award based on the levels at which the applicable performance goals have in fact been attained and assuming the Executive had continued in the Company's employ through the completion of the applicable vesting schedule. Should any earlier termination of such employment occur by reason of the Executive's death or Disability, a portion of the total number of shares as calculated in accordance with the foregoing will vest on an accelerated basis, upon the later of (A) such termination of employment or (B) the completion of the applicable performance period. The accelerated portion will be equal to the number of additional shares (if any) in which the Executive would have vested had he completed an additional eighteen (18) months of service following the date of his death or Disability, and such accelerated portion shall be issued no later than the of (x) the fifteenth day of the third calendar month following the date of the Executive's death or Disability or (y) the end of the calendar year in which such death or Disability occurs; that in the event the Executive's Disability does not satisfy the definition of Permanent Disability below and the applicable award agreement is otherwise subject to Code Section 409A, the accelerated portion shall be issued on each applicable date on which the accelerated shares would have otherwise vested and become issuable, in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement, had Executive continued in employee status over that eighteen (18)-month period for which service credit is given hereunder.

Upon the expiration of the applicable deferral period, all payments deferred pursuant to this Section 13(b) shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum, and any remaining payments due under this Amended and Restated Agreement shall be paid in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein. The specified employees subject to such a delayed commencement date shall be identified on December 31 of each calendar year.

In no event shall any 409A Gross-Up Payment to which the Executive becomes entitled hereunder be made later than the of (i) the end of the calendar year in which the related Section 409A Penalty Tax is remitted to the appropriate tax authorities or (ii) the end of the sixty (60)-day period measured from the date such tax is so remitted.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF,
 
 
          This AGREEMENT is made as of , 201___, by and between Joseph L. D'Amico ("Executive"), and Apollo Group, Inc. (the "Company").
                    
          In consideration for the severance benefits offered by the Company to Executive pursuant to Section 8 of his Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with the Company dated , 2010 (the "Employment Agreement"), Executive agree as follows:
                    
     1.  Executive acknowledges that his employment with the Company is terminated effective (the "Termination Date"), and he agrees that he will not apply for or seek re-employment with the Company, its parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates after that date. Executive agrees that he has received and reviewed his final paycheck and he has received all wages and accrued but unpaid vacation pay earned by him through the Termination Date.
Termination of Employment.
                    
     2. 
Waiver and Release.
          (a) Except as set forth in Section 2(b), which identifies claims expressly excluded from this release, Executive hereby releases the Company, all affiliated companies, and their respective officers, directors, agents, employees, stockholders, successors and assigns from any and all claims, liabilities, demands, causes of action, costs, expenses, attorney fees, damages, indemnities and obligations of every kind and nature, in law, equity or otherwise, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising from or relating to Executive's employment with the Company and the termination of that employment, including (without limitation): claims of wrongful discharge, emotional distress, defamation, fraud, breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, discrimination claims based on sex, age, race, national origin, disability or any other basis under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended ("ADEA"), the Americans with Disability Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as amended, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, as amended, and any similar law of any state or governmental entity, any contract claims, tort claims and wage or benefit claims, including (without limitation) claims for salary, bonuses, commissions, equity awards (including stock grants, stock options and restricted stock units), vesting acceleration, vacation pay, fringe benefits, severance pay or any other form of compensation.
          (b) The only claims that Executive is not waiving and releasing under this Agreement are claims he may have for (1) unemployment, state disability, worker's compensation, and/or paid family leave insurance benefits pursuant to the terms of applicable state law; (2) continuation of existing participation in Company-sponsored group health benefit plans under the federal law known as "COBRA" and/or under an applicable state law counterpart(s); (3) any benefits entitlements that are vested and unpaid as of his termination date pursuant to the terms of a Company-sponsored benefit plan; (4) any benefits to which he is entitled pursuant to Section 8 of the Employment Agreement or his rights to indemnification pursuant to Section 15 of the Employment Agreement, (5) violation of any federal state or local statutory and/or public policy right or entitlement that, by applicable law, is not waivable; and (6) any wrongful act or omission occurring after the date he executes this Agreement. In addition, nothing in this Agreement prevents or prohibits Executive from filing a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or any other government agency that is responsible for enforcing a law on behalf of the government and deems such claims not waivable. However, because Executive is hereby waiving and releasing all claims "for monetary damages and any other form of personal relief" (per Section 2(a) above), he may only seek and receive non-personal forms of relief from the EEOC and similar government agencies.
 
          (c) Executive represents that he has not filed any complaints, charges, claims, grievances, or lawsuits against the Company and/or any related persons with any local, state or federal agency or court, or with any other forum.
          (d) Executive acknowledges that he may discover facts different from or in addition to those he now knows or believes to be true with respect to the claims, demands, causes of action, obligations, damages, and liabilities of any nature whatsoever that are the subject of this Agreement, and he expressly agrees to assume the risk of the possible discovery of additional or different facts, and agrees that this Agreement shall be and remain in effect in all respects regardless of such additional or different facts. Executive expressly acknowledges that this Agreement is intended to include, and does include in its effect, without limitation, all claims which Executive does not know or suspect to exist in his favor against the Company and/or any related persons at the moment of execution thereof, and that this Agreement expressly contemplates extinguishing all such claims.
          (e) Executive understands and agrees that the Company has no obligation to provide him with any severance benefits under the Employment Agreement unless he executes this Agreement. Executive also understands that he has received or will receive, regardless of the execution of this Agreement, all wages owed to him, together with any accrued but unpaid vacation pay, less applicable withholdings and deductions, earned through the Termination Date.
          (f) This Agreement is binding on Executive, his heirs, legal representatives and assigns.
     3. . This Agreement and the Employment Agreement constitute the entire understanding and agreement between Executive and the Company in connection with the matters described, and replaces and cancels all previous agreements and commitments, whether spoken or written, with respect to such matters. Nothing in this Agreement supersedes or replaces any of Executive's obligations under his Employment Agreement that survive termination, including, but not limited to (i) his (and the Company's) agreement to arbitrate disputes, (ii) his restrictive covenants under Section 10 of the Employment Agreement and (iii) his obligations under Section 9 of the Employment Agreement, his existing Proprietary Information Inventions Agreement with the Company and any other obligations not to use or disclose Company confidential and/or proprietary information.
Entire Agreement
     4.  No oral agreement, statement, promise, commitment or representation shall alter or terminate the provisions of this Agreement. This Agreement cannot be changed or modified except by written agreement signed by Executive and authorized representatives of the Company.
Modification in Writing.
     5.  This Agreement shall be governed by and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Arizona.
Governing Law; Jurisdiction.
     6.  Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.
Severability.
 
     7.  This Agreement does not constitute an admission of any unlawful discriminatory acts or liability of any kind by the Company or anyone acting under their supervision or on their behalf. This Agreement may not be used or introduced as evidence in any legal proceeding, except to enforce or challenge its terms.
No Admission of Liability.
     8. . Executive is advised to consult with an attorney of his choice prior to executing this Agreement. By signing below, Executive acknowledges and certifies that he:
Acknowledgements
          (a) has read and understands all of the terms of this Agreement and is not relying on any representations or statements, written or oral, not set forth in this Agreement;
          (b) has been provided a consideration period of twenty-one calendar days within which to decide whether he will execute this Agreement and that no one hurried him into executing this Agreement;
          (c) is signing this Agreement knowingly and voluntarily; and
          (d) has the right to revoke this Agreement within seven (7) days after signing it, by providing written notice of revocation via certified mail to the Company to the address specified in the Employment Agreement.

     Because of the revocation period, the Company's obligations under this Agreement shall not become effective or enforceable until the eighth (8th) calendar day after the date Executive signs this Agreement provided he has delivered it to the Company without modification and not revoked it (the "Effective Date").

(d) Exhibits.
The following exhibits are provided herewith:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
PHOENIX, June 21, 2010  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:APOL) today announced that subsidiary University of Phoenix has received the Final Program Review Determination Letter associated with its February 2009 program review by the U.S. Department of Education (Department) and that the University has successfully completed the corrective actions and satisfied the obligations arising from the review.
"We are pleased to have successfully resolved the findings reported by the Department through a collaborative and productive process," said Joseph L. D'Amico, president and chief operating officer of Apollo Group, Inc. "In so doing, we have adopted a series of processes and procedures to further strengthen our already rigorous internal controls and administrative capability."
As required, Apollo has posted a Letter of Credit in the amount of approximately $125 million to comply with the Department's standards of financial responsibility. The Department's regulations require institutions to post a Letter of Credit where a program review report cites untimely return of unearned Title IV funds for more than 10 percent of the sampled students in a period covered by the review.
Of the six findings contained in the Final Program Review Determination Letter, three related to University of Phoenix's procedures for determining student withdrawal dates and associated timing of the return of unearned Title IV funds, which averaged no more than six days outside the required timeframe in the affected sample files. Importantly, there were no findings that indicated incorrect amounts of Title IV funds had been returned. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2010, Apollo made payments totaling $660,000 to reimburse the Department for the cost of Title IV funds associated with these findings.
 
The remaining findings involved isolated clerical errors verifying student-supplied information and, as self-reported by University of Phoenix in 2008, the calculation of student financial need where students were eligible for tuition and fee waivers and discounts, and the use of Title IV funds for non-program purposes such as transcripts, applications and late fees.

B. Scope of Review
The U.S. Department of Education (the Department) conducted a review of the student financial assistance programs administered by the University of Phoenix (UOP) from February 23, 2009 to February 27, 2009. Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, 20 U.S.C.  1070 . (Title IV, HEA programs). The review was conducted by Donna Wittman, Marcia Clark, Dale Hillard, and Frank Reyes.
et seq
Based upon an analysis of the Department's data, the Department determined that UOP had a significant number of occurrences in the following areas:
A sample of 30 files for each of these characteristics (a total of 90 files) was identified for review for two award years as follows:
Appendix A lists the names and social security numbers of the students whose files were examined during the program review. A program review report (PRR) was issued on December 28, 2009. Appendix A contains personally identifying information and will be provided to UOP in an encrypted electronic format.
Disclaimer:

Although the review was thorough, it cannot be assumed to be all-inclusive. The absence of statements in the report concerning UOP's specific practices and procedures must not be construed as acceptance, approval, or endorsement of those specific practices and procedures. Furthermore, the absence of such statements does not relieve UOP of its obligation to comply with all of the statutory or regulatory provisions governing the Title IV, HEA programs.
C. Findings and Final Determinations
Resolved Findings
Findings 4-6.
UOP has taken the corrective actions necessary to resolve findings 4-6 of the PRR. Therefore, these findings may be considered closed. University of Phoenix, "Program Review Report Response," April 30, 2010. Findings that are resolved and addressed with further comment are discussed below.
Resolved Findings with Comments
The following program review findings have been resolved by UOP, and may be considered closed. These findings are included solely for the purpose of discussing resolution of the finding. A copy of the PRR issued on December 28, 2009 is attached as Appendix C.
Finding 1. Return To Title IV (R2T4) Funds Made Late
Citation Summary:
When a student withdraws from an institution, the institution must return any unearned Title IV funds within 45 days after the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew. 34 C.F.R.  668.22(j). The date of an institution's determination that the student withdrew is defined by regulation as:
 
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 6
Noncompliance Summary:
Out of the 90 files reviewed by the Department, 49 Title IV recipients withdrew from UOP during the award years reviewed. Unearned Title IV funds were due in the case of 48 Title IV recipients. In the case of eight students, Title IV funds were not returned timely. These late returns represent two out of 23 (9%) for the 2007-2008 award year and six out of 21 (29%) for the 2008-2009 award year.
Required Action Summary:
Due to the high error rate for the 2008-2009 award year (29%), UOP must reimburse the Department for the cost of Title IV funds paid untimely for the 2008-2009 award year. In order to identify such liability, UOP was given the option of performing a full file review of all students for whom R2T4 was paid for the 2008-2009 award year, of reviewing and reporting for statistically random sample files chosen by the Department, or by identifying the liability on the basis of a projection of liability using the data in the statistical sample used in the PRR.
UOP was further required to establish policies and procedures to assure the timely payment of R2T4 funds for students who withdraw.
In its response, UOP chose to use the PRR statistical sample to identify the liability for this finding. Such sample yielded a projected liability of $659,296.44 for the costs to the Department of the late R2T4. UOP further submitted a bank draft for $659,296.44 in payment of the liability. UOP further implemented policies and procedures that it claims will ensure timely processing of R2T4 funds. Appendix D, pp. 3  5.
UOP's Response:
2
See
Final Determination:
While UOP returned Title IV funds due to student withdrawals, it returned them untimely. UOP's liability, therefore, is for the cost to the Department for the delayed return of funds. The Department projected liabilities based on the results of a review of the valid statistical sample used in the PRR. An average liability for the cost of funds was calculated for the statistical sample ($4,738), and this average was multiplied against the population (139,141) being reviewed. Therefore, the projected liability for the cost of the funds for this finding is $659,296.44 payable to the Department.
Due to the number of unpaid and late refunds, UOP is required to have on file with the Department an irrevocable Letter of Credit (LOC) equal to 25% of the total refunds the
 
 
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 7
institution paid, or should have paid, during the most recently closed fiscal year (34 C.F.R.  668.173(d)). Prior to issuance of this FPRD, UOP resolved this requirement by submitting the required letter of credit acceptable and payable to the Secretary. Accordingly, this finding is resolved.
Finding 2. Financial Need Incorrectly Determined
Citation Summary:
A student's total financial aid and other estimated financial assistance may not exceed a student's financial need as determined under  428 of the HEA. Estimated Financial Assistance (EFA) is defined as the estimated amount of assistance for a period of enrollment that a student or a parent will receive from Federal, State, institutional, or other sources, such as, scholarships, grants, net earnings from need-based employment, or loans, including, but not limited to, any educational benefits paid because of enrollment in a postsecondary education institution, or to cover post-secondary education expenses. 34 C.F.R.  682.200(b).
If an institution treats a waiver as a payment of tuition and fees charged to a student, then that waiver of tuition and fees would be considered as a financial aid resource and the cost of attendance calculation would include the full amount of the tuition and fees. DCL GEN-00-24 (December 2000).
2008-2009 Federal Student Aid Handbook, 3-20.

In no case may a FFEL or FDL amount exceed the student's estimated cost of attendance (COA) less
Noncompliance Summary:
UOP has a number of sales promotions where it waives fees of varying amounts. One such program is UOP's Education Tuition Program for employees in good standing that provides a waiver for 100% of the tuition and certain other fees, as well as a waiver of 80% of the tuition for family members. UOP's practice was to post full charges to students' ledgers, then post any waiver or discount as a credit adjustment to ledgers. When packaging Title IV aid, UOP did not adjust the EFA to take these various fee waivers and discounts into account.
UOP personnel stated that they had never included discounts and waivers in the EFA when calculating need. UOP discovered this error in an internal audit that reviewed the need calculations for 100 randomly chosen files. Out of these 100 files, it found that 62 included fee waivers with potential overawards. Out of these 62 files, UOP found that five students received Title IV overawards totaling $17,000. Due to this discovery, UOP stated that it had undertaken the review of the files of all students receiving employee
 
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 8
tuition waivers during the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 award years. UOP officials, however, also stated that disregarding such fee waivers and discounts would rarely result in a Title IV overaward.
Required Action Summary:
The PRR required UOP to continue its file review of all students who received employee tuition benefits during the 2007-08 and 2008-09 award years and submit a report of such review to the Department. UOP was directed to recalculate the EFA and need of each of these students, and determine whether an overaward occurred and the extent of any overaward. UOP was further required to engage an independent public accountant (IPA) to test UOP's review.
UOP was also required to establish and implement policies and procedures that will assure that any adjustment to tuition and/or fees, including, but not limited to, "promotional" adjustments, "discounts," "waivers," or other credit adjustments known or contracted for at the time of a student's enrollment, are included in the EFA when calculating need for any Title IV recipient.
In its response, UOP noted that the cost of attendance (COA) at UOP will usually exceed the financial assistance received by students. UOP determined, however, that its employee tuition assistance benefits were not consistently included in the EFA when financial need was determined. UOP conducted the required file review and submitted a report of its review, together with the required independent public accountant attestation with its response. Its review revealed overpayments of FFEL funds totaling $1,146,351 for 539 students in the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 award years.
UOP's Response:

In response to the PRR, UOP also returned overpayment amounts to the individual FFEL accounts of students.
UOP further implemented procedures that it claims will assure that all financial resources are included in the EFA for all students when financial need is determined.
UOP is liable for the return of all overpayments caused by its failure to correctly determine the financial need of students who received employee tuition assistance. UOP has returned the overpaid funds as required and implemented corrective action. This finding is resolved and no further action is required. In its next scheduled annual audit, UOP's auditor must comment on the effectiveness of the corrective action taken to resolve this finding.
Final Determination:

Required Action Summary:
UOP was directed to review the files, complete verification, and recalculate the EFCs to determine whether overawards occurred. UOP was advised that if unable to properly verify information for the two students, it would be liable for the return of Title IV funds, together with the cost of the funds to the Department.
In its response, UOP recalculated the EFC for Student #77, using data corrections. The student had withdrawn and Title IV funds were returned. The recalculation resulted in no change in the student's eligibility. As to Student #84, UOP was unable to verify the student's 2006-2007 Institutional Student Information Report (ISIR) with the correct income tax return. UOP appropriately returned the Title IV funds disbursed to the student, $9,379.37 ($2,025 Pell, $7,354.37 FFEL). UOP further submitted a bank draft for $1,530.03 with its response to pay for the cost of the funds to the Department.
UOP's Response:
UOP is liable for the return of funds disbursed to Student #84 during the 2006-2007 award year, as well as the cost of such funds to the Department as follows:
Final Determination:
 
 
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 10
UOP has returned the Title IV funds disbursed and submitted payment for the cost of funds to the Department. Accordingly, this finding is resolved and requires no further action.

B. Scope of Review
The U.S. Department of Education (Department) conducted a program review at the University of Phoenix (UOP) from February 23, 2009 to February 27, 2009. The review was conducted by Donna Wittman, Marcia Clark, Dale Hillard, and Frank Reyes.
Based upon an analysis of the Department's data, the Department determined that UOP had a significant number of occurrences in the following areas:
A sample of 30 files for each of these characteristics (a total of 90 files) was identified for review for two award years as follows:
The names and Social Security Numbers of all 90 students are identified on Appendix A to the Program Review Report. Appendix A contains personally identifying information and will be provided to UOP in an encrypted electronic format.
Disclaimer:
Although the review was thorough, it cannot be assumed to be all-inclusive. The absence of statements in the report concerning UOP's specific practices and procedures must not be construed as acceptance, approval, or endorsement of those specific practices and procedures. Furthermore, the absence of such statements does not relieve UOP of its

obligation to comply with all of the statutory or regulatory provisions governing the Title IV, HEA programs.
This report reflects initial findings. These findings are not final. The Department will issue its final findings in a subsequent Final Program Review Determination (FPRD) letter.
C. Findings
During the review, the Department noted several areas of noncompliance. Findings of noncompliance are referenced to the applicable statutes and regulations and specify the actions to be taken by UOP to bring operations of the financial aid programs into compliance with statutes and regulations.
Finding 1. Return To Title IV (R2T4) Funds Made Late
When a student withdraws from an institution, the institution must return any unearned Title IV funds within 45 days after the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew. 34 C.F.R.  668.22(j). The date of an institution's determination that the student withdrew is defined by regulation as:
Citation:
34 C.F. R.  668.22(1)(3), 34 C.F.R.  668.22(b) and (c).
"Official notification to the institution" is a notice of intent to withdraw that a student provides to an office designated by the institution. 34 C.F.R.  668.22(c)(5). An institution may allow a student to rescind his or her official notification to withdraw by filing a written statement that he or she is continuing to participate in academically-related activities and intends to complete the payment period or period of enrollment. If, however, the student subsequently ceases to attend the institution prior to the end of the payment period or period

University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 5
of enrollment, the student's rescission is negated and the withdrawal date is the student's original date of withdrawal. 34 C.F.R.  668.22(c)(2).
If a student proceeds to attend after notifying an institution of withdrawal, an institution that is not required to take attendance may choose to use the student's last date of attendance as the withdrawal date, provided that the institution documents that the activity of the student after giving notice of withdrawal is:
34 C.F.R.  668.22(c)(3).
Institutions are required, upon the request of enrolled students, to make the requirements and procedures for officially withdrawing readily available. 34 C.F.R.  668.43(a)(3).
An institution must also document a student's withdrawal date and maintain the documentation as of the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew. 34 C.F.R 668.22(c)(4).
.
In early 2008 , UOP sought to meet with the Department to discuss recent changes at UOP. In response to UOP's request, UOP personnel met with the Department on March 28, 2008. At this meeting, UOP was advised that the Department had received a number of complaints in 2008 that:
Noncompliance:
2
 
 
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 20
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 6
At this meeting. the Department provided UOP a written memorandum that summarized the complaints and identified eight complainants. The memorandum provided to UOP at the meeting set forth the following conclusions:
Information should be readily provided to students who express the desire to withdraw to their Instructors, Enrollment Counselors, or Financial Counselors.
For students who express the desire to withdraw by phone, email, or Official Withdrawal Form, the withdrawal process must start as of that date. The "29 days out of attendance" policy should not apply in these cases.
3
Safeguards should be in place to prevent credit balance checks from being sent to students who have expressed a desire to withdraw and who have ceased attendance.
4
Information regarding a student's financial aid disposition and the status of his or her account with the University of Phoenix should be provided to students as soon as possible.
During the July 7, 2009 exit conference with UOP officials, UOP indicated that it had taken action to address the concerns of the Department as stated in the March 2008 meeting. UOP stated that it revised its withdrawal process in June 2008 and August 2008 to provide "more clarity to staff about processing of withdrawals and actions that must be taken by the staff." On July 14, 2009, UOP provided the program reviewers with copies of documents reflecting the 2008 revisions and described training and directions given to staff to address the problem of failing to treat students' attempts to withdraw as withdrawal notification.
Review of the student files in the program review process revealed however, that throughout 2008, UOP continued to fail to timely withdraw students who expressed a desire to withdraw, resulting in UOP's untimely return of Title IV funds. Further, the documents reflecting UOP's 2008 revisions and directions to staff were inconsistent and conflicted with existing UOP policies regarding determination of a student's withdrawal.
 
 
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 21

UOP's "Standard Office Procedure  Official Withdrawal" dated August 25, 2008, provides:
5
The official withdrawal process needs to be completed for any financial aid student (past or present) taking a break of attendance greater than 29 days (21 days for students attending a Georgia campus) without a Leave of Absence or who is completely withdrawing from the University. The Official Withdrawal Form needs to be completed and processed in order to properly reconcile the student's account and meet the Department of Education's Title IV guidelines.
A student who has received financial aid through University of Phoenix at any time notifies his or her counselor that s/he is requesting to officially withdraw or take a break greater than 29 days (or 21 days for students attending Georgia campus).
The procedure then directs that enrollment, academic, and finance counselors are to make efforts to retain the student or to have the student complete an Official Withdrawal Form. The finance counselor is also to review whether a leave of absence is appropriate and perform the final processing of the student's withdrawal in the UOP system.
This UOP "Official Withdrawal" policy does not address a date of determination of withdrawal. It simply describes the internal procedure for processing a withdrawal. The issue of a date of determination is set forth in the undated UOP procedure entitled "Withdrawal Date  Date of Determination of Withdrawal." This document states that UOP will determine the withdrawal date within 30 days of a student's last date of attendance or the failure of a student to return from a scheduled leave of absence. Neither the "Official Withdrawal" procedure, nor the "Date of Determination" procedure provide for treatment of a student's notice of withdrawal as an actual date of withdrawal or date of determination.
Among the documents provided by UOP in July 2009 to show action taken in response to the March 2008 Department concerns, was an email dated May 29, 2008 to enrollment counselors and financial aid staff addressing the multiple options for completion of the Official Withdrawal Form. This email indicates that: "A student notifies the Campus that
 
 
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 22
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 8
they intend to cease attendance by completing an Official Withdrawal Form." While the email indicates that the Official Withdrawal Form can be completed by the student or UOP on behalf of a student who refuses to complete the form, the email does not indicate, as the "Official Withdrawal" process does, that a student may withdraw by telephone, email, letter, or in person.
Out of the 90 files reviewed by the Department, 49 Title IV recipients withdrew from UOP during the award years reviewed. Unearned Title IV funds were due in the case of 48 Title IV recipients. In the case of eight students, Title IV funds were not returned timely. These late returns represent two out of 23(9%) for the 2007-2008 award year and six out of 21 (29%) for the 2008-2009 award year. Specifically:

2007-2008 Award Year:
called UOP on April 7, 2008 and notified UOP that she withdrew from the program because she was not happy with the classes. Specifically, the UOP academic counselor noted: "The stu (sic) called me because she wants to drop from the program. She said that she is not happy with these classes." When the UOP academic counselor told her that she would be financially responsible for two weeks of attendance, the student replied that she did not care. On that day, the UOP finance counselor emailed the student and acknowledged the student's decision to withdraw from the program. The UOP counselor further notified her that "your last day of class will be today," and advised her that after 29 days of absence, a calculation will be made to determine the amount of financial aid earned.
Student #6
The student did not return to UOP after April 7, 2008. UOP did process the student's account for account collection purposes on April 8, 2008. As to Title IV, however, UOP did not treat the student as a withdrawal until she had 34 days of consecutive absences, and then entered May 11, 2008 as the "date of determination" for R2T4 purposes. UOP returned unearned FFEL funds to the lender on May 27, 2008, 50 days after the student notified UOP that she was withdrawing.
last date of attendance was July 22, 2007 according to UOP's attendance records. This online student advised UOP on July 24, 2007 that she was withdrawing because she was moving, would have no internet service, and would mail back the credit balance check that had been provided to her a week earlier. On August 2, 2007, UOP updated the student's account to "WITHDRAWN COURSE" and initiated the automated drop adjustment process for billing purposes. Instead of treating the student as a withdrawal when she gave notice on July 24, 2007, UOP waited until 35 days after the student's last date of attendance and entered August

26, 2007 as the "date of determination" for Title IV purposes. UOP returned unearned Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) funds to the lender on September 17, 2007, 55 days after the student notified UOP that she was withdrawing.
2008-2009 Award Year:
last date of attendance was October 9, 2008. On October 10, 2008, the student called her UOP academic counselor and said that she needed to withdraw from her one class due to personal, family reasons. The academic counselor told the student that she would have to talk with the finance counselor, who was out of town. She was also advised that financial aid would not be available to pay for her attendance to date. On October 23, 2008, the student confirmed to the academic counselor that she withdrew. On October 25, 2008, UOP treated the student as a withdrawal for purposes of billing the student by initiating the "Automated Drop Adjustment Process" in its student account system.
Student #21's
As to Title IVhowever, UOP did not treat the student as a withdrawal until she had been absent for 31 days  a date that was 30 days after the student actually withdrew. UOP then entered November 9, 2008 as the "date of determination" for R2T4 purposes.

UOP returned unearned FFEL funds to the lender on November 26, 2008, 47 days after the student notified UOP that she was withdrawing.
began attending UOP on September 23, 2008. There was no documentation in the student's files indicating that the student had been notified of the total tuition and costs. When she received a credit balance check on October 15, 2008, the student sent an email to UOP wanting to know why it was so small, that she had expected more, and that she had to have at least $2,000 to pay for school supplies, equipment, room, and board. The student stated that she needed a "more tuition friendly school" because "I do not want all my financial aid eaten up in tuition." The student's last documented date of attendance was during the week ending October 20, 2008.
Student #27
On October 29, 2008, the enrollment advisor confirmed that the student "said she's not continuing." On October 30, 2008, UOP updated the student's account code to "WITHDRAWN COURSE" and treated the student as a withdrawal for billing purposes. (The student was enrolled in only one course.) Additional notes made on November 1 and November 6 noted the student's withdrawn status. Finally, after 34 days of consecutive absences, UOP entered November 23, 2008 as the "date of determination" when it calculated R2T4. UOP returned unearned FFEL funds to the lender on December 11, 2008, 57 days after the student notified UOP that she was withdrawing and 52 days after the end of the student's last week of attendance.

last date of attendance was October 18, 2008. On October 22, 2008, he notified UOP that he withdrew. advising that "I would like to drop out of my classes because I don't have time to do the classes and spend time with my family." UOP withdrew the student from his classes on November 1, 2008 for billing purposes. UOP did not return unearned Title IV funds of $4,702.50 FFEL funds and $2,013 in Pell funds until December 8, 2008, 49 days after the student notified UOP that he had withdrawn.
Student #29's
enrolled in UOP's Master of Business Administration/Accounting (MBA/Accounting) program comprised of 54 credits. On September 16, 2008, the student successfully completed 39 MBA credits  enough to graduate with a general MBA. He proceeded to his next scheduled class to work toward the MBA/Accounting degree, but ceased attending on October 13, 2008. On October 17, 2008, he sent an email to his academic counselor asking to change his program to a general MBA  the degree for which he had already completed coursework.
Student #49
He advised UOP by email on October 23, 2008 that: "I would like to finish here, with a standard MBA. I am withdrawing the current class." (The student was enrolled in only one class.) On October 29, 2008, UOP updated the student's account to "WITHDRAWN COURSE" and initiated the automated drop adjustment process for billing purposes. Instead of treating the student as a withdrawal when he gave notice on October 23, 2008, UOP waited until 34 days of consecutive absences, and entered November 16, 2008 as the date of determination when it calculated R2T4. UOP returned unearned FFEL funds to the lender on December 8, 2008, 46 days after the student notified UOP that he had withdrawn.
last date of attendance was during the week ending September 7, 2008. On September 8, 2008, the student called her UOP finance counselor who noted:
Student #58's
The student said she was not aware she would be taking out student loan funding. She would like to cancel these funds and drop. I explained the cost of 2 weeks of attendance and sent her the official cancellation form. I asked that she speak with her EC before making her final decision.
After this notification that she had withdrawn, the UOP enrollment counselor emailed and called the student a number of times regarding her absence. The enrollment counselor noted that he spoke with the student on September 17, 2008 and that the student said she was very busy and would have to make time to go to class. No documentation in the file indicated that the student rescinded her withdrawal or attended at any time after notifying UOP of her wish to withdraw.

UOP returned unearned funds for Student #58 on October 28, 2008, 50 days after the student first notified UOP of her wish to withdraw. When it performed the R2T4 calculation, UOP noted the date of determination as October 12, 2008, 34 days after September 8, 2008, the date on which the student notified UOP of her wish to withdraw.
file indicated a last date of attendance of July 30, 2008. On June 5, 2008, the student spoke with UOP and stated that she was "very upset," complained about her class, said she felt misled by the enrollment counselor, and was going to transfer to another institution. On June 10, 2008, UOP noted that the student was "taking a break" from class, but no leave of absence (LOA) appeared in the record. The next day, June 11, 2008, UOP received an email from the student advising that she needed a break longer than two weeks. UOP noted that the student emailed on July 31, 2008, that "I will need 4 weeks. I can't start right away."
Student #75's
Finally, on August 4, 2008, UOP received the following email from the student:
As I stated before I have too many other responsibilities and obligations to continue on in the Masters Program and I am dropping the current course and will not be attending any future courses.
When the program reviewers interviewed the student during and after the program review site visit, the student stated that when she tried to withdraw, UOP would not let her withdraw due to the adverse effect on financial aid. The student further stated that when UOP would not let her withdraw, she "took a break" and UOP proceeded to sign her up in a second class without her permission. The student indicated that she emailed her instructor on a number of occasions stating that she had to withdraw, finally emailing on August 4, 2008 that "I am dropping the current course and will not be attending any future courses."
On August 19, 2008, UOP initiated the automated drop adjustment process for billing purposes. Instead of treating the student as a withdrawal when she gave notice on June 5, 2008, UOP disregarded the student's notice and entered September 7, 2008 as the "date of determination" for Title IV purposes. UOP returned unearned FFEL funds to the lender on September 29, 2008, 56 days after the student's last date of attendance and documented academically-related activity.
The above files evidence that:
 
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCE 200920926841 Page 26
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 12
The program reviewers advised UOP that the error rate of late return of Title IV funds for 2008-2009 files (29%) required a determination of the cost to the Department of the funds paid late. UOP was advised that it is the Department's procedure to require a file review of all files or to project the liability based on review of a random statistical sample. UOP requested that the Department provide it the opportunity to resolve the costs associated with this finding by projecting liability on the basis of the program review sample (21 files with R2T4 for 2008-09), rather than a full statistical sample of 383 files.
10
Due to the high error rate for the 2008-2009 award year (29%), UOP must reimburse the Department for the cost of Title IV funds paid untimely for the 2008-2009 award year. Upon consideration of UOP's request to determine such costs based on projection of the program review sample of 21 R2T4 files for 2008-2009, the Department has determined that UOP's liability may be determined on the basis of one of three methodologies as set forth below.
Required Action:
 
 
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 27
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 13
In the event UOP opts to determine the cost to the Department based on a review of a random statistical sample (Option 2, above) or a review of the entire population for whom R2T4 was due (Option 3, above), UOP must review the files to determine the date on which each student in the sample began the withdrawal process by providing notice to UOP, the date on which the student otherwise provided official notification to the institution, in writing or orally, of his or her intent to withdraw. If UOP contends that subsequent attendance by the student constitutes a rescission of withdrawal, it must have a written statement from the student that he or she is continuing to participate in academically-related activities and intends to complete the payment period or period of enrollment. If the student, however, subsequently ceased to attend UOP prior to the end of the payment period or period of enrollment, the student's rescission is negated and the withdrawal date is the student's original date of withdrawal. UOP must determine the correct date of determination and extent of timeliness of R2T4.
If UOP opts to conduct a file review (of either a random sample or of the entire R2T4 population for 2008-2009), in response to this Program Review Report, UOP must provide a report that sets forth the results of its review with the following information for each student for whom R2T4 was not made within 45 days of the date of determination:

The IPA must prepare the report in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Attestations Standards. The IPA's report must be submitted with UOP's response to this Program Review Report.
UOP will be liable for the cost of R2T4 funds not timely paid. The amount of liability for this finding will be identified as $659,296.44 if UOP opts to determine liability on the basis of the program review sample (Option 1, above). If UOP opts to perform a file review, the liability will be identified in the FPRD.
In addition to the file review as described above, UOP must establish and implement policies and procedures that will assure that when students provide notice of withdrawal, that it treats such notice as the date of determination and returns Title IV funds timely. UOP must also establish and implement procedures that will assure that students who request withdrawal be provided an explanation of the requirements and procedures for officially withdrawing. A copy of such policies and procedures must be provided with the response to this Program Review Report.
Finding 2. Financial Need Incorrectly Determined
A student's total financial aid and other estimated financial assistance may not exceed a student's financial need as determined under  428 of the HEA. Estimated Financial Assistance (EFA) is defined as the estimated amount of assistance for a period of enrollment that a student or a parent will receive from Federal, State, institutional, or other sources, such as, scholarships, grants, net earnings from need-based employment, or loans, including, but not limited to, any educational benefits paid because of enrollment in a postsecondary education institution, or to cover post-secondary education expenses. 34 C.F.R.  682.200(b).

employees (Student #56), 5% discount for alumni (Students #63, #67 and #75), and a military tuition discount (Student #39). UOP also frequently runs sales promotions where it waives various other fees, such as application fees (generally a $45 application fee).

UOP also has an Education Tuition Program for employees in good standing that provides a waiver for 100% of the tuition and certain other fees, as well as a waiver of 80% of the tuition for family members. These fee waivers are substantial, representing thousands of dollars per year. Student #73.

In each case, UOP posted the full charges to students' ledgers. The waiver or discount was then posted as a credit adjustment to ledgers. When packaging Title IV aid, UOP did not adjust the EFA to take these various fee waivers and discounts into account.
UOP personnel explained that under its procedures, the amount of fees and tuition used to determine COA is arrived at by using the amount of the average fees and tuition of all students. UOP Officials stated that it is UOP's procedure to exclude tuition and fee waivers and discounts that UOP grants when it determines EFA when packaging Title IV aid. UOP personnel further stated that given the high cost of UOP tuition, it is unlikely that UOP would overaward any Title IV aid.
Out of 90 students in the statistical samples, the ledgers of 52 students reflected discounts and waivers of varying amounts. Twenty-five files reflected only de minimus waivers of the $45 application fee. The files of some of the following 27 students, however, evidenced substantial amounts, from as low as $65 to as much as $13,990 per academic year.

None of the above files contained documentation showing that the discounts or waivers were included in the determination of need. While UOP personnel contended that disregarding such fee waivers and discounts would rarely result in a Title IV overaward, the reality is that this UOP practice result in overawards.

UOP personnel stated that they had never included the above discounts and waivers in the EFA when calculating need. UOP discovered this error in an internal audit that reviewed the need calculations for 100 randomly chosen files. Out of these 100 files, it found that 62 included fee waivers with potential overawards. Out of these 62 files, UOP found that five students received Title IV overawards totaling $17,000. Due to this discovery, UOP has undertaken the review of the files of all students receiving employee tuition waivers during the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 award years.
In response to this Program Review Report, UOP must continue its file review of all students who received employee tuition benefits during the 2007-08 and 2008-09 award years. UOP must recalculate the EFA and need of each of these students, and determine whether an overaward occurred and the extent of any overaward. It must then prepare a report of its review and submit the same in its response to this Program Review Report. Such report must be prepared in Excel format and contain the following fields, presented by award year:

In addition to the file review as described above, UOP must establish and implement policies and procedures that will assure that any adjustment to tuition and/or fees, including, but not limited to, "promotional" adjustments, "discounts," "waivers," or other credit adjustments known or contracted for at the time of a student's enrollment, are included in the EFA when calculating need for any Title IV recipient. A copy of such policies and procedures must be provided with the response to this Program Review Report.
Finding 3. Failure to Verify Data that UOP Had Reason to Believe was Incorrect or Failing to Complete Verification of Files Marked for Verification.
Institutions must require Title IV applicants to verify information used to calculate an applicant's Federal Pell EFC in two events:
Citation:
34 C.F.R.  668.54(a).
Information is verified by securing additional documentation or, in some cases, a signed statement attesting to the accuracy of the information provided. An institution is required to verify with documentation the income, household size and number in college. Copies of tax returns, signed by the student and parent for dependent students, must be obtained and reviewed to accurately verify the adjusted gross income, tax payments, tax filing status, and
 
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 33
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 19
untaxed items such as earned income credit as shown on the student's Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR). 34 C.F.R.  668.57.
Where verification is required because the institution has reason to believe that information is inaccurate, the institution must require an applicant to verify the information that the institution has reason to believe is inaccurate. 34 C.F.R.  668.54(a)(3). An institution possesses the requisite degree of administrative capability necessary to participate in the Title IV programs only if it maintains a system to discover such inaccuracies and inconsistencies. 34 C.F.R.  668.16.
Until all required items are verified and such verification is documented, students with inaccurate or inconsistent information pertaining to the EFC calculation must be considered ineligible. If an institution fails to obtain the necessary verification and resolve all inconsistent information, the student will remain ineligible. While the institution may make one Pell Grant disbursement for the first payment period, it may not disburse FFEL or DL proceeds until verification is complete. 34 C.F.R.  668.58. If unable to complete verification prior to the time that the student ceases enrollment, any Pell Grant disbursed must be returned to the institution's Pell Grant Program account. 34 C.F.R.  668.60.
In the statistical sample of 45 files for the 2007-2008 award year, two filesrevealed verification errors (4.4% error rate). The specific errors were as follows:
Noncompliance:

13
Only one day earlier, the 2007-08 ISIR for the student was processed indicating the following information:
 
 
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 34
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 20
The information reported on both ISIRs was suspect. As to 2006-07, UOP should have questioned how someone with over $22,000 in income, having no exemptions, would have had no earned income and paid no taxes. If, however, the student's actual 2005 AGI was $22,643, she and/or her spouse had earned income of $22,643 and had three exemptions (student, spouse and child), the student's EFC would have been 0 and the Pell disbursed should have been $2,025, not $1,550.
As to the 2007-08 ISIR, UOP again did not question what appears to be an obvious error: the student's earned income was equal to the spouse's, exactly, yet the AGI was also the exact same amount: $22,643, which was also reported as the AGI for the prior calendar year.
UOP disbursed net2006-07 Pell of $903. It also disbursed FFEL, but returned all FFEL funds after the student's withdrawal.

University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 21
As to Student #77, UOP must resolve the inconsistent information pertaining to the student's 2005 income and determine the correct EFC of the student. It must then calculate the correct 2006-07 Pell Grant disbursement, recalculate the amount of Title IV funds which the student earned and adjust the student's account accordingly.
Required Action:
As to Student #84, UOP must seek to resolve the inconsistent information and to complete the required verification for the 2006-07 and 2007-08 award years. It is to recalculate the EFCs accordingly if it resolves the inconsistent information. If UOP is unable to properly complete verification, it will be required to return all Title IV funds to the Department and the lender, together with any imputed and accrued interest.
Finding 4. Use of Title IV for Non-Program Purposes
An institution may use Title IV funds to credit a student's account to satisfy:
Citation:
34 C.F.R.  668.164(d).
In 16 out of the 90 files reviewed, UOP used Title IV funds to satisfy charges that were not tuition, fees, room or board, and were not educationally related. Such fees include application fees, fees charged of every applicant, regardless of whether enrolled, transcript fees, and late fees, as follows:

In its most recently completed compliance audit, the auditors found the use of Title IV funds to pay transcript, application, and diploma fees from September 1, 2005 through December 31, 2008, totaling $1,102,865. The auditor noted that such fees were nominal on a student by student basis.

If required to return these nominal amounts, students would then be billed and required to pay the sums to UOP.
UOP must establish and implement procedures and billing practices to assure that Title IV funds are not credited to any charges that are not educationally related. A copy of such procedures and a description of the practice must be provided in UOP's response to this Program Review Report.

Finding 5. Failure to Monitor Institutional Attendance Policy.
In order to continue to participate in any Title IV program, an institution must demonstrate that it is capable of adequately administering the program under each of the standards established in 34 C.F.R.  668.16. Institutions must establish and maintain the administrative and fiscal procedures and records necessary to ensure proper and efficient administration of Title IV funds. 34 C.F.R.  668.14(a)(4).

UOP's "Standard Office Procedure  Official Withdrawal" document provides:
The official withdrawal process needs to be completed for any financial aid student (past or present) taking a break of attendance greater than 29 days (21 days for students attending a Georgia campus) without a Leave of Absence or who is completely withdrawing from the University. The Official Withdrawal Form needs to be completed and processed in order to properly reconcile the student's account and meet the Department of Education's Title IV guidelines.
A student who has received financial aid through University of Phoenix at any time notifies his or her counselor that s/he is requesting to officially withdraw or take a break greater than 29 days (or 21 days for students attending Georgia campus).
This document then requires enrollment, academic, and finance counselors to make efforts to retain a student. If the enrollment, academic and finance counselors have exhausted their retention efforts, the finance counselor must review the student's file to determine if a LOA is appropriate. The finance counselor must then process the Official Withdrawal Form (or LOA Form if applicable).
Out of the total sample of 90 files, 49 Title IV recipients withdrew. For 45 of the 49 withdrawn Title IV recipients, UOP did not determine the students' withdrawal dates within 30 days of the students' last date of class attendance. Most of these students were absent 34-35 days before UOP determined that the student had withdrawn. These 45 students are identified on Appendix D, attached hereto.
UOP must establish and implement procedures that will assure that it follows its written procedures. In response to this Program Review Report, please provide a copy of the new policies and procedures that address attendance and Title IV procedures for students who withdraw. Please also address any corrective action taken to assure that UOP follows its written attendance withdrawal procedures.

Finding 6. Enrollment Status Not Verified Before Disbursement
An otherwise eligible student becomes ineligible to receive Title IV funds on the date that the student is no longer enrolled. 34 C.F.R.  668.164(g)(1).

Citation:
The student files revealed that a student who notifies UOP that he or she is withdrawing is treated as an enrolled student until the student fails to attend at least 30 days. For 22 students who notified UOP that they were withdrawing, UOP disregarded the withdrawal notice provided by the students and did not acknowledge the withdrawal until after several weeks of absence. Appendix D identifies those students who provided notice and the incorrectly documented "date of determination" used by UOP when it calculated R2T4.

Introduction
The University of Phoenix is pleased to provide this response to the Department's program review report dated December 28, 2009. The University has worked cooperatively with the Department's program reviewers throughout the process, and we look forward to continued cooperation and coordination as we move towards resolution of the review.
The University notes that the program review results to date, as reflected by the December report, are indicative of the University's overall compliance in its administration of the Federal Student Aid programs. We believe that the report, by its relatively limited findings, demonstrates the strength of our system of controls and administrative capability.
In this regard, we believe it is noteworthy that the program review results, as set forth in the report, indicate the following:
We welcome the Department's program review process as a means to achieve final resolution of self-reported items. While we are pleased that the results of the program review are indicative of our overall compliance, the University is fully committed to identifying, addressing, correcting, and preventing any instances of noncompliance, and we believe the program review process is an important mechanism for facilitating both enhanced and continued compliance.

Finding 1: Return to Title IV (R2T4) Funds Made Late
Finding 1 relates to the identification of student intent to withdraw from the University. As noted in the program review, the date of determination recorded by the University was different in some cases than the date determined by the Department based on the content of notes documented by University personnel that might indicate a student's intent to withdraw. In some instances, we believe it is unclear whether the student intended to withdraw from a course or the University. While the appropriate amount of funds were returned (the Department found no issues with our calculations of the amounts returned to the lender), the date of determination used by the Department resulted in some late returns, averaging no more than six days outside the required timeframe in the affected sample files.
Required Actions:
Response:
Due to the error rate noted in the sample (29%) for the 2008-2009 award year, the University is required to reimburse the Department for the estimated cost of Title IV funds paid untimely for that year. Three options for resolution were identified in the report. The University selects option 1, which determines the liability based on projecting the results of the program review sample to the total return of funds population for the 2008-2009 award year. As such, a copy of the check issued in the amount of $659,296.44 (as calculated by the Department using a cost of funds worksheet) is attached (see Exhibit A).
While the University offered multiple methods for students to process withdrawals and had a mechanism in place to identify withdrawals, the Department identified opportunities to tighten existing processes for those students not clearly identified as official withdrawals. The University has addressed the concerns noted in the report by updating the applicable policies and procedures and related consumer information, implementing new technology including student self-service withdrawals, and conducting additional training for campus advisors and University staff.
 
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 49
Policy
The University policy in effect at the time of the review did address date of determination. However, the University has revised the Official & Unofficial Withdrawals Policy (Exhibit B) to more clearly define the date of determination and withdrawal date for students who officially and unofficially withdraw from the University. Furthermore, the policy defines three designated offices where the student can officially withdraw from the University.
Procedure
The University has updated its procedures to ensure clear and timely identification of student intent to withdraw from the University in the Standard Operating Procedure for the Official Withdrawal Process (Exhibit C). The procedures reinforce the policy established above and include two newly implemented processes, which initiate a student-driven electronic workflow to systemically capture the institution's date of determination with respect to a student withdrawal.
Students who officially withdraw by contacting any of the designated offices directly are considered to have officially notified the University of their intent to withdraw on the date of such contact. The designated offices have been provided with procedures surrounding an automated process to initiate the Return of Title IV steps by entering a standardized comment into the student service notes and counselor task management system. The standard comments initiate an electronic workflow and record the date of determination. The advisors provide standard information to each student on the potential impact of withdrawing including, the fact that an account analysis will be performed to determine balances due, adjustments in Title IV funding (if applicable), and a reminder that any monies owed to a lender must be paid. In addition, the advisors inform students of the available alternatives to withdrawing, the possible financial impacts that may result from withdrawing from the University and the Return of Title IV process. This counseling does not impede the electronic withdrawal process, but is instead aimed at ensuring that students are fully informed concerning options available to them and of the administrative and financial impacts from withdrawing. If the student decides to return to the University within 29 days, the student must submit an electronic withdrawal rescission, and the student's return is monitored to ensure attendance is posted. Further, the University has a secondary control to capture unofficial withdrawals by monitoring attendance. This process has been strengthened by shortening the processing time.
 
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 50
An electronic self-service tool (available on eCampus, see Exhibit D) was implemented to allow students the option to officially withdraw from the University without involvement from University personnel. The date of determination is recorded as the date the student completes the electronic form. In addition, consumer disclosures and related acknowledgements are included in the online environment. The University advisors also initiate student contact within three business days to discuss the impacts of withdrawal and future actions. The student also has the ability to contact an advisor at any time during the withdrawal process for questions. As noted above, the counseling does not impede the electronic withdrawal process. If the student decides to return to the University, the student must submit an electronic withdrawal rescission as mentioned above.
The University has also clarified its previously established procedures to assure that students who request withdrawal are readily provided an explanation of the requirements and procedures for officially withdrawing. Such information is provided in consumer information (Exhibit E) and available on eCampus. Through the eCampus withdrawal process, a student is presented a series of acknowledgements and disclosures to ensure appropriate advising.
Additional training has been provided to help ensure staff understand the revised official withdrawal procedures and their role in the withdrawal process. This training included Enrollment Advisors, Academic Advisors, Finance Advisors, University Services staff, Financial Aid staff and Faculty. Training updates continue to be delivered as needed. Polices, procedures and training tools are available on-line for future reference.
As referenced in the program review report, the University did take action to resolve the concerns presented by the Department at the March 2008 meeting and provided supporting documentation. However, the University has further refined the related polices and automated procedures as described above to ensure consistent practices throughout the organization. We believe these enhancements fully address the concerns expressed. We will continue to assess and improve University practices to ensure compliance and a student-centered environment.
Conclusion:
We believe the University has fully addressed Finding 1. The University has revised policies and procedures to better inform students and improve compliance and consistency to provide for a student controlled service. Newly developed processes have been implemented to enhance systems to facilitate electronic processing and tracking of required actions for official withdrawals.

Finding 2: Financial Need Incorrectly Determined
Finding 2 indicates that discounts and waivers were not properly considered in all instances when calculating awards, which could result in an over award. The majority of the waivers and discounts noted in the sample were de minimus, with a few instances of larger dollar amounts. The most significant exception noted relates to an Apollo employee tuition assistance waiver. As indicated in the report, the employee tuition assistance matter was self-reported by the University in the 2008 compliance audit prior to the program review.
Required Actions:
Response:
The University has an established process that elicits from the student, on the required financial aid application, pertinent information about scholarships, grants, waivers, employee tuition assistance, discounts and other financial resources that support their education. These self-reported benefits are evaluated as EFA when the student's financial aid awards are calculated. Therefore, a process exists to include reported amounts in the calculation of the award.
The report mentioned that the majority of fee waivers are de minimus in nature. Additionally, for more substantial amounts including discounts, the Cost of Attendance (including tuition, fees and living expenses as defined and mandated by law) at the institution will usually exceed such amounts even when tuition is covered in full by another source. We reviewed each of the student files listed in the finding and none of the students were over awarded.
The more significant amounts relate to the employee tuition assistance benefits. In conjunction with its ongoing assessment of controls and as part of its continuous improvement efforts, the University determined that the Apollo employee tuition assistance was not consistently included in EFA. The University self-reported this matter in the 2008 compliance audit. Once identified, policies, procedures and controls surrounding this process were evaluated and revised appropriately. Additionally, the University evaluated each student who received Apollo tuition benefits to confirm that the tuition benefit was included in the evaluation of the student's unmet need. Where these benefits were originally omitted, the University recalculated the award, corrected it where necessary and
 
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 52
returned the funds to the Title IV source. The results of these corrections are included in the discussion below.
On September 30, 2009, communication was received from the Department of Education in the form of a Final Audit Determination Letter (FADL) for the 2008 compliance audit regarding incorrectly calculated Title IV awards for other resources not included in EFA. Per the FADL, "it appears that UOP has taken the necessary corrective action to address this finding." That corrective action included a review of awards for students receiving Apollo employee tuition benefit, as well as Title IV funds in the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 award years to determine the total over award amount due to the omission of employee tuition benefits in EFA. A total of 221 students with over awards were reported, resulting in a total of $460,771 for the 2007-2008 award year. For the 2008-2009 award year, a total of 97 students with over awards were reported, resulting in an over award amount of $279,334. The over awarded funds were returned to the appropriate source and the student accounts were adjusted to minimize the impact to the student.
While the FADL acknowledged the corrective actions taken to resolve the finding, it also indicated that further direction would be provided in the program review report. As such, the report required the results of the analysis to be evaluated by an Independent Public Accountant (IPA). The University engaged an IPA to complete the review. The review procedures were developed by the IPA and submitted to the Department within 30 days of receipt of the report. The Department approved the procedures as written. In preparation for this review, additional files were discovered in our original 2007-2008 population that required further analysis. Additionally, minor adjustments were made to the 2008-2009 results. The file review was completed and a comprehensive results file was compiled. The IPA completed the agreed upon procedures for both years as required. The revised results for 2007-2008 totaled 441 students with over awards, resulting in $855,256 being returned to the source. The results for 2008-2009 totaled 98 students, resulting in $291,095 being returned to the source. The IPA confirmed these results (see Electronic Media Exhibit A for detailed report in the format required by the Department) and prepared a report in accordance with the AICPA Attestation Standards (see Exhibit F). The University further addressed the concern by revising related policies and procedures as identified below.
Policy
The University policy in effect at the time of the review did address other sources of funding as reported by students in the application process. However, the University has revised the Packaging Policy (Exhibit G) to more clearly define estimated financial assistance in determining need.
Procedure
The University has implemented procedures to consistently capture employee tuition assistance for inclusion in the award process. Students who are eligible for Apollo tuition assistance are identified weekly by a report generated from the student accounting system that identifies employees, spouses, and dependents. That file is compared to the financial aid system to determine if any students reported are a Title IV applicant. An electronic
 
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 53
comparison is then performed to verify benefits have been self reported and properly included in the award process. If not, the award is revised accordingly.
This process is repeated weekly and includes a cumulative list of all affected students to ensure the evaluation of the student file had been properly completed.
In continuing to improve current procedures, the application information related to self-reporting is being further enhanced to ensure the questions are more clearly stated. Additional guidance is being included to ensure students understand what should be reported as other financial assistance. Employee tutorials that are required for those students receiving employee benefits are being enhanced to provide additional guidance to ensure this information is properly reported when completing the financial aid application.
The University is developing a systematic solution as an enhancement to existing systems as a means to identify other benefits a student receives to pay tuition and fees, such as support from other employers, tuition discounts and waivers. The automated solution will identify the amount of any benefit paid directly to the student's account, evaluate if the student previously reported the benefit and support an analysis of whether the benefit on the student account would cause the student to have resources greater than the student's financial need or cost of attendance. When implemented, the automated solution will add additional controls at the point financial aid is awarded and at the time of disbursement in a loan period/academic year to identify changes between those events.
Conclusion:
We believe the University has fully addressed Finding 2. The University evaluated each student who received Apollo tuition benefits as identified above to confirm that the tuition benefit was included in the evaluation of the student's unmet need. Any required adjustments to a disbursed award were processed and returned to the source while minimizing the adverse impact to the affected students. The results of this review were subject to external examination by an IPA and a report was prepared indicating the results were complete and accurate. In addition, the University has revised policies and procedures to better ensure compliance and consistency in capturing and including employee tuition assistance in awards. Finally, the University is developing a systematic solution that will further automate this process to capture the various forms of estimated financial assistance for consideration in the award and disbursement processes.

Finding 3: Failure to Verify Data that UOP Had Reason to Believe was Incorrect or Failing to Complete Verification of Files Marked for Verification
Finding 3 relates to resolution of inconsistent information in two student files that may have an impact on the student award. The report also noted that for one of these students, inconsistent information was not resolved during the verification process.
Required Action:
Response:
While verification policies and procedures have been appropriately established and are in compliance with the requirements, components of the process are manual in nature. As a result, two discrepancies were noted in the file review. The files were reviewed by the University as required. The results are as follows:
 
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 55
 
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 56
Based on the results above, in one instance inconsistent information was not properly resolved and the funds have been returned to the appropriate source. In addition the Department has completed a cost of funds calculation on the funds (see Exhibit L), resulting in $1,530.03 to be remitted to the Department (see Exhibit M for copy of check). The student accounts have been properly adjusted, resulting in no adverse impact to the student.
To ensure further compliance, training was conducted that reiterated policies and procedures. This training will continue to occur as required.
Conclusion:
We believe the University has fully addressed Finding 3. The University reviewed the two student exceptions as required. We agree with the finding for student 84 for the 2006-2007 award year and have returned the funds. The exception was caused by an error in the manual process. We do not believe there was a requirement to follow-up on student 77 for the 2006-2007 award. In addition, the student was not a Title IV recipient for the 2007-2008 award year.
 
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 57
Finding 4: Use of Title IV for Non-Program Purposes
Finding 4 identifies instances of Title IV funds used to satisfy certain nominal charges that were not educationally related. As noted in the program review report, the application of funds to ineligible fees matter was self-reported by the University and included in the 2008 compliance audit prior to the program review. In conjunction with this self-reported item, an analysis of the funds applied to the student accounts and related system controls was completed and corrective action was implemented.
Required Actions:
Response:
In conjunction with its ongoing assessment of controls and as part of its continuous improvement efforts, the University discovered that in some instances Title IV funds were applied to ineligible fees. Once identified, policies, procedures and controls surrounding this process were evaluated and revised appropriately. The University implemented systematic controls and more stringent monitoring controls. The exceptions noted in the program review occurred prior to the implementation of these improved controls.
On September 30, 2009, communication was received from the Department of Education in the form of a FADL regarding application of Title IV funds to ineligible fees. Per the FADL, " it appears that UOP has taken the necessary corrective action to address this finding." While the FADL acknowledged the corrective actions taken to resolve the finding, it also indicated that further direction would be provided in the program review report. As such, the program review report requires the submission of current policies and procedures on the matter.
Policy
The University Allowable Charges policy (Exhibit N) has been updated to more clearly define allowable charges.
Procedure
As described above, system controls now prevent application of funds to ineligible fees. To ensure exceptions do not occur, a monthly monitoring control was also established. Corporate Accounting runs and monitors an exception report to ensure funds were properly applied. In addition, a second review is conducted on a quarterly basis.
 
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 58
Conclusion:
We believe the University has fully addressed Finding 4. The University conducted a complete analysis of the funds applied upon discovery of the issue. Policies, procedures and controls surrounding this process were evaluated and revised appropriately. The University implemented system enhancements to provide more stringent controls to ensure compliance.
 
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 59
Finding 5: Failing to Monitor Institutional Attendance Policy
Finding 5 relates to the incorrect date of determination of a student's unofficial withdrawal. As noted in the program review, the University's written policy states that the University will determine the unofficial withdrawal date within 30 days of the student's last date of class attendance. In the files reviewed, there were instances noted of a withdrawal date not determined until 34-35 days.
Required Actions:
Response:
The University's written policy states that the University will determine the withdrawal date within 30 days of the student's last date of class attendance. In order to make this determination, the University runs a weekly "Exit Report" to capture students who had a break in attendance of greater than 29 days. The " Exit Report" is run only on weekends to balance system capacity. As a result, the report date, which is used as the date of determination, can be up to 10 days beyond 29 days of their last date of attendance. While the withdrawal date in some instances was not determined within 30 days of the student's last date of class attendance as stated in the prior policy, there were no late or incorrectly calculated return of Title IV funds identified in this finding.
Policy
While no procedural changes were required, the University has revised the Official & Unofficial Withdrawals Policy (Exhibit A) to more clearly and accurately describe the processes. That revised policy indicates that the University will determine the withdrawal date for students who unofficially withdraw no greater than 10 days after the 29day the student was in class attendance. We appreciate the Department's review and the suggested changes to the proposed policy and concurrence that procedures do not need to be submitted in response to this review.
th
Conclusion:
We believe the University has fully addressed Finding 5. The University has revised its policy specifying the date of determination for unofficial withdrawals to ensure continued compliance with University policy.
 
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 60
Finding 6: Enrollment Status Not Verified Before Disbursement
Finding 6 relates to the disbursement of Title IV funds for students who officially notified the University of their intent to withdraw. As noted in the program review report, the date of determination recorded by the University was different in some cases than the date determined by the Department based on the content of notes documented by University personnel that might indicate a student's intent to withdraw. In some instances we believe it is unclear whether the student intended to withdraw from a course or the University. The Department's interpretation of the notes documented by University personnel is that the student intended to withdraw from the University resulting in disbursing funds to a student who is no longer enrolled.
Required Actions:
Response:
While the University has taken actions to implement the enhancements as outlined below, automated disbursement controls already existed. These controls confirm, at the point of disbursement, that the student is meeting eligibility criteria in that payment period for the applicable award year. That criteria includes confirming admission status, Satisfactory Academic Progress, and that the student is enrolled and has attended the first course of the schedule. If the student does not meet the criteria in the automated process, the disbursement record is pended until all criteria are met.
We believe that the cases cited in this finding in the program review do not speak to weakness in this control environment that verifies enrollment before disbursement. Rather, the cases relate to Finding 1 regarding accurate recording of the date of determination for students who intend to withdraw. Had the student intent to withdraw been processed in a timely manner, the controls mentioned above would have prevented disbursement of funds.
The University has tightened controls surrounding date of determination when a student notifies the designated office of intent to withdraw (see response to finding 1).
As stated in a communication on July 14, 2009, the University implemented enhanced disbursement controls to ensure eligible students receive Title IV funds. With these controls, the student is considered to be enrolled, in accordance with University policies. The disbursements are not cancelled, but placed on hold until the student meets the following criteria.
 
University of Phoenix OPE ID 02098800 PRCN 200920926841 Page 61
Conclusion:
As detailed above, controls existed to confirm appropriate enrollment status at the time funds are requested from the lender, and again when funds are disbursed to the student. Additional controls have been implemented to further enhance disbursement releases. The cases cited in the program review report represent exceptions surrounding date of determination when a student notified the designated office of intent to withdraw. Had the student intent to withdraw been processed in a timely manner, the controls mentioned above would have prevented disbursement of funds.
We believe the University has fully addressed the issues related to acknowledging student intent to withdraw as outlined in the response to finding 1. The University has revised policies and procedures to better ensure compliance and consistency. Newly developed processes have been implemented to enhance systems to facilitate electronic official withdrawal processing, recording of the date of determination and tracking of required actions for official withdrawals within 45 days of the date of determination. These official withdrawal enhancements combined with existing and additional disbursement controls identified above address the concerns cited.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
     On June 23, 2010, Apollo Group, Inc. issued a press release announcing the reversal by the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals of the ruling of the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona in which the District Court vacated the January 2008 jury verdict in favor of the plaintiffs in Apollo's securities class action lawsuit, captioned . A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
In re Apollo Group, Inc. Securities Litigation
     The information in Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K and Exhibit 99.1 furnished herewith shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that section, nor shall they be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(d) Exhibits.
The following exhibits are provided herewith:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
PHOENIX, June 23, 2010  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOL) today announced that the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has reversed a lower court's ruling in favor of the Company and ordered the lower court to enter judgement against the Company in accordance with the jury verdict in securities litigation arising out of a 2003 program review by the U.S. Department of Education, .
Apollo Group Inc. Securities Litigation
"The Company is disappointed in the Ninth Circuit's decision, and believes that the lower court's well-reasoned decision in its favor was correct," said P. Robert Moya, senior vice president, general counsel and secretary for Apollo Group, Inc. "We will explore all available options for seeking further review of the Ninth Circuit's decision."
Appellate Argument Overview
Under securities law, to prevail at trial, the plaintiff had to prove that a "corrective disclosure"  a disclosure that reveals to the market the falsity of prior statements or omissions  caused the price of Apollo's stock to decline and, consequently, caused the losses of the plaintiff class.
When the contents of the initial government report at issue were reported by major business publications including , Apollo's stock price did not decline by a statistically significant amount. Consequently, the plaintiff pointed to a downgrade by a single market analyst one week later  a downgrade that made no mention of the report's contents and contained no new facts  and argued that it caused a decline in the price of Apollo stock for which the plaintiff class of shareholders should be compensated.
The Wall Street Journal
Although the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, Apollo argued, and the district court agreed, that the analyst report contained nothing new about the initial government report or its effects. The information that the plaintiff argued was newly disclosed by the analyst report was either clearly disclosed in previous news reports, or was not accurate. The district court recognized that neither false information nor previously disclosed information can correct anything. Accordingly, the district court ruled that the jury's apparent finding that the downgrade was a corrective disclosure was not supported by any evidence, and therefore failed as a matter of law.
Litigation Background
This case, Apollo Group Inc. Securities Litigation, was a consolidated securities class action brought by the Policemen's Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago. It stemmed from allegations about the non-disclosure of an initial government report involving the manner in which Apollo subsidiary University of Phoenix compensated its enrollment counselors. The report's
1
 
allegations, which were first raised in a False Claims Act lawsuit filed in 2003 by two private plaintiffs and then repeated with striking similarity in the initial government report at issue, have been largely discredited in recent years. The False Claims Act case was recently resolved, importantly with no admission of liability, wrongdoing, noncompliance or violation.
Apollo Group Inc. Securities Litigation was tried in Federal District Court in Arizona beginning November 14, 2007. The jury found in favor of the plaintiff on January 16, 2008 and the plaintiff class was awarded damages of up to $5.55 per share. On February 13, 2008, Apollo filed post-trial motions in which it asked the trial court to: (1) reverse the erroneous verdict; (2) order a new trial; or (3) condition denial of Apollo's motions on the plaintiff's acceptance of a reduced amount of damages not to exceed $3.49 per share. On August 4, 2008, the trial court overturned the erroneous jury verdict and resolved the case in favor of Apollo, finding that an analyst report on which the plaintiff's case heavily relied was not a corrective disclosure.

Exhibit 99.1
Phoenix, Arizona, June 30, 2010  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or the "Company") today reported financial results for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2010.
"We are pleased to have made significant progress on our strategic initiatives designed to enhance the student experience, expand student protections and ensure we enroll students who we believe can succeed in our programs," said Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer and Apollo Global Chairman Greg Cappelli. "This quarter's results reflect continued success with our efforts to shift the mix of our enrollments towards bachelor level students. Additionally, based on the favorable results we've seen from our University Orientation pilot, we have decided to roll out the program more broadly this fall. We are confident that this is the right thing to do for our students, and believe it will allow us to deliver sustainable, high quality results over the long term."
Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer Chas Edelstein added, "We are committed to strengthening and capitalizing on Apollo Group's position as a leading provider of high quality, accessible education for individuals around the world, and for us that means putting the student first. We are focused on delivering quality academic programs that are relevant to today's working learners and providing them with high levels of service and support from their first day in class through graduationall of which should maximize the value of our students' return on their educational investment."
Unaudited Third Quarter of Fiscal 2010 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the three months ended May 31, 2010, totaled $1,337.4 million, which represents a 27.7% increase over the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Contributing to the growth in the third quarter was a 13.3% year-over-year increase in University of Phoenix total Degreed Enrollment to 476,500, as well as $75.8 million in net revenue from BPP Holdings, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended May 31, 2010, of $177.2 million, or $1.16 per share (152.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $206.4 million, or $1.30 per share (159.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended May 31, 2009.
The third quarter of fiscal 2010 results contain a goodwill impairment charge of $8.7 million ($7.5 million net of the portion attributable to noncontrolling interest) for the Universidad Latinoamericana ("ULA") subsidiary of Apollo Global (the Company did not record an associated tax benefit because the goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes), as well as a pre-
1
 
tax charge of $132.6 million ($79.9 million net of tax) representing an accrual related to a securities class action lawsuit. Excluding these special items, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended May 31, 2010, was $264.6 million, or $1.74 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $206.4 million, or $1.30 per share for the three months ended May 31, 2009. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
In the third quarter of fiscal 2010, BPP's operations contributed $75.8 million to net revenue and increased earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group by approximately $0.05. (See the supplemental schedule detailing BPP's financial results in the tables section of this press release.)
Instructional costs and services increased by $150.0 million, or 38.4% to $540.6 million for the three months ended May 31, 2010, compared to the three months ended May 31, 2009. As a percentage of revenue, instructional costs and services increased 310 basis points to 40.4% versus 37.3% in the prior year's third quarter. The increase, as a percentage of revenue, was primarily due to the addition of BPP, as its cost structure is more heavily weighted towards instructional costs and services, as well as higher bad debt expense for University of Phoenix. Bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenue, increased 200 basis points to 5.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 versus 3.4% in the prior year's third quarter. BPP's operations favorably impacted overall bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue by 30 basis points in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. The higher bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenue, is due to lower collection rates. Collection rates have declined as a result of the economic downturn and increases in receivables from students enrolled in associate's degree programs. Students in associate's degree programs generally persist at lower rates than those in higher degree level programs, resulting in higher bad debt expense.
Selling and promotional expenses increased by $32.2 million, or 13.3%, to $273.5 million for the three months ended May 31, 2010, compared to the three months ended May 31, 2009. The increase was due in part to greater investments in the University of Phoenix's non-internet long-term branding and program-driven initiatives. As a percentage of revenue, selling and promotional expenses declined 260 basis points to 20.4% versus 23.0% in the prior year's third quarter. The decrease, as a percentage of revenue, was driven by the impact of BPP's operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 as BPP incurs lower selling and promotional costs as a percentage of revenue compared to the Company's other businesses. The remaining decrease as a percentage of revenue was a result of continued improvement in enrollment counselor effectiveness and lower advertising expenditures at University of Phoenix.
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses increased by $8.8 million, or 12.4%, to $79.7 million, for the three months ended May 31, 2010, compared to the three months ended May 31, 2009. As a percentage of revenue, G&A expenses declined 80 basis points to 6.0% versus 6.8% in the prior year's third quarter. The decrease, as a percentage of revenue, is primarily attributable to lower legal costs and lower share-based compensation expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 as compared with the prior year period. BPP's operations had little impact on G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2010.

Financial and Operating Metrics
Below are Apollo Group's unaudited financial data and operating metrics for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 versus the prior year period.
 
Unaudited Nine Months of Fiscal 2010 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the nine months ended May 31, 2010, was $3.7 billion, a 27.3% increase over the comparable period of fiscal 2009. Contributing to this increase was a 15.6%
3
 
increase in University of Phoenix's average Degreed Enrollment during the nine months ended May 31, 2010, as compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2009. The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $520.9 million, or $3.37 per share, (154.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the nine months ended May 31, 2010, compared to $517.5 million, or $3.22 per share, (161.0 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the nine months ended May 31, 2009.
Results for the nine months ended May 31, 2010, contain a goodwill impairment charge of $8.7 million ($7.5 million net of the portion attributable to noncontrolling interest) for the Universidad Latinoamericana ("ULA") subsidiary of Apollo Global (the Company did not record an associated tax benefit because the goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes), a pre-tax charge of $177.1 million ($106.8 million net of tax) representing an accrual related to a securities class action lawsuit, and a previously announced tax benefit of $11.4 million resulting from the settlement for disputed tax issues with the Internal Revenue Service. Excluding these special items, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the nine months ended May 31, 2010, was $623.8 million, or $4.04 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $517.5 million, or $3.22 per share for the nine months ended May 31, 2009. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
BPP's operations contributed $218.1 million to net revenue and increased earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group by approximately $0.02 for the nine months ended May 31, 2010. (See the supplemental schedule detailing BPP's financial results in the tables section of this press release.)
Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of May 31, 2010, the Company's cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $892.0 million as compared to $968.2 million as of August 31, 2009. The decrease is primarily attributable to repayments on the Company's outstanding debt and share repurchases, largely offset by cash generated from operations. Restricted cash increased by $49.9 million compared to August 31, 2009, primarily due to increased student deposits at University of Phoenix. Subsequent to May 31, 2010, the Company posted a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $126 million in connection with a program review of University of Phoenix by the U.S. Department of Education. The letter of credit is fully cash collateralized which reduces the Company's unrestricted cash and cash equivalent balance. In addition, the Company may be required to post a bond in association with a securities class action lawsuit.
At May 31, 2010, accounts receivable decreased to $249.2 million from $298.3 million at August 31, 2009. Excluding accounts receivable and the associated net revenue for Apollo Global, the Company's days sales outstanding ("DSO") was 30 days at May 31, 2010, compared to 32 days at August 31, 2009, and to 24 days at May 31, 2009. The increase in DSO versus a year ago is due to increases in gross accounts receivable as a result of lower collection rates at University of Phoenix and the effects of certain operational changes. Collection rates have declined as a result of the economic downturn and increases in receivables from students enrolled in associate's degree programs.
4
 
Total debt outstanding (including short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt) decreased by $422.5 million to $166.6 million at May 31, 2010, from $589.1 million at August 31, 2009. The decrease is primarily due to the repayment of US denominated borrowings on the Company's $500 million credit facility during the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
Share Repurchases
During the third quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $55.50 per share for a total expenditure of $139.3 million. As of May 31, 2010, approximately $660.7 million remained available under the Company's current share repurchase authorization. Subsequent to May 31, 2010, the Company repurchased an additional 2.0 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $49.76 per share for a total expenditure of approximately $100.0 million. Including these purchases, approximately $561 million remains available under the Company's current share repurchase authorization.
Business Outlook
The Company offers the following commentary regarding the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 based on current business trends, which could change:
In addition, the Company has been piloting its University Orientation program, which is a free three-week, non-credit bearing program for new students enrolling at University of Phoenix with fewer than 24 credit hours. The Company currently intends to require all incoming students with fewer than 24 credit hours to participate in the orientation program beginning during the latter half of the first quarter of fiscal 2011, which will adversely impact the Company's operating metrics and financial results. Based on current business trends, which could change, and the results of the initial pilot orientation program, the Company offers the following commentary regarding its preliminary outlook for the fiscal year 2011:

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
This press release and the related conference call contain non-GAAP financial measures, which are intended to supplement, but not substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Management uses, and chooses to disclose to investors, these non-GAAP financial measures because (i) such measures provide an additional analytical tool to clarify the Company's results from operations and help to identify underlying trends in its results of operations; (ii) as to the non-GAAP earnings measures, such measures help compare the Company's performance on a
6
 
consistent basis across time periods; and (iii) these non-GAAP measures are employed by the Company's management in its own evaluation of performance and are utilized in financial and operational decision-making processes, such as budgeting and forecasting. Exclusion of items in our non-GAAP presentation should not be construed as an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Other companies, including other companies in the education industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure across companies.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
     (e) Material Compensatory Plan, Contract or Arrangement.
     1. . On June 24, 2010, the Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors of Apollo Group, Inc. (the "Company") adopted and approved the Senior Executive Severance Pay Plan (the "Plan"), pursuant to which the Company's executive officers and other senior executives may become entitled to salary continuation payments and other severance benefits in the event their employment with the Company is terminated under certain defined circumstances.
Implementation of Senior Executive Severance Pay Plan
     The severance benefits to which the covered participants may become entitled upon such a termination of employment may be summarized as follows:
     (i) separation pay in the form of salary continuation payments ranging from nine (9) months for Grade Level 18 executives to twenty-four (24) months for Grade Level 22 executives;
     (ii) for executives in Grade Levels 20 or above, such separation pay will also include 100% of the average of their annual bonuses earned for the three (3) fiscal years preceding the fiscal year of their termination, and for Grade 19 Level executives, such separation pay will also include 50% of such average annual bonus;
     (iii) lump sum payment of COBRA health care coverage costs for executives at Grade Level 20 and above for a period coterminous with their salary continuation period;
     (iv) limited pro-rata vesting of equity awards made on or after the June 24, 2010 effective date of the plan to individuals who are at Grade Level 18 or above on the effective date of those awards; and
     (v) outplacement assistance for up to six (6) months.
     Each of the Company's executive officers named in the Company's Shareholders Information Statement dated December 30, 2010 and filed on Schedule 14C with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 29, 2009 (the "Named Executive Officers") is eligible to participate in the Plan. Their current Grade Levels are as follows:
     However, to the extent a covered individual is entitled to severance benefits under an employment agreement or other severance arrangement in effect with the Company at the time of his or her termination of employment, then his or her severance benefits under the Plan will be reduced by the severance benefits
 
payable under such employment agreement or other arrangement so that there will be no duplication of benefits. At present, Dr. Sperling and Messrs. Edelstein, Cappelli, D'Amico and Moya each have employment agreements with the Company that provide severance benefits in the event their employment is terminated under certain circumstances.
     The receipt of severance benefits under the Plan will be conditioned upon the executive's delivery of an effective and enforceable general release of all claims against the Company and its affiliates and his or her compliance with certain non-competition, non-solicitation and non-disparagement covenants to be set forth in the release agreement.
     A copy of the Plan is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
     2. . On June 24, 2010, the Compensation Committee also authorized performance share awards under the Company's 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the "2SIP"), to approximately forty (40) individuals, including three (3) of the Named Executive Officers. The awards will become effective at the close of business on the third business day following the Company's release of its earnings results for the quarter ended May 31, 2010 (the "Effective Date"). The number of performance shares to be awarded to each individual will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the performance share award authorized for him or her by the closing selling price of the Company's Class A common stock on the Effective Date. The dollar amount of the performance share award authorized for each of the Named Executive Officers receiving performance share awards is as follows:
Performance Share Awards
     Such dollar value represents fifteen percent (15%) of the total value of the equity award that the Compensation Committee authorized for each such Named Executive Officer on June 24, 2010. The remaining dollar value of each equity award is allocated equally to a stock option component covering shares of the Company's Class A common stock (valued at their Black/Scholes value) and a restricted stock unit award covering additional shares of Class A common stock with performance-vesting and service-vesting requirements. The actual number of shares subject to those equity awards will not be determined until the Effective Date.
     The performance-vesting requirement for the performance share awards is tied to the average of the annual growth rates in the Company's adjusted free cash flow for each of the three fiscal years of the Company comprising the performance period (the 2011, 2012 and 2013 fiscal years). In determining the average of those annual growth rates, the growth rate of adjusted free cash flow for the 2011 fiscal year will be determined by comparing the adjusted free cash flow for that year against the adjusted free cash flow for the 2010 fiscal year. The growth in adjusted free cash flow for each of the two (2) remaining fiscal years will be calculated in comparison to the adjusted free cash flow realized for the immediately preceding fiscal year. Once the growth rate for each of the three (3) fiscal years is calculated, the simple average of those three (3) annual growth rates will be determined, and that average (rounded up to the next whole one-tenth decimal point) will represent the actual level of performance attainment.
     The calculation of adjusted free cash flow for each relevant fiscal year will be based on cash flow from operations for that fiscal year, as determined on a consolidated basis with the Company's consolidated subsidiaries for financial reporting purposes and will be subject to certain pre-specified adjustments, reductions and exclusions authorized by the Compensation Committee. Within seventy-five (75) days after the completion of the performance period, the Compensation Committee will certify the actual level of attained performance. On the basis of that certified level of attainment, the number of performance shares authorized for each performance share recipient will be multiplied by the applicable percentage determined
 
in accordance with the schedule below to determine the maximum number of shares of the Company's Class A common stock issuable on the basis of the attained performance level.
     The actual number of shares of Class A common stock in which each performance share recipient will vest is to be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Class A common stock into which his or her performance shares are converted by reason of the attained performance level by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of fiscal years of employment such individual completes with the Company within the performance period and the denominator of which is three (3). Pursuant to his existing employment agreement with the Company, the performance shares awarded to Mr. D'Amico provide certain service-vesting credits in the event his employment with the Company should terminate under certain prescribed circumstances during the performance period.
     A copy of the standard form of Performance Share Award Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
     At a duly-scheduled meeting held on June 24, 2010, the holders of the Company's Class B common stock unanimously approved an amendment to the 2SIP that effected the following changes to the 2SIP:
     (i) introduced the free cash flow metric as a generic performance goal to which specific targets may be established by the Compensation Committee as a performance-vesting requirement for one or more awards made under the 2SIP, including performance share awards;
     (ii) specified the types of adjustments, reductions and exclusions that may be made in connection with the calculation of any performance goal tied to adjusted free cash flow or net income; and
 
     (iii) imposed more precise parameters upon the terms and conditions governing performance share awards authorized under the 2SIP.
     A copy of the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan Amendment is attached as Exhibit 10.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

On the date of the Participant's Involuntary Termination or within fifteen (15) days thereafter, the Company shall furnish such Participant with a letter which describes the benefits of the Plan as applicable to the Participant (the "Severance Letter"). With the Severance Letter the Company shall also forward the appropriate form of Release to be executed by the Participant.
If age 40 or older, the Participant shall have twenty-one (21) calendar days from the date the Participant is provided with the form Release to review, sign and return that Release to the Company. However, if the Severance Pay is provided under this Plan in connection with an event which the Company in its discretion determines is a program affecting a group or class of Eligible Employees within the meaning of 29 USC Section 626(f)(1)(F)(ii), the Participant shall have forty-five (45) calendar days from the date the Participant is provided with the form Release to review, sign and return that Release to the Company.

Provided the Participant returns, within the applicable time period provided under Article II, Section E, the Release required to receive benefits under the Plan and does not revoke that release, the Severance Pay will be paid in successive equal installments over a period of months equal to the total number of months taken into account in calculating the Base Pay component of the Severance Pay to which such Participant is entitled. Such installments shall be payable over the applicable period on the regularly scheduled pay dates in effect for the Company's salaried employees, with the first such installment to be paid on the first such pay date within the seventy-five (75)-day period measured from the date of the Participant's Separation from Service due to his or her Involuntary Termination on which the Release delivered by the Participant in accordance with Article II, Section E is effective following the expiration of the applicable maximum review/delivery/return and revocation periods to which the Participant is entitled under the Plan and any applicable law with respect to such Release, or to begin on such subsequent date thereafter as the Company may determine in its sole discretion, but in no event shall the first such installment be paid later than the last day of the seventy-five (75)-day period measured from the date of the Participant's Separation from Service. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the Severance Pay payable pursuant to this Section II F shall be deemed to be a series of separate payments, with each installment of the Severance Pay to be treated as a separate payment, and any such separate payments made during the period commencing with date of the Participant's Involuntary Termination and ending with March 15 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such Involuntary Termination occurs shall constitute the Participant's "Short-Term Deferral Payments" for purposes of Article III of the Plan.

G. In the event that the Participant violates any confidentiality, non-compete, non-solicitation or non-disparagement provisions in the Release or any other agreement between the Company and the Participant, the Participant shall not be entitled to Severance Pay, COBRA Coverage Costs, Pro-Rata Vesting of Equity Awards or Outplacement. If the Participant violates any Confidentiality, Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation or Non-Disparagement provisions in the Release or other agreement between the Company and the Participant, the Participant shall repay or return all Severance Pay, COBRA Coverage

Costs and the number of shares of the Company's common stock attributable to the Pro-Rata Vesting of Equity Awards (or the gain realized from the sale of such shares) paid or issued to the Participant, along with the value of any Outplacement provided to the Participant.
Except as provided in this Plan or to the extent required by law or the applicable provisions of an employee benefit program, coverage under all employee benefit programs maintained by Company will cease on the date of the Participant's termination of employment. The Participant shall, however, have such rights as are required by law or the applicable provision of an employee benefit program with respect to the Company's employee benefit programs, including the right to elect "COBRA" coverage under the Company health benefit programs.

Other Benefits
.
 
     A. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in Article II or any other Article of the Plan, other than Sections III B and III C below, no severance benefit payable under the Plan (or component thereof) that is deemed to constitute an item of "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and that is otherwise payable in connection with a Participant's Separation from Service shall be paid to the Participant until the earlier of (i) the first day of the seventh (7th) month following the date of such Participant's Separation from Service or (ii) the date of his or her death, if the Participant is deemed at the time of such Separation from Service to be a Specified Employee such delayed commencement is otherwise required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Code Section 409A(a)(2). Upon the expiration of the applicable delay period, all payments delayed pursuant to this Section III A, whether they were otherwise payable in installments or a lump sum, shall be paid in a lump sum to the Participant, and any remaining severance benefits shall be paid in accordance with the applicable provisions of Article II.
and
     B. Notwithstanding Section A of this Article III, the delayed commencement date provisions of such Section III A shall not be applicable to (i) any severance payments under Article II that qualify as Short-Term Deferral Payments exempt from Code Section 409A or any other severance benefits hereunder that qualify for such exemption and (ii) the portion of a Participant's Severance Pay, COBRA Coverage Costs and the Pro-Vesting of Equity Awards otherwise subject to Code Section 409A that does not exceed the dollar limit described below and that is otherwise scheduled to be paid in connection with such Participant's Separation from Service but not later than the last day of the second calendar year following the calendar year in which such Separation from Service occurs. Accordingly, the foregoing clause (i) and (ii) payments shall be paid to the Participant as they become due and payable in accordance with the payment provisions of Article II. For purposes of clause (ii) of this Section III B, the applicable dollar limitation will be equal to two (2) times the lesser of (A) the Participant's annualized compensation (based on his or her annual rate of pay for the taxable year preceding the taxable year of his or her Separation from Service, adjusted to reflect any increase during that taxable year which was expected to continue indefinitely had such Separation from Service not occurred) or (B) the compensation limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code as in effect in the year of the Separation from Service.
     C. Section A of this Article III shall not apply to the lump sum payment of COBRA Coverage Costs to the extent the dollar amount of that payment does not exceed the applicable dollar amount in effect under Section 402(g)(1)(B) of the Code for the calendar year in which the Participant's Separation form Service occurs.
 
     D. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, no distribution shall be made from the Plan that would constitute an impermissible acceleration of payment as defined in Section 409A(3) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.
     E. No interest shall be paid on any Severance Pay or COBRA Coverage Costs for which a delayed commencement date is required in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Article III.
 
     Except as provided by applicable law, no Severance Pay, COBRA Coverage Costs or Pro-Rata Vesting of Equity Awards payable to any Participant under the provisions of the Plan shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge, and any attempt so to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, or charge the same shall be void, nor shall any such Severance Pay, COBRA Coverage Costs or Pro-Rata Vesting of Equity Awards be in any manner liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements, or torts of any Participant.
     If any Participant is, in the judgment of the Administrator, unable to take care of his or her affairs for any reason whatsoever, including mental condition, illness or accident, any Severance Pay, COBRA Coverage Costs or Pro-Rata Vesting of Equity Awards payable under the Plan may be paid to the guardian or other legal representative of such Participant or to such other person or institution who, in the opinion of the Administrator, is then maintaining or has custody of such Participant. Such payment shall constitute a full discharge with respect thereto and the Administrator shall have sole discretion in determining to whom such payment shall be made and in changing the payee from time to time.
 
     The Plan shall be unfunded. All Severance Pay and COBRA Coverage Costs intended to be provided under the Plan shall be paid from time to time from the general assets of the Company and paid in accordance with the provisions of the Plan.
 
     The plan administrator shall establish a claims procedure which satisfies the requirements of 29 CFR Section 2560.503-1 as applicable to a severance pay plan subject to ERISA. The Plan Administrator has full and complete discretionary authority to decide any matter presented through the claims procedure and the final decision by the Plan Administrator shall be binding on all parties to the maximum extent allowed by law.
 
     The general administration of the Plan shall be vested in the Administrator who shall be the Plan Administrator for purposes of ERISA.
     The Administrator may employ counsel, actuaries and agents and engage such clerical, medical and actuarial services as the Administrator deems expedient.
     All expenses incurred by the Administrator in the administration of the Plan, including compensation of the counsel, agents and agencies as the Administrator may appoint or employ, shall be paid by the Company.
 
     The Administrator shall keep such accounts and records as it may deem necessary or proper in the performance of its duties as administrator of the Plan.
 
     The Administrator shall have full and complete discretionary power and authority to determine the amount of any Severance Pay, COBRA Coverage Costs and Pro-Rata Vesting of Equity Awards, if any, payable under the Plan and all other matters arising in the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan.
     The Plan is intended to comply with the applicable requirements of Code Section 409A and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Payments to Plan Participants are also intended, where possible, to comply with the "short term deferral exception" and the "involuntary separation pay exception" to Code Section 409A. Accordingly, the provisions of the Plan applicable to Severance Pay, COBRA Coverage Costs and Pro-Rata Vesting of Equity Awards and the determination of the Participant's Separation form Service due to his or her Involuntary Termination shall be applied, construed and administered so that those benefits qualify for one or both of those exceptions, to the maximum extent allowable. However, to the extent any payment or benefit under the Plan is deemed to constitute an item of deferred compensation subject to the requirements of Code Section 409A, the provisions of the Plan applicable to that payment or benefit shall be applied, construed and administered so that such payment or benefit is made or provided in compliance with the applicable requirements of Code Section 409A. In addition, should there arise any ambiguity as to whether any other provisions of the Plan would contravene one or more applicable requirements or limitations of Code Section 409A and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, such provisions shall be interpreted, administered and applied in a manner that complies with the applicable requirements of Code Section 409A and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.
 
     The Company's Board of Directors or an authorized Board committee may, from time to time and at any time, amend the Plan and any of the benefits set forth in the Plan.
     Any amendment to the Plan may effect a substantial change in the Plan and may include (but shall not be limited to) (1) a reduction to the level of Severance Pay, COBRA Coverage Costs, Pro-Rata Vesting of Equity Awards and/or other benefits payable under the Plan, (2) a provision for the participation in the Plan by any subsidiary of the Company, (3) a change in the class or classes of persons to whom any Severance Pay, COBRA Coverage Costs and/or Pro-Rata Vesting of Equity Awards may be or become payable, and (4) any change deemed by the Company to be necessary or desirable to make the Plan conform to, or to enable Participants to obtain tax benefits under, any existing or future laws or rules or regulations thereunder.
 
     The Plan may be terminated at any time and for any reason by action of the Company's Board of Directors or an authorized Board committee.
 
     The adoption and maintenance of the Plan shall not be deemed to constitute a contract between the Company and any Eligible Employee or to be a consideration for, or an inducement or condition of, the employment of any person. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to give any Eligible Employee the right to be retained in the service of the Company or to interfere with the rights of the Company to discharge any Eligible Employee at any time. No Eligible Employee shall, because of the Plan, become entitled to any offer of relocation, lateral transfer, downgrade with pay protection, or any other term of employment.
 
     A. The Administrator shall provide such appropriate forms as it may deem expedient in the administration of the Plan.
     B. All communications concerning the Plan shall be in writing addressed to the Administrator at such address as the Administrator may from time to time designate, and no such communication shall be effective for any purpose unless received by the Administrator.
     C. The Administrator shall issue a summary plan description to the Eligible Employees describing the Plan. In the event of any conflict between the terms of the Plan, as set forth in the Plan and as set forth in the summary plan description, the Plan shall control.
 
     The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Arizona, except to the extent that the laws of the United States (including ERISA) take precedence and preempt state laws.

Exhibit 10.2
GRADE 18 LEVEL OR ABOVE
RECITALS
          A. The Corporation has implemented the Plan as an equity incentive program to encourage key employees and officers of the Corporation and the non-employee members of the Board to remain in the employ or service of the Corporation by providing them with an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the success of the Corporation.
          B. Participant is to render valuable services to the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary), and this Agreement is executed pursuant to, and is intended to carry out the purposes of, the Plan in connection with the Corporation's issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock to Participant under the Plan.
          C. All capitalized terms in this Agreement shall have the meaning assigned to them in the attached Appendix A.
, it is hereby agreed as follows:
NOW, THEREFORE
          1. . The Corporation hereby awards to Participant, as of the Award Date indicated below, an award (the "Award") of Performance Shares under the Plan. Each Performance Share which vests pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall provide Participant with the right to receive one or more shares of Class A Common Stock on the designated issuance date. The number of shares of Class A Common Stock subject to the awarded Performance Shares, the applicable performance vesting requirement for the Performance Shares, the rate at which the vested Performance Shares are to convert into shares of Class A Common Stock, the date on which the converted shares of Class A Common Stock shall become issuable and the remaining terms and conditions governing the Award, including the applicable service vesting requirement, shall be as set forth in this Agreement.
Grant of Performance Shares
 
 
          2. . Prior to the actual issuance of the shares of Class A Common Stock which vest hereunder, Participant may not transfer any interest in the performance shares subject to the Award or the underlying shares of Class A Common Stock or pledge or otherwise hedge the sale of those performance shares or the underlying shares of Class A Common Stock, including (without limitation) any short sale or any acquisition or disposition of any put or call option or other instrument tied to the value of the Class A Common Stock. However, any shares of Class A Common Stock which vest hereunder but otherwise remain unissued at the time of Participant's death may be transferred pursuant to the provisions of Participant's will or the laws of inheritance or to Participant's designated beneficiary or beneficiaries of this Award. Participant may make such a beneficiary designation at any time by filing the appropriate form with the Plan Administrator or its designate.
Limited Transferability
          3. .
Service Requirement
          (a) The number of Performance-Qualified Shares calculated in accordance with the Performance-Vesting provisions of Paragraph 1 and attached Schedule I represent the maximum number of shares of Class A Common Stock in which Participant can vest hereunder. The actual number of shares of Class A Common Stock in which Participant shall vest shall be determined by multiplying that number of Performance-Qualified Shares by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full fiscal years of Service completed by the Participant within the Performance Period and the denominator of which is the total number of fiscal years within that Performance Period.
          (b) Should the Participant cease Service prior to the completion of a particular fiscal year included within the Performance Period by reason of an Involuntary Termination, then following the completion of the Performance Period and the required certification of the number of Performance-Qualified Shares subject to this Award, Participant shall, with respect to such partial fiscal year of Service, vest in that additional number of shares of Class A Common Stock (if any) determined by multiplying the certified number of Performance-Qualified Shares by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months of Service actually completed by the Participant during that particular fiscal year (rounded up to the next whole month), and the denominator of which is the total number of months constituting the entire Performance Period.
          (c) Should the Participant's Service cease for any reason other than an Involuntary Termination prior to the completion of the Performance Period, then the Participant shall not vest in any additional Performance-Qualified Shares following such cessation of Service, and all of Participant's right, title and interest to any unvested Performance-Qualified Shares subject to this Award shall immediately terminate.
 
          4. The holder of this Award shall not have any stockholder rights, including voting, dividend or liquidation rights, with respect to the shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the Award until Participant becomes the record holder of those shares upon their actual issuance following the Corporation's collection of the applicable Withholding Taxes.
Stockholder Rights
.
          5. . The following provisions shall apply only to the extent a Change in Control is consummated prior to the completion of the Performance Period and shall have no force or effect in the event the effective date of the Change in Control occurs after the completion of such Performance Period.
Change in Control
               (a) Should (i) the Change in Control occur during the first eighteen (18) months of the Performance Period and (ii) the Participant continue in Service through the effective date of that Change in Control, then the Participant shall immediately vest in that number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the Target Number of Performance Shares set forth in Paragraph 1, without any measurement of Performance Goal attainment to date.
               (b) Should (i) the Change in Control occur at any time on or after the completion of the first eighteen (18) months of the Performance Period and (ii) the Participant continues in Service through the effective date of that Change in Control, then the Participant shall immediately vest in that number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the of:
greater
               (i) the Target Number of Performance Shares set forth in Paragraph 1, or
               (ii) the number of Performance-Qualified Shares determined by multiplying (A) the Target Number of Performance Shares set forth in Paragraph 1 by (B) the applicable percentage (determined in accordance with attached Schedule I) for the level at which the Performance Goal is attained and certified by the Plan Administrator for an abbreviated Performance Period ending with the close of the Corporation's fiscal quarter coincident with or immediately preceding the effective date of the Change in Control, with the applicable financial metric for the fiscal year in which the Change in Control is effected to be calculated and measured as of the close of the fiscal quarter coincident with or immediately preceding such effective date and compared to the applicable financial metric for the immediately preceding fiscal year calculated and measured over the same abbreviated time period within that fiscal year.
               (c) The share calculation procedures set forth in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Paragraph 5 shall also apply for purposes of determining the number of shares to which the Service-vesting provisions of Paragraph 3(a) and (if applicable) Paragraph 3(b) are to be applied in the event the Participant ceases Service during the Performance Period and prior to the effective date of the Change in Control, and the resulting number of shares shall be subject to the provisions of Paragraph 5(d) below.
 
               (d) The number of shares of Class A Common Stock in which Participant vests on the basis of the Performance Shares or Performance-Qualified Shares determined in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 5 shall be converted into the right to receive for each such share the same consideration per share of Class A Common Stock payable to the other holders of such Class A Common Stock in consummation of that Change in Control, and such consideration per share shall be distributed to the Participant at the same time as such stockholder payments, but in no event shall such distribution to the Participant be completed later than the of (i) the end of the calendar year in which such Change in Control is effected or (ii) the fifteenth (15th) day of the third (3rd) calendar month following the effective date of that Change in Control. The distribution shall be subject to the Corporation's collection of the applicable Withholding Taxes.
later
               (e) Except for the actual number of shares of Class A Common Stock in which the Participant vests in accordance with this Paragraph 5, the Participant shall cease to have any further right or entitlement to any additional shares of Class A Common Stock under this Agreement following the effective date of the Change in Control.
               (f) This Agreement shall not in any way affect the right of the Corporation to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets.
          6. . Should any change be made to the Class A Common Stock by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares, spin-off transaction, extraordinary dividend or distribution or other change affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without the Corporation's receipt of consideration, or should the value of the outstanding shares of Common Stock be substantially reduced as a result of a spin-off transaction or an extraordinary dividend or distribution, or should there occur any merger, consolidation or other reorganization, then equitable adjustments shall be made by the Plan Administrator to the total number and/or class of securities issuable pursuant to this Award in order to reflect such change. The determination of the Plan Administrator shall be final, binding and conclusive. In the event of any Change in Control transaction, the provisions of Paragraph 5 shall be controlling.
Adjustment in Shares
          7.
Issuance or Distribution of Vested Shares or Other Amounts.
               (a) Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 5, the shares of Class A Common Stock in which Participant vests pursuant to the Performance and Service vesting provisions of Paragraphs 1 and 3 shall be issued following the completion of the Performance Period, in accordance with the following provisions:
          (i) If the applicable Performance Period is coincidental with one or more successive fiscal years of the Corporation, the issuance shall be effected as soon as administratively practicable following the completion of that Performance Period, but no later than the of (A)
later
 
the last day of the calendar year in which such Performance Period ends or (B) the fifteenth (15th) day of third (3rd) calendar month following the last day of such Performance Period.
          (ii) If the applicable Performance Period is coincidental with one or more successive complete calendar years, the issuance shall be effected during the period beginning with the first business day of the calendar year immediately succeeding the end of the Performance Period and ending no later than March 15 of that year.
               (b) The Corporation shall, on the applicable issuance date, issue to or on behalf of Participant a certificate (which may be in electronic form) for the shares of Class A Common Stock in which Participant vests pursuant to the Performance and Service vesting provisions of Paragraphs 1 and 3 or the special vesting provisions of Paragraph 5.
               (c) Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 5, no shares of Class A Common Stock shall be issued prior to the completion of the Performance Period. No fractional share of Class A Common Stock shall be issued pursuant to this Award, and any fractional share resulting from any calculation made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be rounded down to the next whole share of Class A Common Stock.
               (d) The Corporation shall collect the applicable Withholding Taxes with respect to all shares of Class A Common Stock which vest and become issuable pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement through the following automatic share withholding method:
               - On the applicable issuance date, the Corporation shall withhold, from the vested shares of Class A Common Stock otherwise issuable to the Participant at that time, a portion of those shares with a Fair Market Value (measured as of the issuance date) equal to the applicable Withholding Taxes; , that the number of shares of Class A Common Stock which the Corporation shall be required to so withhold shall not exceed in Fair Market Value (other than by reason of the rounding up of any fractional share to the next whole share) the amount necessary to satisfy the Corporation's required tax withholding obligations using the minimum statutory withholding rates for federal and state tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to supplemental taxable income. The Participant hereby expressly authorizes the Corporation to withhold any such additional fractional share that is needed to round up the share withholding to the next whole share of Class A Common Stock, with the Fair Market Value of that additional fractional share to be added to the amount of taxes withheld by the Corporation from his or her wages for the calendar year in which the issuance date occurs, and to report that additional tax withholding as part of his or her W-2 tax withholdings for such year.
provided, however
 
               (e) Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 5 or this Paragraph 7, the settlement of all Performance or Performance-Qualified Shares which vest under the Award shall be made solely in shares of Class A Common Stock.
          8.
Code Section 409A
               (a) It is the intention of the parties that the provisions of this Agreement shall comply with the requirements of the short-term deferral exception to Section 409A of the Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4). Accordingly, to the extent there is any ambiguity as to whether one or more provisions of this Agreement would otherwise contravene the requirements or limitations of Code Section 409A applicable to such short-term deferral exception, then those provisions shall be interpreted and applied in a manner that does not result in a violation of the requirements or limitations of Code Section 409A and the Treasury Regulations thereunder that apply to such exception.
               (b) If and to the extent this Agreement may be deemed to create an arrangement subject to the requirements of Code Section 409A, then the following provisions shall apply:
          - No shares of Class A Common Stock or other amounts which become issuable or distributable under this Agreement by reason of Participant's cessation of Service shall actually be issued or distributed to Participant until the date of Participant's separation from service (as determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of Code Section 409A and the Treasury Regulations thereunder) or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, but in no event later than the of (i) the close of the calendar year in which such separation from service occurs or (ii) the fifteenth day of the third calendar month following the date of such separation from service.
later
          - No shares of Class A Common Stock or other amounts which become issuable or distributable under this Agreement by reason of Participant's cessation of Service shall actually be issued or distributed to Participant prior to the of (i) the first day of the seventh (7th) month following the date of the Participant's separation from service or (ii) the date of Participant's death, if Participant is deemed at the time of such separation from service to be a specified employee under Section 1.409A-1(i) of the Treasury Regulations issued under Code Section 409A, as determined by the Plan Administrator in accordance with consistent and uniform standards applied to all other Code Section 409A arrangements of the Corporation, and such delayed commencement is otherwise required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Code Section 409A(a)(2). The deferred shares or other distributable amount shall be issued or distributed in a lump sum on the first day of the seventh (7th) month following the date of Participant's separation from service or, if earlier, the first day of the month immediately following the date the Corporation receives proof of Participant's death.
earlier
 
          - No amounts that vest and become payable under Paragraph 5 of this Agreement by reason of a Change in Control shall be distributed to the Participant at the time of such Change in Control, unless that transaction also qualifies as a change in control event under Code Section 409A and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. In the absence of such a qualifying change in control, the distribution shall not be made until the specified completion date of the three (3)-year Performance Period or as soon as administratively practicable following thereafter, but in no event later than the fifteenth (15th) day of the third (3rd) calendar month following that date.
          9. .

PERFORMANCE PERIOD
The measurement period for the Performance Shares awarded to Participant shall be the three (3) fiscal-year period beginning September 1, 2010 and ending August 31, 2013 (the "Performance Period").
PERFORMANCE GOAL FOR PERFORMANCE VESTING
The Performance Goal shall be tied to the average of the actual annual growth rates of Adjusted Free Cash Flow (as defined and adjusted in accordance with the provisions set forth below) for each of the three (3) fiscal years comprising the Performance Period. In determining the average of those annual growth rates, the growth rate of defined Adjusted Free Cash Flow for the 2011 fiscal year will be determined by comparing the defined Adjusted Free Cash Flow for that year against the defined Adjusted Free Cash Flow for the 2010 fiscal year ending August 31, 2010. The growth in defined Adjusted Free Cash Flow for each of the two (2) remaining fiscal years in the Performance Period shall be calculated in comparison to the defined Adjusted Free Cash Flow realized for the immediately preceding fiscal year in that Performance Period. Once the growth rate in defined Adjusted Free Cash for each of the three (3) fiscal years in the Performance Period is calculated, the simple average of those three (3) annual growth rates will be determined, and that average (rounded up to the next whole one-tenth decimal point) will represent the actual level at which the Performance Goal has been attained.
Performance Goal  Adjusted Free Cash Flow:
     The threshold (40% conversion factor), target (100% conversion factor) and maximum (200% conversion factor) levels of the average of the annual growth rates of Adjusted Free Cash Flow for the Performance Period shall be as follows:
     Adjusted Free Cash Flow for each applicable fiscal year (whether the 2010 fiscal year or any fiscal year in the Performance Period) shall be calculated in accordance with the following parameters:
          First, the cash flow from operations for such fiscal year shall be determined on a consolidated basis with the Corporation's consolidated subsidiaries for financial reporting purposes and in accordance with current United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("U.S. GAAP") and shall be confirmed on the basis of the Corporation's audited
 
financial statements for that fiscal year. To the extent there are any other changes in U.S. GAAP during the Performance Period, the U.S. GAAP rules in effect on the Award Date shall continue to be utilized throughout the entire Performance Period.
          Then, the cash flow from operations as so determined for the relevant fiscal year shall be reduced by the following amounts:
          (i) cash amounts expended during that fiscal year in the acquisition of property, plant and equipment; and
          (ii) cash amounts paid during that fiscal year in the acquisition of businesses or assets whose primary function is other than the education of an enrolled student population.
          Next, the cash flow from operations for such fiscal year as so reduced shall be adjusted as follows: any increases during that fiscal year in restricted cash attributable to Title IV student funding shall be deducted from such cash flow, and any decreases during that fiscal year in such restricted cash shall added to that cash flow.
          The amount of cash flow resulting from the foregoing reductions and adjustments shall constitute the Adjusted Free Cash Flow for such fiscal year. However, in measuring the applicable growth rate in Adjusted Cash Flow for each of the fiscal years within the Performance Period for purposes of determining the level at which the Performance Goal is attained, such Adjusted Free Cash Flow shall, with respect to each fiscal year within the Performance Period, be subject to further adjustment by excluding each of the following amounts in the calculation of the defined Adjusted Free Cash Flow for that fiscal year:
          (i) cash amounts paid during that fiscal year for any costs related to an acquisition of businesses or assets within the Performance Period whose primary function is the education of an enrolled student population;
          (ii) cash amounts paid during that fiscal year as interest expense;
          (iii) cash amounts received during that fiscal year as interest income;
          (iv) cash amounts paid during that fiscal year in connection with judgments, verdicts and settlements with respect to the following litigation matters listed in the Commitments and Contingencies footnote of the Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2009, as set forth in the Form 10-K for that fiscal year filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission:
Litigation Matter
 
     Incentive Compensation False Claims Act Lawsuit filed March 7, 2003 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California
     In re Apollo Group, Inc. Securities Litigation, Case No. CV04-2147-PHX-JAT
     Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. University of Phoenix, No. CV-06-2303-PHX-MHM
     Barnett v. John Blair et al., Case No. CV2006-051558
     Bamboo Partners v. Nelson et al., Case No. CIV-06-1973-PHX-SRB
     Teamsters Local 617 Pension & Welfare Funds v. Apollo Group, Inc. et. al., Case Number 06-CV-02674-RCB; and
          (v) adjusted free cash flows (as calculated above) for that fiscal year attributable to any businesses or assets acquired within the Performance Period whose primary function is the education of an enrolled student population.
     The actual number of Performance-Qualified Shares may range from 0% to 200% of the Target Number of Performance Shares designated in Paragraph 1 of this Agreement, with the actual percentage to be determined on the basis of the simple average of the annual growth rates of Adjusted Free Cash Flow realized for each of the three (3) fiscal years included within the Performance Period, as certified by the Plan Administrator. Accordingly, the Performance Shares subject to this Award shall convert into a number of Performance-Qualified Shares determined by multiplying the Target Number of Performance Shares set forth in Paragraph 1 of this Agreement by the percentage in the schedule below that corresponds to the average of the actual annual growth rates of Adjusted Free Cash Flow certified by the Plan Administrator for each of the three (3) fiscal years comprising the Performance Period. In no event, however, shall the maximum number of the shares of the Corporation's Class A Common Stock that may qualify as Performance-Qualified Shares exceed 200% of the Target Number of Performance Shares set forth in Paragraph 1 of this Agreement.
Performance-Qualified Shares:
     The number of shares of the Corporation's Class A Common Stock that may qualify as Performance-Qualified Shares on the basis of the certified simple average of the annual growth rates of Adjusted Free Cash Flow for each of the three fiscal years in the Performance Period shall be calculated by multiplying the Target Number of Performance Shares designated in Paragraph 1 of this Agreement by the applicable percentage for that average annual growth rate determined in accordance with the following schedule:
Schedule for Determining Number of Performance-Qualified Shares Based on Attained Average of the Annual Growth Rates of Adjusted Free Cash Flow:
 

Exhibit 10.3
     The Apollo Group, Inc. 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, as previously amended and restated (the "Plan"), is hereby further amended, effective June 24, 2010, as follows:
     1. Section 3.1(r) of the Plan is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:
     (r) "Performance Criteria" means the criteria that the Committee selects for purposes of establishing the Performance Goals for a Participant for a Performance Period. The Performance Criteria that will be used to establish Performance Goals are limited to the following: pre-tax or after-tax net earnings or net income, sales or revenue growth, operating earnings, cash flow objectives, operating cash flows, free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures and adjusted for increases or decreases in restricted cash), return on net assets, return on stockholders' equity, return on assets, return on capital or invested capital, Stock price growth, stockholder returns, gross or net profit margin, earnings per share, price per share of Stock, market share, operating income, net operating income or net operating income after tax, operating profit or net operating profit, operating margin, earnings before interest and taxes, earnings before taxes, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and charges for stock-based compensation, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, economic value-added models, cost reductions, budget objectives, litigation and regulatory resolution goals, expense control goals, any of which may be measured either in absolute terms or as compared to any incremental increase or as compared to results of a peer group or as measured in terms of one or more business units or Subsidiaries of the Company. The Committee shall, within the time prescribed by Section 162(m) of the Code, define in an objective fashion the manner of calculating the Performance Criteria it selects to use for such Performance Period for such Participant.
     2. Section 3.1(s) of the Plan is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:
     (s) "Performance Goals" means, for a Performance Period, the goals established in writing by the Committee for the Performance Period based upon the Performance Criteria. Depending on the Performance Criteria used to establish such Performance Goals the Performance Goals may be expressed in terms of overall Company performance or the performance of a division, business unit, or an individual. The Committee, in its discretion, may, at the time the Performance Goal or Goals for the Performance Period are established, provide for one or more adjustments or modifications to the calculation of such Performance Goal or Goals in order to prevent the dilution or enlargement of the rights of Participants (i) in the event of, or in anticipation of, any unusual or extraordinary corporate item, transaction, event or development or (ii) in
 
recognition of, or in anticipation of, any other unusual or nonrecurring events affecting the Company or the financial statements of the Company, or in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in applicable laws, regulations, accounting principles or business conditions.
     In addition, should the Performance Goal be tied to operating cash flow or free cash flow objectives, then the Committee may, in establishing the applicable targets, authorize adjustments, deductions and/or exclusions with respect to one or more of the following items to the extent those items are to be utilized in the calculation of operating cash flow or free cash flow for any or all of the fiscal years within the applicable Performance Period and/or any other fiscal year that serves as a base or comparative measurement year:
          (i) cash amounts expended in the acquisition of property, plant and equipment,
          (ii) cash amounts paid in connection with actual or proposed acquisitions of one or more businesses or the assets of one or more businesses,
          (iii) cash flows or adjusted cash flows attributable to any businesses or assets acquired during the Performance Period (or other relevant measurement period),
          (iv) cash amounts paid as interest expense,
          (v) cash amounts received as interest income,
          (vi) cash amounts paid in connection with judgments, verdicts and settlements with respect to specified litigation matters, and
          (vii) increases or decreases in restricted cash attributable to Title IV student funding.
     In further clarification of the various adjustments that may be made to one or more Performance Goals in accordance with this Section 3.1(s) and without limiting the scope or generality of those permissible adjustments, should the Performance Goal be tied to any net income or operating profit objectives, then the Committee may, in establishing the applicable net income or operating profit target, authorize one or more of the following adjustments to net income or operating profit for any fiscal year within the applicable Performance Period:
     (i) the exclusion of all acquisition costs expensed for the applicable fiscal year, whether relating to acquisitions effected during that year or any prior fiscal year,
     (ii) the exclusion of all income or loss attributable to companies or other entities acquired during the applicable fiscal year,
 
     (iii) the exclusion of impairment charges related to goodwill, intangible assets or other long-lived assets,
     (iv) the exclusion of amounts expensed in connection with judgments, verdicts and settlements with respect to specified litigation matters,
     (v) the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense or costs, as computed in accordance with applicable accounting principles, and
     (vi) any other applicable adjustments authorized in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.1(s)."
     3. Article 9 of the Plan is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:
     "9.1 GRANT OF PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS. The Committee is authorized to grant Performance Share Awards to Participants on such terms and conditions as may be selected by the Committee. The Committee shall have the complete discretion to determine the number of shares of Stock that may be issued under each such Award of Performance Shares upon the attainment of the applicable performance objectives. All Performance Share Awards shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement.
          9.2 VESTING AND ISSUANCE PROVISIONS.
          (a) Performance Shares awarded under the Plan shall be structured and implemented in accordance with the following guidelines:
          (1) The Committee shall, at the time of the Award, establish (i) the applicable performance objectives that must be attained in order for the Performance Share Award to vest, (ii) the applicable performance period (which is to be of at least one year but not more than five (5) years in duration) over which those performance objectives are to be attained, (iii) the additional service vesting requirements to be completed during the performance period and (iv) the issuance date or dates on which the shares of Stock subject to a vested Performance Share Award are to be issued. The vesting and issuance provisions applicable to each Performance Share Award, including the additional service vesting requirements set by the Committee for completion during the applicable performance period, shall be set forth in the Award Agreement.
 
          (2) At the end of the performance period, the Committee shall determine the actual level of attainment for each performance objective and the extent to which the Performance Shares awarded for that period are to vest and become payable based on the attained performance levels and the satisfaction of the applicable service vesting requirements.
          (3) The Performance Shares which so vest shall be paid as soon as practicable following the end of the performance period, unless such payment is to be deferred for the period specified by the Committee at the time the Performance Shares are awarded or the period selected by the Participant in accordance with the applicable requirements of Code Section 409A. The Committee, in its discretion, may also at the time of the Award structure one or more Performance Shares Awards so that an additional period of employment or service with the Company following the completion of the performance period is required in order for the Participant to vest in the Performance Shares.
          (4) Performance Shares shall be paid and settled shares of Stock, except to the extent (if any) otherwise set forth in the Award Agreement.
          (5) Performance Shares may also be structured so that such shares shall be converted into actual shares of Stock based on a conversion rate that varies with the level at which each applicable performance objective is actually attained.
          (b) The Committee shall also have the discretionary authority, consistent with Code Section 162(m), to structure one or more Performance Share Awards so that the shares of Stock subject to those Awards shall vest upon the achievement of pre-established corporate performance objectives based on one or more Performance Goals and measured over the performance period specified by the Committee at the time of the Award.
          (c) The Participant shall not have any stockholder rights with respect to the shares of Stock subject to a Performance Share Award until that Award vests and the shares of Stock are actually issued thereunder. However, the Committee may structure one or more Performance Share Awards so that the applicable Award Agreement provides that dividend-equivalent units shall be credited on outstanding Performance Share Awards and subsequently paid, either in cash or in actual shares of Stock, subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may deem appropriate, but in no event shall any such dividend-equivalent units vest or otherwise become payable prior to the time the underlying Performance Share Award vests, and any such credited dividend equivalents shall accordingly be subject to cancellation and forfeiture to the same extent as the underlying Performance Share Award in the event the applicable performance objectives are not attained.
          (d) Except as otherwise set forth in Section 9(e), outstanding Performance Share Awards shall terminate, and no shares of Stock shall actually be issued in settlement of those Awards, if the performance goals established for those Awards are not attained. In no event may any vesting requirements tied to the attainment of Performance Goals be waived with
 
respect to Performance Share Awards that were intended, at the time those Awards were made, to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m), except as otherwise provided in Section 9.2(e) or Section 13.8.
          (e) Each Performance Share Award outstanding at the time of a Change in Control shall vest at that time, and the number of shares of Stock that would otherwise be issuable under such Award at target level attainment of the applicable performance objectives (or such other level of attainment as is specified in the Award Agreement) shall be issued as soon as administratively practicable following the closing of the Change in Control transaction, subject to the Company's collection of all applicable withholding taxes. Alternatively, the number of shares of Stock otherwise issuable under that Performance Share Award at such target or other specified level shall be converted at that applicable level into the right to receive the same consideration per share of Stock payable to the actual holders of the Stock in consummation of the Change in Control and distributed at the same time as those stockholder payments, subject to the Company's collection of the applicable withholding taxes. Such automatic vesting of the Performance Share Awards at target or other specified level attainment shall occur pursuant to this Section 9.2(e), even though such acceleration may result in their loss of performance-based status under Code Section 162(m)."
     4. Except as modified by this Plan Amendment, all the terms and provisions of the Plan as in effect immediately prior to such amendment shall continue in full force and effect.
          has caused this Plan Amendment to be executed on its behalf by its duly-authorized officers on this 24th day of June 2010.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, APOLLO GROUP, INC.

     Today, Apollo Group, Inc. (the "Company") announced that it has received a request for information from the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions relating to the Committee's ongoing hearings relating to for-profit colleges receiving Title IV student financial aid. The request seeks information to more accurately understand how the Company uses Federal resources, including how it recruits and enrolls students, sets program price or tuition, determines financial aid including private or institutional loans, tracks attendance, handles withdrawal of students and return of Title IV dollars and manages compliance with the requirement that no more than 90% of revenues come from Title IV dollars. The request also seeks an understanding of the number of students who complete or graduate from programs offered by the Company, how many of those students find new work in their educational area, the debt levels of students enrolling and completing programs and how the Company tracks and manages the number of students who risk default within the cohort default rate window.
     In furtherance of this, the Committee has requested that the Company provide information about a broad spectrum of the Company's business, including detailed information relating to financial results, management, operations, personnel, recruiting, enrollment, graduation, student withdrawals, receipt of Title IV funds, institutional accreditation, regulatory compliance and other matters. The Company intends to cooperate with the Committee and to work with the Committee to provide the requested information in a manner that does not compromise the Company's sensitive proprietary operating and other information.
     The Committee has requested that the Company produce a portion of the specified information by August 26, 2010 and the remainder of the information by September 16, 2010.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
     Today, Apollo Group, Inc. announced that its subsidiary, University of Phoenix, Inc., has received a letter from the Higher Learning Commission ("HLC") requiring the University to provide certain information and evidence of compliance with HLC accreditation standards. HLC is a regional accrediting body recognized by the U.S. Department of Education and is the principal accreditor of University of Phoenix and its programs. The HLC letter relates to the recent report published by the U.S. Government Accountability Office ("GAO") of its undercover investigation into the enrollment and recruiting practices of a number of for-profit institutions of higher education, including University of Phoenix.
     The letter requires that University of Phoenix submit a report to HLC by September 1, 2010 that addresses the specific GAO allegations regarding University of Phoenix and any remedial measures being undertaken in response to the GAO report. In addition, the report must include (i) evidence demonstrating that University of Phoenix, on a university-wide basis, currently is meeting and in the future will meet the HLC Criteria for Accreditation relating to operating with integrity and compliance with all state and federal laws, (ii) evidence that University of Phoenix has adequate systems in place which currently and in the future will assure appropriate control of all employees engaged in the recruiting, marketing or admissions process, (iii) evidence demonstrating that Apollo Group is not encouraging inappropriate behavior on the part of recruiters and is taking steps to encourage appropriate behavior, and (iv) detailed information about University of Phoenix policies, procedures and practices relating to marketing, recruiting, admissions and other related matters.
     The letter indicates that if the response by University of Phoenix is unsatisfactory, HLC may impose additional monitoring or sanctions at its meeting in November 2010.
     University of Phoenix believes it is in full compliance with the HLC accreditation criteria and Apollo Group and University of Phoenix intend to cooperate fully with HLC in this matter.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
PHOENIX, August 23, 2010 Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) and University of Phoenix today released a report examining the significant challenges facing America's higher education system and the fundamental transformations that must occur to meet President Obama's mandate that the United States produce the highest percentage of college graduates of any developed nation by 2020. The report, "Higher Education at a Crossroads," includes an analysis of the vital role proprietary colleges and universities play in meeting the President's goals and reaffirms University of Phoenix's commitment to advancing quality education, innovations in learning, and industry-leading student protections.
"We share the President's vision of a future in which Americans once again lead the world in higher education," said Greg Cappelli, Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer. "Education Secretary Arne Duncan has affirmed the vital role proprietary institutions will continue to play in realizing this vision. Our report lays out the ways in which institutions like University of Phoenix are uniquely positioned to increase access to higher education for all Americans at a significantly lower cost to society and without compromising quality."
Key findings of "Higher Education at a Crossroads" include:

Pepicello, President of University of Phoenix. "We are dedicated to helping non-traditional students achieve their life and career goals through innovative, quality education. We strive to continually improve, and we are committed to providing the best education and strongest student protections possible."

Executive Summary
We will address these questions in this report.
What kind of nation will we be a decade or two from now? Will our system of higher education be the bridge that takes us to a safer, stronger future, or will it be a burden that holds us back?
---
At Apollo Group, we believe America is at a crossroads with respect to the future direction of higher education. We find ourselves at a point in time when weas a nation, as citizens, as policy makers and as leaders in educationmust make a choice between defining ourselves as a nation in the 21 century with a limited, educated elite class who enjoy the benefits of a college degree (and all of the corresponding professional, financial and personal benefits that a degree brings) or a society with a broadly educated, productive and globally competitive workforce.
st
The choice is clear. It is imperative to recognize that the world and the labor force of today is much different than the one of a century ago when much of the traditional higher education system was established and when the United States was still a largely agrarian economy, or even several decades ago when it was the world's manufacturing powerhouse.
Salient evidence supports this position. In 1950 (when the U.S. economy was largely driven by manufacturing and assembly line workers) only about 20% of jobs required a skilled or educated worker. . And not surprisingly, it is expected that the fastest growing jobs in the coming decade will require a college level degree or higher.
Today, with knowledge as the backbone of our information-based economy, more than 60% of jobs require advanced skills training or education
1
2
As a result, more Americans than ever need a college degree and are seeking access to higher education in order to remain competitive and advance in their careers. However, despite the shift in educational requirements for jobs over the years, currently only 35% of American workers over the age of 25 have achieved a four-year degree. There are approximately 132 million Americans in the U.S. labor force over the age of 25, of whom over 80 million do not have a bachelor's degree. What's worse, and more than . According to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report, the U.S. has lost its number one competitive ranking in the world.
50 million Americans have never started college
30 million have never completed their degree

Recognizing this problem, the Obama administration last year set forth three important goals for the U.S. higher education system that are critical to the country regaining its standing as a leader in education and to remain competitive in an increasingly global economy. Those goals include:
5
We applaud these goals and agree with the President's recognition of the importance of fostering a broadly educated society in order to keep America competitive as a nation.
---
Unfortunately, the country faces numerous challenges in achieving these goals.
First among them is a K-12 system that is not preparing students for college-level study as well as it once did. The nationwide dropout rate of high school students in 2008-2009 was
"Let me be crystal clear: for-profit institutions play a vital role in training young people and adults for jobs. They are critical to helping America meet the President's 2020 goal. They are helping us meet the explosive demand for skills that public institutions cannot always meet."
- Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, May 11, 2010
"At the start of my administration I set a goal for America: by 2020, this nation will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. We used to have that. We're going to have it again."
- President Barack Obama, July 14, 2010
 
approximately 30% and it was significantly higher in major urban areas, reaching 55% in both New York City and Los Angeles. Equally striking, of students who make it to the twelfth grade, 65% of them cannot read at a twelfth grade level and 77% are not proficient in math at a twelfth grade level.

7
Despite the U.S. spending more on K-12 education per pupil than almost any other country, deficiencies at the K-12 level have caused the U.S. position in international testing to slip when compared to other nations, and we now rank 21 out of 30 OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries in science scores and 25 out of the same 30 countries in math scores (both measured at age 15).

In addition to more students being inadequately prepared for college-level study, increasing numbers of working learners who never started or never completed their college education (many of whom have not been in a classroom environment in years) are now recognizing the need for a college degree in order to retool their skills or advance in their careers.
Both of these factorsa greater number of less prepared high school graduates and a greater number of working adults now looking to attain a degreeare placing burdens on a higher education system that was not built to accommodate the needs of these individuals. And these burdens come at a time when public funding for higher education is under pressure and budgets and capacity are being cut at traditional schools. Without the skills essential to a knowledge-driven economy, America will continue to lose ground in its economic competitiveness.
---
At Apollo Group, we are concerned that our country will not meet the national education goals set forth by the President without a postsecondary system that can serve the needs of more non-traditional students than was originally intended.
Traditional schoolspublic and independent private colleges and universitiesare the backbone of the U.S. higher education system, but they alone cannot meet the demands of our society. We believe innovation and new alternatives are required to adapt to our rapidly changing world.
In order to meet just one of President Obama's national education goalsensuring that every American receives one year of collegewe estimate it would require the traditional education system to provide access to more than 50 million first-time students, hire and train 500,000 new faculty members, create 1-2 million additional classes, and build the equivalent of thousands of new colleges and universities. .
10
Furthermore, we estimate that utilizing public institutions alone would cost the taxpayers
more than $800 billion
over the next ten years to educate the additional 13.1 million graduates necessary to meet President Obama's goal of America once again having the highest graduation rate among developed countries by 2020
11
Achieving this feat would be monumental in itself, but to do so at a time when traditional schools' resources are under pressure makes the task a near impossibility. Thirty-nine states have cut funding to public colleges and universities in the past year alone and schools are being forced to cut faculty positions and student seat capacity just to remain viable.
12
---
Accredited, degree-granting proprietary institutions (also known as for-profit institutions) play a critical role in the future of education by providing access to students who previously have been left behind by or excluded from the traditional higher education system in the U.S. Today's students have families and professional obligations that make it challenging to pursue a college degree and successfully make it through to graduation. Already, 73% of U.S.
 
students are classified as non-traditional by the Department of Education, meaning they have risk factors that make it more difficult to reach graduation, such as working while attending school or having dependents of their own. Proprietary institutions like University of Phoenix (a subsidiary of Apollo Group) are meeting the needs of today's working learners, and students are responding to the value proposition of this educational offering. We do this by providing flexible scheduling, a choice of online or campus-based classrooms, small class sizes, degree programs relevant to today's workforce, faculty who have professional experience in their field of instruction, and high levels of student support to help students succeed. These adaptations and innovations have enabled University of Phoenix to provide strong academic outcomes as well as career enhancement opportunities to students who in many cases carry a higher level of educational risk as defined by the Department of Education. This does not mean that these students are less talented or incapable of learning, but rather it's a recognition that sometimes life gets in the way.
13
Funding for education is provided directly to students, and students are choosing to attend certain proprietary institutions because of the factors mentioned above. By questioning whether proprietary institutions are the recipients of too much financial aid funding, critics are actually questioning whether non-traditional and socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals deserve the right to have access to the same student financial aid funds, and thus access to an education, as more affluent students do. If we are to meet any of President Obama's goals, we believe the answer must be yes.
, as they do not receive direct state subsidies and do not benefit from tax-free endowment contributions. Rather, proprietary institutions pay significant taxes back to the public coffers. We estimate the annual net cost to society, inclusive of defaults on student loans, is approximately $1,509 per student at University of Phoenix compared with a cost of $7,051 per student at independent private institutions and $11,340 per student at public institutions. Given these figures, we estimate that having a properly regulated and healthy proprietary postsecondary education system in this country would allow the President to reach his higher education goals while spending the $800 billion necessary to do the same thing through the traditional college system alone.
It is important to note that proprietary institutions

Apollo Group is playing a leadership role in higher education, and we are proud of our heritage in helping to pioneer higher education for the working learner over 35 years ago, followed by the introduction of online education over 20 years ago. In addition, we are currently investing hundreds of millions of dollars into the next-generation of learners by developing a world-class adaptive learning platform designed for the classroom of tomorrow.
Critics of the proprietary postsecondary sector have raised concerns about industry recruiting practices, student outcomes and student debt levels. While Apollo Group and University of Phoenix strive for excellence in all of these areas, we recognize that we can continue to improve. In this paper, we discuss some of the misperceptions about University of Phoenix and our students, as well as some of the initiatives we have undertaken to deliver continued improvement. Importantly, we are committed to delivering a quality education to those who are willing to work hard enough to realize its benefits. Recognizing that we were experiencing an increasing number of students who were less prepared for the rigors of our degree programs, in early 2009 University of Phoenix began testing and recently announced the full implementation of a University Orientation program. This three week program will be offered at to students and is designed to ensure that prospective students understand the time and commitment required to be successful in our rigorous programs of study to

enrolling in our University. This is especially important as it allows students to make a fully informed decision about attending our University before taking on college debt.
Apollo Group and University of Phoenix strive to always act in the best interests of our students. Our goal is to help educate some of the 50 million Americans in our labor force today who have never attempted college either because they didn't realize it was available to them or didn't think it was possible. And, importantly, we understand that simply enrolling students for the sake of financial gains will never prove successful in the end. Why? Because we believe that only by consistently providing a strong value proposition to our students can our shareholders generate sustainable returns over time. It's that simple.
To that end, we've implemented a series of additional student protections including financial literacy tools such as our Responsible Borrower Calculator, which encourages students to borrow the amount they need for their education. Critics are right to point out that the cost of college has increased dramatically over the past several decades, causing students in certain institutions to take on unusually high levels of debt. At University of Phoenix, the majority of our degree granting programs are either at or below the federal Title IV loan limits set by Congress. And, importantly, despite the fact that we cannot restrict a student's ability to borrow up to the federally set Title IV limits, total student debt levels at University of Phoenix are within national averages when compared to both public and independent private four-year colleges and universities.
only
Robust and enforced regulatory compliance is critical to the future of any university, and our universities are no exception. Our students have access to a compliance hotline 24 hours per day, and we monitor over 30,000 conversations per day between our current as well as prospective students and our counselors. To further reinforce that our counselors are not pressured in any way to enroll a student who is not ready or prepared for University of Phoenix, we have announced that a new evaluation and compensation plan for our counselors will be rolled out University wide beginning this fall. Rather, our counselors will be evaluated on and compensated for always acting in the best interest of the studentessentially, advising the student the way they would a brother, sister, son, daughter, or close friend. We feel strongly that the new plan will further solidify our goal of always putting the student first.
In this new plan,
no part
of a counselor's compensation will have any link to the number of students they enroll at our University.
At Apollo Group, we strive to demonstrate responsible, ethical leadership in higher education. We recognize that it is Apollo Group's role to ensure regulatory compliance at University of Phoenix and our other institutions. To help ensure this, we have a large dedicated team of full-time compliance professionals at Apollo Group. Compliance starts at the top, and we are striving to be the best in this critical area. Further, on occasions where we find mistakes or compliance violations, we strive to handle them with the urgency, care and attention they deserve.
---
Above all, University of Phoenix invests heavily in its students' education and student services, as well as in building the learning environment of tomorrow. Educational and instructional spending is by far our highest category of expenditure, while our marketing costs to enroll a new student are generally in-line with the average of all schools in the U.S.
16
Ultimately, the value of the education we deliver to our students is the determinant of the long-term success of our institution, as positive outcomes yield success for our graduates. The University delivers value to its students and transparently publishes its outcomes so that students can make informed decisions. We are proud of our record and highlight the following achievements:
 
---
In today's world we need on-demand, rapidly deployed, effective education. Today's working learners need industry-adaptive faculty and curriculumfaculty who are active in their fields of instruction and teach curriculum that can immediately be applied in the workforce. Educational programs need to prepare students for today's economy, not the economy of yesterday.
By providing an accessible, high quality education, University of Phoenix is producing successful outcomesgraduates who are better positioned to enjoy the professional, financial and personal benefits that a degree brings, as well as a more educated, competitive society as a whole.
Through a framework of thoughtful and consistent regulation, well managed proprietary colleges and universitiesthose that are committed to responsible, ethical practices and regulatory complianceplay a vital role in the future of America's higher education system, helping it to rise to the challenge of meeting the needs of the millions of non-traditional learners and producing the graduates necessary to achieve the nation's shared educational and economic goals. Apollo Group is committed to leading the nation towards this future.
 
The Current State of Higher Education
We believe America is at a crossroads with respect to the future direction of higher education in this country. We are standing at a point in time when weas a nation, as citizens, as policy makers and as leaders in educationmust make a choice. We must either define ourselves as a nation with only a small, educated elite class who enjoy the benefits of a college degree (and all of the corresponding professional, financial and personal benefits that it brings) or as a society with a broadly educated, productive and globally-competitive workforce.
---
Why Does Higher Education Matter?
In case that choice isn't clear, it is imperative to recognize that postsecondary education brings considerable benefits to both individuals who attain higher degrees, as well as society as a whole. Individuals benefit from greater professional opportunity, higher earnings potential and a lower incidence of unemployment.

Can the Higher Education System Stand Still When the World is Changing Around It?
Despite the obvious personal and societal benefits of higher education, it is imperative to recognize that the world and the labor force of today is much different than the one of a century ago. The traditional higher education system was originally established when the United States was still a largely agrarian economy and thrived as America became the manufacturing powerhouse of the world. The world, and our economy, has changed significantly.
 
Consider a few facts. In 1950 (when the U.S. economy was largely driven by manufacturing and assembly line workers) only about 20% of jobs required a skilled or educated worker. But the days when an individual could raise a family on an unskilled manufacturing or assembly line job are in rapid decline. .
Today, with knowledge as the backbone of our information-based economy, more than 60% of jobs require advanced skills training or education

And not surprisingly, it is expected that the fastest growing jobs in the coming decade are those that will require a college level degree or higher.

As a result, more Americans than ever need a college degree and are seeking access to higher education in order to remain competitive and advance in their careers. However, despite this shift, currently only 35% of American workers have achieved a four-year degree. The remaining two-thirds of all U.S. workers over the age of 25 (more than 80 million people in the labor force today) do not have a four-year degree. Of those individuals, approximately and an additional .

Importantly, today's knowledge-based jobs are portable across geographic boundaries. If American workers do not have the necessary education and skills to meet the job requirements, it is likely someone else will. Unfortunately, according to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report, the U.S. has already lost its number one competitive ranking in the world.

Can America's Higher Education System Rise to Meet These Challenges?
Greater numbers of less prepared high school graduates and greater numbers of working learners now looking to attain a degree are placing burdens on a higher education system that was not built to accommodate the needs of these individuals, as it requires significantly expanding capacity to reach greater numbers of students who also require a higher level of academic and student support services than students of the past.
In addition to this dynamic, these factors are placing increased burdens on the traditional postsecondary system at a time when public funding for higher education is under pressure and budgets and capacity are being cut at traditional schools.
Traditional schoolspublic and independent private colleges and universitiesare the backbone of the U.S. higher education system, but they alone cannot meet the demands.

Furthermore, to increase the capacity of public institutions to meet President Obama's goal of America once again having the highest graduation rate among developed countries by 2020, we estimate that it would cost hundreds of billions of dollars over the next ten years, as we detail later in this report.

As we discuss in this paper, traditional public and independent private institutions play an important role within the higher education system; however, due to the physical and financial limitations of the traditional university model, they do so at a significantly higher cost to the taxpayer than proprietary institutions (even when considering higher student loan default rates at proprietary institutions).
For traditional institutions, delivering quality education generally relies upon a high fixed-cost, ground-based system of learning that requires significant investments in physical infrastructuredormitories, cafeterias, athletic centers, parking facilities, etc. It also requires both locally domiciled students and locally available faculty, meaning that it can serve only a limited population of students within a limited distance.
This systemwhether by design or due to resource constraint is rigid and, at times, inflexible in the way that it adapts educational curriculum and incorporates advances in technology and information systems to meet the needs of today's working learners. As such, the economics underlying the traditional schools' asset-intensive, high cost structure have been essentially unchanged over time.
We believe it would be extremely difficult to scale the traditional model to meet the increasing demand for higher education generated by a globally competitive, knowledge-based economy without either major public funding increases (borne by a tax revenue system currently under significant budgetary strain) or a dramatic restructuring of the way in which the entire postsecondary system currently operates.
Given this, we are concerned that the country will not meet the national education goals set forth by the President without a postsecondary system that operates differently than it has in the pastone that is able to and deliver quality academic programs and student service to best serve the needs of today's working learners.

efficiently
Proprietary colleges and universities are playing an increasingly critical role in meeting these needs.
 
The Role of Proprietary Institutions
Despite the staggering demand for higher education and the challenges that will need to be met in order to satisfy it, some industry observers have questioned the role proprietary institutions play in the postsecondary education system.
The U.S. postsecondary education system is very sizeable with approximately 6,600 schools. Included in this number are approximately 4,400 degree-granting institutions and 2,200 non-degree granting institutions. The proprietary sector represents about 2,800 of the total, of which approximately 1,100 are degree-granting and 1,700 are not. This sector is extremely diverse as it includes technical and vocational schools (massage, beauty and culinary) that are typically nationally accredited, as well as regionally accredited degree-granting institutions such as University of Phoenix. There are six regional accrediting bodies in the U.S.
37
We firmly believe that while not all proprietary institutions are the same, accredited, degree-granting schools that comply with regulations play a critical role in meeting the needs of today's non-traditional students, and they do so at a significantly lower cost to the taxpayer than traditional public or private independent schools. Well managed proprietary institutions provide strong academic quality and career outcomes for their students, providing them with services and capabilities that are not found at many traditional institutions. These proprietary institutions have been strong sources of academic and educational innovation deploying new technologies including online and distance learning, networking and technology infrastructure, new learning models and systems, networked faculty, distributed campus footprints, and service and support critical to helping working learners complete their educational degrees.
In fact, without proprietary colleges and universities, we believe America will not be able to meet President Obama's national education goals.
---
What are the Realities of Today's "Non-traditional" Students?
Accredited, degree-granting proprietary institutions play a critical role in the future of education by providing access to students who previously have been left behind by or excluded from the traditional higher education system. Today's students have family and professional obligations that make it challenging to pursue a college degree and successfully make it through to graduation. Already, 73% of U.S. students are classified as non-traditional by the Department of Education, meaning they have risk factors that make it more difficult to reach graduation, such as working while attending school or having dependents of their own.
38
 
Exhibit 8: Undergraduates with Non-traditional Characteristics

These non-traditional students are typically older, financially independent (meaning they lack parental financial support), from lower income families, minority and female. These demographic differences largely drive adverse reported quality metrics, such as lower retention and graduation rates, and higher loan default rates.
Exhibit 9: Student Demographics by Institution Type
Source: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics.
 
Proprietary institutions like University of Phoenix are meeting the needs of today's working learners by innovating to provide flexible scheduling, a choice of online or campus-based classrooms, small class sizes, degree programs relevant to today's workforce, faculty who have professional experience in their field of instruction, and high levels of student support to help students succeed.
If we as a nation are to meet President Obama's goals of once again having the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020, encouraging every American to have at least one year of college, and encouraging lifelong learning for all Americans, finding the means and capacity to successfully educate non-traditional students is essential.
---
Do Students at Proprietary Institutions Receive a Disproportionate Share of Student Aid Funding?
Some industry critics point to the growth in federal aid dollars that have gone to proprietary institutions in recent years, while not recognizing the fact that student aid dollars follow the students (not the institutions) and student demographics are a primary determinant of the amount of financial aid and student debt.
Students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, who are more prevalent at institutions that choose not to focus on only the elite, disproportionately qualify for need-based Pell Grants. In addition, the recent introduction of the year-round Pell Grant program creates the potential for the neediest students to receive up to 100% of additional Pell Grants in the same award year provided they are continuously enrolled. Since many proprietary institutions are typically based on a continuous enrollment model, it is likely that even more Pell Grant funds will be granted to students attending these institutions. On the other hand, the traditional term-based institutions generally have limited numbers of students enrolled continuously (i.e., a small percentage of students attend the summer term).
Additionally, institutions (proprietary or otherwise) have no legal right to limit the amount of debt a student is entitled to borrow, which inhibits an institution's ability to put controls on students who over borrow. For many students at University of Phoenix, this results in their being able to borrow up to the maximum of the Title IV loan limits, which are set by Congress.
Not surprisingly, financial independence (the lack of parental financial support) of non-traditional students drives higher borrowing needs among students at proprietary institutions. Despite these needs, .
students at four-year proprietary institutions still borrow less, on average, than those at four-year independent private institutions

While the average Pell Grant per eligible student at all institutions, including University of Phoenix, has increased over time, the average Pell Grant per eligible student at University of Phoenix is below the average for students at other institutions ($2,826 in fiscal 2009 compared with $2,971 at all institutions).

By questioning whether proprietary institutions are the recipients of too much financial aid funding, critics are actually questioning whether socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals deserve the right to have access to the same student financial aid funds, and thus access to an education, as more affluent students do. If we are to meet any of President Obama's goals, we believe the answer must be yes.

Do Proprietary Institutions Overburden Students with Debt?
The average borrowing of students in proprietary bachelor's degree programs is $24,635, which equates to a monthly loan payment of $283.50 over ten years (assuming the current 6.8% interest rate associated with most student loans, as set by Congress). The net monthly cost to the student is even lower when taking into consideration the personal income tax benefit they receive on deductible student loan expenses.
42
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Current Population Study), the difference in weekly earnings between a high school graduate and a person with a bachelor's degree is $399 per week, or $1,729 per month, well in excess of the cost of the average loan repayment. Furthermore, this higher level of earnings for a college graduate continues beyond just the ten-year loan repayment period.

Do Students of Proprietary Institutions Default Too Frequently?
Some industry observers point to higher default rates for students of proprietary schools as evidence that proprietary institutions are not providing a quality education that is valued in the marketplace. These observers do not recognize that demographics (not institution type) have a more meaningful impact on default rates.
According to a report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), "Academic researchers have found that higher default rates at proprietary schools are linked to the characteristics of the students who attend these schools. Specifically, students who come from low income backgrounds and from families who lack higher education are more likely to default on their loans, and data shows that students from proprietary schools are more likely to come from low income families and have parents who do not hold a college degree." The report went on to say that "student age was also linked to default rates in some of the research studies, with borrowers who take out student loans at an older age being more likely to default on their loans...because they tend to have other obligations besides paying for college. [The GAO] analysis of the Department of Education's data shows that proprietary schools serve a higher percentage of older students than public and private non-profit schools and the majority of students at proprietary schools are 25 years old and older."
44
Academic research further indicates that normalizing for demographics would eliminate the reported cohort default rate (CDR) gap with traditional institutions:
Herr and Burt (2005): "Individual student background characteristics outweighed school characteristics;"

45
Flint (1997): "Once one statistically controls for the kinds of students who attend proprietary schools, that effect    almost completely vanishes;" and
n
46
Jennie Woo (2002): "Institutional type only accounts for approximately 5% of the total contribution to increased    default for high-risk students. The remaining 95% is comprised of student risk factors."

Exhibit 13: Relative Contribution of Major Factors to the Higher Default Rates of Riskier Students
Source: NASFAA Journal of Student Financial Aid, Jennie Woo, Factors Affecting the Probability of Default: Student Loans in California, 2002.
Note: Baseline is white, female, U.S. citizen, high school graduate, father attended college, completed postsecondary education at a non-graduate or professional private four-year school, did not study business or computers, did not file for unemployment, and did not have a loan in deferment or forbearance, sold, rehabilitated, or repurchased, did not default on a prior loan, and had average family assets, family income, GPA, age, dependents, delinquency periods, current wages, and number of servicers; two-year college contribution calculated using a weighted average of two-year public, private, and proprietary and four-year public school change in probabilities.
 
Perhaps equally important, the official CDR, as reported by the U.S. Department of Education, is a measure of default incidence, not a measure of dollar default. Students who drop out drive CDRs, and based on our experience at University of Phoenix, drop-outs have lower average debt levels since those who drop tend to do so early in their programs. This is not an excuse or reason to manage an institution of higher learning with unacceptably high default rates, but we believe the early drop-outs represent well intentioned students who begin their program and quickly realize that they cannot meet the strict obligations we require to successfully complete one of our programs given their work or family obligations which can sometimes be overwhelming. University of Phoenix students' two-year default rate for the 2008 cohort is estimated to be just 6.7% on a dollar-based calculation.
As a result, the dollar-value default percentage (the true economic impact of defaults) is significantly lower than the incidence-of-default percentage at University of Phoenix.

Are Proprietary Institutions a Good Investment for Taxpayers?
Beyond the general societal benefits of education, which include a more productive and competitive workforce, lower unemployment rates and more stable communitiesproprietary institutions educate citizens more cost effectively than traditional institutions.
Despite the fact that socioeconomic and other risk-factors impact the average amount of financial aid borrowed by non-traditional students and also the rate at which non-traditional students default on that debt, it is important to note that proprietary institutions do not burden the taxpayer as much as traditional publicly funded or independent private universities.
Yes, it is true that the taxpayer must bear the losses on defaulted Title IV loans, but according to the recent budget submitted by the White House, After accounting for collection costs and unaccrued interest, we estimate the net recovery rate ranges between 60-65%.
the Department of Education recovers more than 100% of the principal amount on defaulted loans to students through the federal Title IV programs.
49
The costs of student loans are further offset by corporate income taxes paid by proprietary institutions. Therefore, it's hard to imagine that proprietary institutions of higher learning are producing huge financial liabilities for taxpayers as suggested by critics of the sector. In fact, as they do not receive direct state subsidies and do not benefit from tax-free endowment contributions, but rather they pay significant taxes back to the public coffers.
proprietary institutions cost the taxpayers significantly less than traditional schools,
We have undertaken an extensive analysis (detailed below) based on publicly available sources to understand the relative cost to the taxpayer to educate students at various types of postsecondary institutions. We calculate the net cost to society, inclusive of defaults on student loans, is approximately $1,509 per student per academic year at University of Phoenix compared with a cost of $7,051 per student at independent private institutions and $11,340 per student at public institutions.

Exhibit 14: Annual Per Student Taxpayer Costs by Institution Type
Source: Apollo Group analysis.
Notes:
     Analysis includes all U.S, degree granting institutions that are eligible for Title IV.
Institutions:
      Information obtained from IPEDS for all schools as reported under the IPEDS definition for Fall 2008 full-time equivalent students.
Student Enrollment Data:
     Information obtained from IPEDS for GASB institutions and private non-profit institutions or public institutions using FASB includes federal/state/local government operating contracts and appropriations (Pell awards included). Information obtained from IPEDS for FASB proprietary institutions includes state/local government grants and federal/state/local government appropriations (Pell awards excluded). Pell award information for FASB proprietary institutions was obtained from the Department of Education website.
Direct Government Support:
     Subsidized Title IV loan information obtained from the Department of Education website. The three month Treasury bill rate was used assuming a one year interest subsidy for amounts loaned.
Interest on Subsidized Loans:
     Assumes that although more than 100% is collected on average for each Title IV dollar loaned by the government, the government could earn the equivalent amount of interest through the issuance of treasury bills. In addition, data is not available to determine if interest repayment trends are different between institutional types. However, lifetime default rates vary significantly between institutional types. The lifetime budgeted default rates for the 2007 cohort of students, per a report by the Department of Education issued in December 2009, along with 2007 two year cohort default rates, also published by the Department of Education, were used to determine expected default rates by institutional type.
Loan Defaults:
     The lifetime budgeted default rates of 17.2% used for the public and private non-profit institutions is based on an average of four-year freshman  senior rates.
Public and Private Non-Profit:
     The lifetime budgeted default rate of 39.5% used for the proprietary institutions is based on the two-year proprietary institutions lifetime budgeted default rate. The two-year proprietary institutions lifetime budgeted default rate of 47% was weighted at 20% based on the number of full-time equivalent students in the two-year category as a percentage of the total in the proprietary institutions. The four-year proprietary institutions rate was determined based on the relationship of the four-year proprietary institutions 2007 cohort default rate of 9.8% as compared to the two-year proprietary institutions rate of approximately 12.25% and applying this ratio to the two-year proprietary institutions lifetime budgeted default rate of 47%. This rate for the expected four-year proprietary institutions lifetime budgeted default rate was then weighted at 80% based on the number of full-time equivalent students in the four-year category as a percentage of the total in the proprietary institutions.
Proprietary:
     The recovery rate used for defaulted loans is the same for all institutions, 60.6%. This was then multiplied by the defaulted loans total to get the recovery dollar amount. The recovery rate was calculated using information from the Department of Education - - SFA Collections, The White House  Office of Management and Budget ("The President's Budget 2009"), student loan collection industry's collection fees, and Apollo Group estimates.
Recovery on Loans:
     Public and private non-profit institutions adjusted for the estimated tax benefit that donors receive for the gifts at a 35% tax rate. The gift amounts were obtained from IPEDS.
Donor Tax Benefit:
     Credit given to proprietary institutions for sales and use tax paid based on total revenue as reported in IPEDS to make comparable to public and private non-profit institutions.
Sales & Other Taxes:
     Credit given to proprietary institutions for corporate taxes based on net income as reported in IPEDS to make comparable to public and private non-profit institutions.
Taxes on Corporate Profits:
We note that this analysis is based on the most current, independent third-party data available to us (much of which comes directly from the Department of Education), and we believe it to be the most reasonable case scenario for the relative per student costs to taxpayers. Importantly, however, we would also direct readers to a recent study by Delta Cost Project which reported comparable figures to our calculation for subsidies at public institutions ($10,267 for federal, state and local appropriations, grants and contracts at public community colleges and $10,302 for federal, state and local appropriations, grants and contracts at public master's institutions), which most closely relates to the Direct Government Support line item for public institutions in our analysis above. The similarity of our figures to other third-party studies provides us with greater comfort with the reasonableness of our figures.

Can America Meet Its Educational Goals Without Proprietary Institutions?
(including five million community college graduates) by 2020 according to the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems. The following graph shows the cumulative growth needed by state over the next 10 years to reach that goal.
Meeting President Obama's national graduation goals would require an
additional 13.1 million
college graduates
52
Exhibit 15: Number of Additional Graduates Needed per State by 2020 to Meet President Obama's National Education Goals

Furthermore, since not all students who start a degree program complete it, the system will need to accommodate tens of millions of additional new students in order to yield the incremental 13.1 million graduates. At a time when states are having difficulty even maintaining budgetary resources for higher education and are cutting both faculty positions and student enrollment capacity, how can states afford to educate tens of millions of additional students and produce 13.1 million additional college graduates?
Using our previously discussed per student cost to the taxpayer estimate for public institutions of $11,340 (see Exhibit 14) and publicly available graduation rates, we estimate an additional five million community college graduates will cost the American taxpayer $214 billion over the next 10 years. In addition, we estimate an incremental 8.1 million four-year college graduates will cost the American taxpayer $520 billion over the next 10 years. (And neither of these figures includes the capital spending to construct new classrooms and schools, nor cost increases at all over that 10-year period.)
53
In total, we estimate the cost to the U.S. taxpayer to educate the additional 13.1 million graduates necessary to meet the President's American Graduation Initiative utilizing public institutions would be an additional $734 billion in federal, state and local support over the next decade (assuming no cost increases). More realistically, assuming just 2% annual cost increases, we estimate the cost to the U.S. taxpayer would be
more than $800 billion
over the next decade.
 
Exhibit 16: Cost to Government of President Obama's American Graduation Initiative
Using Only Public Schools
Source: Apollo Group analysis.
 
Using this same framework, but assuming our previously discussed per student cost to the taxpayer estimate for proprietary institutions of $4,519 (see Exhibit 14), we estimate the comparable cost to the taxpayer to meet the President's American Graduation Initiative with proprietary institutions would be $293 billion in 2008 dollars (assuming no cost increases) or $327 billion assuming just 2% annual cost increases. And as noted previously, the per student cost to the taxpayer of $1,509 for University of Phoenix (see Exhibit 14) is lower than the proprietary institution average.
Thus, meeting the goal of educating an additional 13.1 million graduates through proprietary institutions instead of public institutions could
save
taxpayers nearly $500 billion dollars over the next ten years (assuming 2% annual cost increases).
Accredited, degree-granting proprietary colleges and universities serving non-traditional students, alongside the traditional public and private independent institutions, are essential to expanding capacity within the higher education system and meeting President Obama's goal of having the largest percentage of college graduates in the world by 2020.

Aligning Our Educational Offerings with the Realities of Today's "Non-traditional" Students
Our students choose to attend University of Phoenix because our learning model and our educational offering is tailored to the unique educational needs of today's working learner.
The majority of University of Phoenix students are working, or actively looking for work. If these students attended school full time at a community college or state university, it would mean a loss of income, which is simply not an option for most working adults who have rent or mortgage payments and are raising a family.
To help meet the needs of today's working learners, University of Phoenix offers:

Embracing Ethical Enrollment Practices
While advertising informs and drives interest, it alone does not drive enrollment. Today, the internet affords students the opportunity to do a tremendous amount of research about University of Phoenix and other institutions, enabling them to make more fully informed decisions about their educational options.
Enrollment costs at University of Phoenix are generally in-line with those of other institutions. The average cost to enroll a new student at University of Phoenix was $2,606 in fiscal 2008 compared with $2,383 for all colleges and universities (which excludes certain promotional efforts used by traditional schools, such as athletic programs that can cost as much as $100 million annually). More specifically, the average marketing and advertising spend per new enrollment at University of Phoenix was $1,127 in

Exhibit 17: Average Marketing Spend per New Enrollment

We believe that ethical advertising serves the purpose of informing students of the options they have in higher education. We view this as an important part of helping working learners, who may have both professional and family responsibilities, to understand that there is an option in higher education specifically designed to meet their needs. We also believe it is critically important for us, as a nation, to ensure that individuals who came from backgrounds in which they never thought they had an opportunity to go to college, individuals who for financial reasons had to start working or chose to join the military immediately after high school, or who simply did not appreciate the value of an education until later in life, recognize that there is a way for them to attain a college degree, and thus an opportunity to improve their position in life.
Purpose of Marketing is to Inform.
University of Phoenix is committed to delivering a high value education to those who are willing to work hard enough to realize its benefits. That means that while we are committed to our mission of providing access and opportunity, we do want to enroll students who we do not believe have a reasonable chance of succeeding at our institution. It does not benefit the student, and it does not benefit us. Students who drop out adversely impact important quality metrics such as cohort default rates and graduation rates for which we are accountable to our students and our regulators. Furthermore, from a purely economic standpoint, students who drop out tend to do so early in their programs at University of Phoenix, which adversely impacts us financially. It is not beneficial to us over the long term to enroll students who we do not believe will succeed.
That Being Said, Not Everyone is Prepared for College.
not
Recognizing that, over the past couple of years, we were seeing increasing numbers of students who were less prepared for college-level study, we began to develop certain initiatives to help deter unprepared or uninformed students from enrolling in our programs.
 
As a result, a portion of the cost of enrolling a student for University of Phoenix has gone to enhancing and developing sophisticated tools and data analytics that we can use to help students identify their likelihood of success.
Investing in More Sophisticated Evaluation Tools.
University Orientation provides prospective students with the opportunity to make sure college, and specifically University of Phoenix, is right for them without incurring any extra cost. It is a free, three-week non-credit bearing course that all students with less than 24 credit hours will be required to take. Recognizing that we were experiencing an increasing number of students who were less prepared for the rigors of our degree programs, in early 2009 University of Phoenix began testing and recently announced the planned implementation of this program which is designed to ensure that prospective students understand the time and commitment required to be successful in our degree programs before they enroll and, importantly, before they take on debt.
University Orientation.
After 18 months of testing and preparation with over 30,000 students having gone through our pilot, we plan to roll out this Orientation program to incoming students with fewer than 24 credit hours, as these are the students who have limited experience with college-level study. Based on the results of our Orientation pilot, . We are implementing this program because it is the right thing to do for our students.
all
approximately 20% of all prospective students going through the program opt out and do not enroll at University of Phoenix
In addition to the University Orientation program, in early 2009, we initiated a comprehensive review of how our counselors, who advise and enroll students, perform their duties and how they are evaluated and compensated. We have announced the planned rollout of a new evaluation and compensation structure for our counselors this fall that is consistent with our goal of focusing on the student and enhancing the student experience. We are committed to completely eliminating admission targets as a component of compensation for our counselors. Our primary goal is to ensure that students receive informative counseling and advice in a non-pressure environment to help them make wise decisions about their academic future.
Student-centric Advisors.
---
Implementing Enhanced Student Protections throughout the Student Experience
The University has proactively implemented several other initiatives focused on student protections and we will continue to add protections on an ongoing basis.
One tool that we use during the admissions process (in states where it's allowed) is our digital call recording system. This system monitors over 30,000 conversations per day between students and our admissions advisors and counselors for quality control and compliance purposes to help ensure we are interacting with current and prospective students in a manner that is consistent with our institutional policies and procedures.
Additionally during the admissions process, we strive to provide prospective students with accurate and informed advice with respect to their financial aid opportunities (and the corresponding obligations). To this end, while we cannot legally restrict the amount a student borrows under the Title IV funding program, we tested and implemented a Responsible Borrower Calculator in 2009, which teaches and encourages students to borrow only the amount they need for their education. Since the implementation of this new tool, the percentage of students who choose to borrow the maximum allowed has significantly declined. We estimate that the percentage of students who now choose to borrow the maximum amount of student financial aid allowed has dropped from approximately 90% to approximately 60-70%.
58
 
In addition to the Responsible Borrower Calculator, in the coming months we plan to roll out an enhanced, user-friendly tool, that will transparently show the total program costs (including tuition and fees) for any of our degree programs at any location, as well as any expected borrowing costs associated with student loans and the expected interest rates on those loans.
Beyond these student protections, we are also developing a pair of videos for students to view prior to enrolling, which we expect to roll out in the coming months. These videosone delivered during the admissions process that will reinforce the required time commitments and other information necessary for success in our programs, and the other delivered during the financial aid process that will explain the key components of financial aid, the importance of responsible borrowing, and repayment obligations on loansare intended to ensure that prospective students are fully informed prior to making an enrollment decision or taking on debt.
Finally, our focus on student protections does not stop once students are enrolled and attending classes. For example, during the past year we implemented a new self-service withdrawal process so that students do not feel pressured into remaining enrolled if they determine University of Phoenix is not right for them.

Offering a Quality Education that is Valued by Employers
University of Phoenix invests heavily in its students' education and student services, as well as the learning environment of tomorrow. Educational and instructional spending is by far our highest category of expenditure. In fiscal 2009, approximately 55% of our total expenses (or slightly higher when excluding the impact of certain litigation expenses) were direct educational and instructional costs. This compares to 48% for public institutions and 52% for all traditional institutions (public and independent private schools) for the 2006-2007 academic year (latest available), according to the Department of Education's 2009 Digest of Education Statistics.
Investments in Education.
59
60
We are able to invest significant resources in our students' education because we operate more efficiently by utilizing our classroom facilities nearly year round (whereas traditional schools often have unused facilities during summer and holiday breaks) and not spending our resources on dormitories, cafeterias, athletic complexes and other non-educational infrastructure that our students don't ask for and don't require.
Ultimately, the value of the education we deliver to our students is the determinant of the long-term success of our institution, as positive outcomes yield success for our graduates. Our University delivers value to its students and is one of the few institutions of higher learning in the country to transparently publish its outcomes, which we do in our Academic Annual Report.
61
For nearly 35 years, University of Phoenix has measured the learning outcomes of its students in order to verify what they've learned. University of Phoenix students typically enter with lower average assessment scores than the national average but substantially close that gap by their senior year, meaning they demonstrate similar levels of improvement through the course of their educational experience and even better improvement in the critical areas of English and mathematics compared with students from other schools. Improvement in MAPP Scores demonstrates our students' accomplishments.
Learning Outcomes.

Note: Master's Universities reference institutions that offer baccalaureate through graduate degrees.
As reported in University of Phoenix's 2009 Academic Annual Report, our associate students graduate at a slightly higher rate than the national average, and bachelor's students graduate below the national average owing, in part, to the greater numbers of risk factors (as defined by the Department of Education) that non-traditional students like ours exhibit.
Graduation Rates.

Exhibit 19: Completion Rates by Various Demographic Characteristics

Normalizing for these demographic differences in non-traditional students helps account for much of the observed differences in completion rates between proprietary and traditional schools. Despite the demographic challenges of our non-traditional student base, we are proud that
64
In addition, proprietary institution completion rates are substantially higher than community colleges, which have the most similar student mix based on demographics.
 
University of Phoenix produced approximately 90,000 graduates in the past year alone. With more than 500,000 alumni, our graduates are employed by thousands of companies and organizationslarge and small, including Fortune 500 companies and the White Housewithin a variety of industries and in various capacities, including entrepreneurs, senior level executives and CEOs.
Tuition increases have historically been in-line with those of other types of institutions. We estimate that annual tuition and fee increases at University of Phoenix have generally ranged between 4-6% (depending on degree program) over the past ten years compared with 7.6% at public four-year institutions, 4.4% at public two-year institutions, and 5.4% at independent private institutions according to the College Board.
Tuition and Student Debt.
65
Student debt levels at University of Phoenix are within national averages compared to both public and independent private four-year colleges and universities. For University of Phoenix, our bachelor's degree students (graduating between July 2007 and June 2008) had student loan debt on par with independent private four-year institutions. According to the College Board, in 2007-08, 28% of bachelor's degree students in independent private four-year institutions graduated with no debt, 48% graduated with less than $30,500 in debt, and 24% graduated with more than $30,500 in debt. During the same timeframe looking at federal debt incurred while attending University of Phoenix, 21% of our bachelor's degree recipients graduated with no debt, 56% graduated with less than $30,500 in debt, and 23% graduated with more than $30,500 in debt.
66
67
While default rates are a lagging indicator and are likely to go higher over the near term owing to the economic downturn of the last few years, as well as due to the significant growth in our associate student population in recent years, the draft 2008 2-year cohort default rate (CDR) for University of Phoenix students is 13.1% despite the demographic factors previously mentioned that place non-traditional students at a higher risk of default.
Default Rates.
CDRs for our associate students tend to be significantly higher than those of bachelor-level and graduate students, which, as mentioned, is expected to drive our reported rates up for the next couple of years. However, we believe our efforts to shift our student mix to bachelor's and higher-level students, as well as our new University Orientation program, will favorably impact our CDRs over time.
Interestingly, as noted earlier, the official CDR metric is a measure of default incidence, not a measure of dollar default. Students who drop out drive CDRs and drop-outs have lower debt levels as individuals who drop tend to do so early in their programs. As a result, two additional data points are worth noting. First, if we only look at students who have graduated with a University of Phoenix degree, we estimate our cumulative default rate is (using the official 2005, 2006 and 2007 cohort files). Second, the dollar value default percentage (the true economic impact of defaults) is about half of the incidence percentage. We estimate that the 2-year default rate on student loans for students at University of Phoenix in the 2008 cohort was just 6.7% on a dollar-basis calculation, despite one of the worst economic recessions in modern history. Importantly, we expect our University Orientation program to significantly reduce the number of students who drop out early in a given program, which we would expect over time to improve the relatively lower dollar loan default rates.

Investing in the Future of Higher Learning
Now that we've discussed our learning model as it stands today, we want to highlight some of the substantial investments we've been making into the future of learning at the college level. While being a for-profit entity in higher education generates some criticism, and in some cases rightfully so when profit motives drive bad behavior, one undeniable benefit is the fact that profits often drive innovation in a free market society. We are living proof of this at Apollo Group, as we helped pioneer education for the working learner over 35 years ago, and we have always been committed to the use of technology innovation and advances in information systems to improve the access to and outcomes of education for our students. Like so many industries that have leveraged technology advances to enhance product, service and productivity, we have invested significantly in the use of technology to increase our students' learning experience and to expand the accessibility of education to working learners in general.
We are currently investing hundreds of millions of dollars in research, development, information systems, networking infrastructure and data centers. We are making advances in the field of adaptive learning in order to personalize education so that every individualno matter what their learning stylecan have a chance at a successful education. We strive to create a system that learns with each student and adapts the way in which it delivers curriculum to maximize the learning experience. We are investing in the most current community and networking technologies, so that we can connect our students, faculty and alumni into learning communities across the country and the globe in order to create an environment from diverse communities and gain access to the most relevant and highest quality information wherever it may physically reside. Importantly, our advancements in distance learning enable a larger pool of faculty and knowledge workers to bring their skills and techniques in every critical field of the economy to a global audience of students.
 
We imagine a future in which learning can happen at any moment in whatever format or modality an individual needs to be successful, whether it is listening to downloads on their commute to work on a smart phone or in a traditional classroom. We believe in a world in which the most relevant information and the most engaging learning experiences inspire millions of citizens to pursue an education in an environment that instills confidence and accomplishment and empowers teachers and innovators to invest in learning.
Over the long term, we hope that by integrating technology effectively with innovations in learning, we can make substantial breakthroughs in the future of education.

Recognizing the Importance of Regulatory Compliance
Apollo Group believes that effective regulatory oversight is critical to the postsecondary system for both traditional and proprietary institutions, and we strive to be leaders in regulatory compliance.
At the most fundamental level, our institutions' policies, procedures, actions and outcomes are reviewed and scrutinized by a regulatory triad consisting of (1) federal agency and federal law, (2) multiple state regulatory authorities, and (3) regional and various programmatic accrediting bodies to help ensure quality educational outcomes, effective student protections, and responsible stewardship of Title IV funding. These are objectives that we share with those charged with overseeing the postsecondary system in this country.
At the federal level, the U.S. Department of Education, as authorized by Congress through the Higher Education Act and subsequent reauthorizations, has conducted numerous program reviews and audits of University of Phoenix over its 35 year history and has, after extensive periodic reviews, fully recertified the University's eligibility to participate in student financial aid programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Additionally, the University is required to submit annual student financial aid compliance audits conducted by an independent accounting firm and continuously abide by the terms of our Program Participation Agreement.
In addition, we are subject to numerous state-level regulatory visits, reviews, license renewals, and various other criteria depending on the state. University of Phoenix has been approved or has authorization to operate in 43 states and currently does so in 40 of them.
Lastly, University of Phoenix has achieved regional accreditation from the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schoolsone of six accrediting bodies considered to be the gold standard of accreditationin 1978 and has been subsequently reaffirmed five times based on thorough reviews and site visitations from academicians at peer institutions charged with scrutinizing our academic quality and student learning outcomes. In addition, several of our degree programs are accredited by programmatic accrediting bodies, including our teaching, nursing, counseling and business programs:

We take our responsibility to our regulators, and ultimately to students, seriously, and while we will never rest, we have initiated a rigorous process designed to improve oversight of our policies and procedures. Earlier this year, we hired a new Chief Compliance Officer, who has
 
more than a decade of experience in senior leadership roles specific to ethics and compliance, to ensure that the policies and procedures we have in place with respect to the interaction of our employees, faculty and staff with prospective and current students and our handling of student funds is fully compliant with the law and our regulators' directives.
Furthermore, we have an internal team dedicated to identifying cases of potential fraud, and have self-reported numerous instances of suspected fraud and abuse to the U.S. Department of Education Office of Inspector General for them to further pursue investigations and take legal action when appropriate.
Some critics of the proprietary sector have recently pointed to specific instances of inaccurate or misleading interactions with prospective students as the basis of claiming a culture of aggressive sales tactics and inappropriate behavior at certain institutions. While we cannot think of a company or government entity that has zero errors in the area of compliance, noncompliance is neither acceptable nor permitted at any of our universities. There are clear consequences for breaches of compliance. To that end, we have instituted comprehensive compliance training and control processes within our institutions. When we discover instances of impropriety, they are dealt with quickly and fullyup to, and including, termination.
Our intent is to ensure that our employees understand and act on both the letter and the spirit of the law and the many regulations that are already in place through the regulatory triad. Simply, we ask our employees to always comply with policies and procedures and do the right thing for the student. We are committed to fostering a culture within the organization, advocated and supported by our senior leaders, that aligns our policies and procedures with the goal of creating a world-class student experience at each of our universities.

What is Management's Philosophy?
Apollo Group is proud of its record of positive student outcomes and our leadership in the field of higher education with respect to the transparency of those outcomes, as demonstrated through the publication of our 2008 and 2009 Academic Annual Reports.
It does mean that we do not need to ask the taxpayer to directly subsidize our operations beyond the usage of federal loans and grants for which our students qualify (using the same criteria that students of all institutions use to qualify).
Importantly, while we are a publicly traded company with shareholders, for us
"for-profit"
does not mean
"profits before students."
Internally, our senior leaders have explicitly directed faculty, advisors and staff that they must always be of the mindset of doing the right thing for the student; treat each student as if he or she were a close friend or family member; and if something does not seem right, elevate that concern until the concern is resolved. Externally, management has expressed this philosophy to our shareholders so that they can understand how our leadership team operates University of Phoenix and our other institutions. We believe this philosophy is borne out not just by our words, but more importantly by our actions, including responsible enrollment practices, student protections, and performance management systems to reward the right behaviors.
Our management philosophy is, first and foremost, to always do what is right for the student.
Ultimately, our shareholders can only realize sustainable returns on their investment if we consistently provide a strong value proposition to our students.
 
Conclusion
In today's world we need on-demand, rapidly deployed, effective education. Today's working learners need industry-adaptive faculty and curriculumfaculty who are active in their fields of instruction and teach curriculum that can immediately be applied in the workforce. Educational programs need to prepare students for today's economy, not the economy of the past. We believe that University of Phoenix through our technological investment, advanced learning methodologies, and our national reach can dramatically accelerate the innovation that is essential to transform education in America.
The U.S. higher education system must evolve from one that caters to a small, selective elite to one that also produces a broadly educated society in order for the U.S. to remain competitive in today's global, knowledge-based economy.
While an important part of the higher education system, traditional colleges and universities cannot meet the Obama administration's national education goals alone.
University of Phoenix's mission is to provide access to high-quality education through innovation and by delivering consistent, valuable learning outcomes.
By providing an accessible, high quality education, University of Phoenix is producing successful outcomes-graduates who are better positioned to enjoy the professional, financial and personal benefits that a degree brings, as well as a more educated, competitive society as a whole.
Through a framework of thoughtful and consistent regulation, well managed proprietary colleges and universitiesthose that are committed to responsible, ethical practices and regulatory complianceplay a vital role in the future of America's higher education system, helping it to rise to the challenge of meeting the needs of the millions of non-traditional learners and producing the graduates necessary to achieve the nation's shared educational and economic goals. Apollo Group is committed to leading the nation towards this future.

Exhibit 99.1
Phoenix, October 13, 2010  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or the "Company") today reported financial results for the three months and fiscal year ended August 31, 2010.
"Fiscal 2010 has been a year of significant progress at Apollo Group, as we have been completing the development of numerous strategic initiatives that are being implemented over the coming year," said Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer and Apollo Global Chairman Greg Cappelli. "These initiatives, which are designed to enhance the student experience, expand student protections and ensure that we enroll students who we believe, have a greater likelihood to succeed in our programs. These initiatives will present new challenges for the Company in the year ahead, but they are the right things to do for our students and they will better position us to succeed as an organization over the longer term."
Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer Chas Edelstein added, "We agree with the stated goal of the Department of Education and of Congress to ensure that students in the postsecondary education system receive a quality education at a good value. We have taken and intend to continue to take a leadership role within the proprietary sector by providing students with a good value for their educational investment while employing marketing practices that fully and fairly inform our students about the educational options available to them, as well as the costs and potential benefits of an education."
Unaudited Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2010 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 totaled $1,259.4 million, which represents a 17.4% increase over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Contributing to the growth in the fourth quarter was a 6.3% year-over-year increase in University of Phoenix total Degreed Enrollment to 470,800, as well as an increase of $20.5 million in net revenue from BPP Holdings, which was acquired on July 30, 2009. The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended August 31, 2010, of $47.5 million, or $0.32 per share (148.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $97.2 million, or $0.62 per share (155.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended August 31, 2009.
Results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 contain special items that include goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $175.9 million for the BPP subsidiary of Apollo Global ($150.5 million net of non-controlling interests) and a $0.9 million charge representing an accrual for incremental post-judgment interest related to a securities class action lawsuit. The
1
 
Company did not record a tax benefit associated with the goodwill impairment, as it is not deductible for tax purposes. The fiscal 2009 fourth quarter results included special items totaling $95.4 million pre-tax, as well as a discrete charge to the income tax provision of $4.7 million. The special items included an accrual for an estimated litigation settlement of $80.5 million, a $9.4 million write-off of information technology fixed assets that resulted primarily from the Company's rationalization of software, and a $5.5 million charge, net of non-controlling interests, representing the option premium for a currency hedge in connection with Apollo Global's acquisition of BPP.
Excluding these special items, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended August 31, 2010, was $193.9 million, or $1.31 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $171.3 million, or $1.10 per share for the three months ended August 31, 2009. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, BPP's operations contributed $33.6 million to net revenue compared with $13.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 following the July 30, 2009, acquisition of BPP. BPP's results diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group by approximately $0.15 excluding the goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 ($1.13 including the impairment charges) compared with a decrease of $0.03 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. (See the supplemental schedule detailing BPP's financial results in the tables section of this press release.)
Instructional costs and services increased by $104.0 million, or 23.4% to $547.7 million for the three months ended August 31, 2010, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2009. As a percentage of revenue, instructional costs and services increased 220 basis points to 43.5% versus 41.3% in the prior year's fourth quarter. The increase, as a percentage of revenue, was primarily due to the addition of BPP, as its cost structure is more heavily weighted towards instructional costs and services, as well as higher bad debt expense for University of Phoenix, partially offset by the reversal of a $5.0 million accrual which was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2010, related to a state grant program. Bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenue, increased 170 basis points to 5.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 versus 4.2% in the prior year's fourth quarter. The higher bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenue, is a result of the economic downturn and increases in receivables from undergraduate students entering with less than 24 credits. Collection rates for these students are generally lower compared to students with more college experience or those enrolled in graduate level programs.
Selling and promotional expenses increased by $40.9 million, or 15.7%, to $301.6 million for the three months ended August 31, 2010, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2009. As a percentage of revenue, selling and promotional expenses declined 40 basis points to 23.9% versus 24.3% in the prior year's fourth quarter. The decrease, as a percentage of revenue, was a result of slower hiring of enrollment advisors, partially offset by higher advertising expenditures directed at bachelor degree and graduate degree level programs at University of Phoenix. BPP's operations had little impact on selling and promotional expenses as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.
2
 
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses increased by $2.7 million, or 3.1%, to $91.0 million, for the three months ended August 31, 2010, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2009. As a percentage of revenue, G&A expenses declined 100 basis points to 7.2% versus 8.2% in the prior year's fourth quarter. The decrease, as a percentage of revenue, is primarily attributable to a $9.4 million fixed asset write-off noted as a special item in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. BPP's operations had little impact on G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.

2010 Fiscal Year End Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2010, was $4.9 billion, a 24.6% increase over fiscal 2009. Contributing to this increase was a 13.1% increase in University of Phoenix's average Degreed Enrollment for fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009. The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $568.4 million, or $3.72 per share, (152.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2010, compared to $614.7 million, or $3.85 per share, (159.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2009.
Results for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2010, contain special items that include goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $184.6 million for the BPP and Universidad Latinoamericana ("ULA") subsidiaries of Apollo Global ($158.0 million net of non-controlling interests) and $178.0 million in charges related to a securities class action lawsuit, as well as a tax benefit of $11.4 million resulting from the settlement for disputed tax issues with the Internal Revenue Service. The Company did not record a tax benefit associated with the goodwill impairment charges, as they are not deductible for tax purposes. Results for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2009, included special items totaling $95.4 million pre-tax, as well as a discrete charge to the income tax provision of $4.7 million. The special items included an accrual for an estimated litigation settlement of $80.5 million, a $9.4 million write-off of information technology fixed assets that resulted primarily from the Company's rationalization of software, and a $5.5 million charge, net of non-controlling interests, representing the option premium for a currency hedge in connection with Apollo Global's acquisition of BPP.
Excluding these special items, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2010, was $817.7 million, or $5.35 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $688.8 million, or $4.32 per share for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2009. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of August 31, 2010, the Company's cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $1,284.8 million as compared to $968.2 million as of August 31, 2009. The increase is primarily attributable to cash generated from operations, partially offset by share repurchases, capital expenditures, and an increase in restricted cash. Restricted cash and cash equivalents (including long-term) increased by $138.4 million compared to August 31, 2009, primarily due to funds used to collateralize a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $126 million in connection with a program review of University of Phoenix by the U.S. Department of Education, as well as increased student deposits at University of Phoenix.
At August 31, 2010, accounts receivable decreased to $264.4 million from $298.3 million at August 31, 2009. Excluding accounts receivable and the associated net revenue for Apollo Global, the Company's days sales outstanding ("DSO") was 30 days at August 31, 2010, compared to 32 days at August 31, 2009. The decrease in DSO versus a year ago is primarily attributable to a more pronounced seasonal increase in accounts receivable at August 31, 2009, due to University of Phoenix annual student financial aid system enhancements and upgrades.
5
 
Total debt outstanding (including short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt) decreased by $4.7 million to $584.4 million at August 31, 2010, from $589.1 million at August 31, 2009. Subsequent to August 31, 2010, the Company repaid approximately $400 million of the outstanding balance.
Share Repurchases
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company repurchased approximately 2.0 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $49.76 per share for a total expenditure of $100.0 million. As of August 31, 2010, approximately $561 million remained available under the Company's current share repurchase authorization.
Business Outlook
The Company expects fiscal 2011 to be a year of continuing transition in its operations as it implements initiatives, primarily at University of Phoenix, aimed at enhancing the student experience, expanding student protections and shifting the mix of enrollment to more experienced students who have a greater likelihood of succeeding in the Company's programs. Some of these initiatives include:
The Company expects that the implementation of these initiatives, together with the effect of other challenges the proprietary education industry is facing will adversely impact its operating metrics and financial results. Some of the industry challenges include ongoing regulatory and other scrutiny which has led to heightened media attention, much of which has portrayed the sector in an unflattering light. Given the transitional state of the business, and the uncertain regulatory environment, the Company is withdrawing its prior preliminary business outlook for fiscal 2011. However, the Company provides the following commentary:

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
This press release and the related conference call contain non-GAAP financial measures, which are intended to supplement, but not substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Management uses, and chooses to disclose to investors, these non-GAAP financial measures because (i) such measures provide an additional analytical tool to clarify the Company's results from operations and help to identify underlying trends in its results of operations; (ii) as to the non-GAAP earnings measures, such measures help compare the Company's performance on a consistent basis across time periods; and (iii) these non-GAAP measures are employed by the Company's management in its own evaluation of performance and are utilized in financial and operational decision-making processes, such as budgeting and forecasting. Exclusion of items in our non-GAAP presentation should not be construed as an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Other companies, including other companies in the education industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure across companies.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
     (e) Material Compensatory Plan, Contract or Arrangement.
     1.  On November 23, 2010, the Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors of Apollo Group, Inc. (the "Company") approved an amendment to the Company's Executive Officer Incentive Bonus Plan (the "Plan"), pursuant to which additional performance criteria were added to the Plan upon which specific target levels of attainment can be established by the Compensation Committee as a condition to bonus payments under the Plan. The additional performance goals are as follows: (i) measures of student academic success, (ii) measures of student satisfaction at one or more of the Company's universities or throughout the Company's university system as a whole, (iii) measures of faculty performance or levels of faculty engagement at one or more of the Company's universities or throughout the Company's university system as a whole, and (iv) measures of enhanced student service at one or more of the Company's universities or throughout the Company's university system as a whole.
Amendment of Executive Officer Incentive Bonus Plan.
     The amendment is subject to the approval of the holders of the Company's Class B Common Stock, the only outstanding voting securities of the Company.
     2.  On November 23, 2010, the Compensation Committee also approved the 2011 fiscal year bonus plan under the Executive Officer Incentive Bonus Plan (the "2011 Plan"). The key features of the 2011 Plan may be summarized as follows:
Approval of 2011 Fiscal Year Executive Officer Bonus Plan.
     All of the Company's executive officers will be eligible to participate in the 2011 Plan, including the following individuals, who are the named executive officers in the Company's Information Statement dated December 30, 2010 and filed on Schedule 14C with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 29, 2009:
Participants.
     For Dr. Sperling and Messrs. Edelstein, Cappelli and D'Amico, the target bonus opportunity was set at 100% of annual base salary, and for Messrs. Swartz and Wrubel, the target bonus was set at 75%.
     . The Compensation Committee established five separate performance goals under the 2011 Plan.
Performance Goals
          - The first goal, weighted forty percent (40%) for purposes of determining the potential cash incentive amount for each participant, will be tied to the Company's operating income for the first three quarters of the 2011 fiscal year. The Company's operating income for such period will be determined in accordance with GAAP on a consolidated basis but will be subject to certain pre-established exclusions and adjustments. Specific levels of operating income at threshold, target and maximum levels will be set by the Compensation Committee.
 
          - The second performance goal, weighted fifteen percent (15%), will be tied to the level of student academic success and will be measured in terms of the percentage of students who first enroll in a University of Phoenix ("UOPX") course at any time during the first two quarters of the 2011 fiscal year and subsequently earn at least one unit of academic credit. Specific percentages will be set by the Compensation Committee for the threshold, target and maximum levels of attainment.
          - The third performance goal, weighted fifteen percent (15%), will be measured in terms of an independently-conducted survey of UOPX students addressing a particular measure of student satisfaction. Goal attainment will be measured in terms of the percentage of responding UOPX students who score the measured item favorably, and specific percentages have been set for the threshold, target and maximum levels of attainment.
          - The fourth performance goal, weighted fifteen percent (15%), will be measured in terms of an independently-conducted survey addressing four particular measures of UOPX faculty engagement at the Company's universities. Goal attainment will be measured in terms of the percentage of responding UOPX faculty members who score the measured items favorably, with the percentage of favorable responses received for each item to be combined and the combined percentage to be measured against the threshold, target and maximum levels of attainment set by the Committee.
          - The fifth and final performance goal, weighted fifteen percent (15%), will be measured in terms of the improvement made by the individual UOPX campuses in (i) responding to student concerns on a timely basis at the campus point of origin and (ii) responding on a timely basis to external agents or agencies addressing individual student concerns and complaints. Specific levels of attainment have been set for threshold, target and maximum levels.
     The potential cash incentive payable to each participant will be based on the actual attained level of each performance goal. Accordingly, the percentage of the target bonus amount assigned to each performance goal will be multiplied by the applicable factor (ranging from 0.5 at threshold to 2.0 at maximum level attainment). Should a performance goal be attained at a level between threshold and target or between target and maximum, then the applicable factor for the calculation of the potential cash incentive attributable to that performance goal shall be interpolated between those two levels on a straight linear basis.
Potential Cash Incentive Payment.
     The portion of the cash incentive payment calculated for each participant on the basis of the attained levels of the operating-income and student-academic-success goals may be reduced by the Compensation Committee by up to 20% in the event the Committee determines that such a reduction is warranted based on its overall assessment of Company and individual performance.
Actual Cash Incentive Payment.
     The portion of the actual bonus attributable to the operating-income and the student-academic-success goals will be paid during the month of June 2011 to each participant who continues in the Company's employ through the end of the third quarter of the 2011 fiscal year. The portion of the actual bonus attributable to the remaining performance goals will be paid to each participant who continues in the Company's employ through the end of the 2011 fiscal year. However, in either instance, pro-rated bonuses will be paid to participants who do not complete the applicable service requirement by reason of death or disability.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
December 9, 2010
PHOENIX, December 9, 2010  University of Phoenix, the flagship university of Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:APOL), today announced key findings from its third Academic Annual Report, highlighting a commitment to higher education fueled by constant innovation and ongoing efforts to improve the learning experience through advanced technology. University of Phoenix has been driving innovation in higher education for more than 30 years, and has consistently worked to build degree programs that directly address the shifting economic and academic challenges faced by working learners.
"At University of Phoenix we are always listening and looking for ways to better serve our students and ensure their success, both in the classroom and beyond," said Dr. William J. Pepicello, president of University of Phoenix. "For years we've been a key player in educational innovation and reinforce this tradition with our Academic Annual Report. This Report serves as a milestone as we continue to innovate and evolve to better enable students to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to achieve their professional goals, improve the productivity of their organizations, and provide leadership and service to their communities."
Key Findings

Continuous Improvement
To address the skills necessary to be successful at University of Phoenix and to try to assist prospective students in making an informed decision about whether to invest their time, money, and effort, a new student orientation program was recently developed. University Orientation, a three-week, non-credit bearing, free orientation workshop required for all students entering with fewer than 24 credits prior to their enrollment with the University, was tested during much of 2010 with a small sub-set of the University's student population.
The beta test of the new University Orientation program was rolled out to approximately 30,000 students. The results of that beta group show that approximately 80 percent of the students who start the University Orientation finish it. The retention rates after the first few courses for those who complete University Orientation are higher than those for students who do not go through the program. The increase in this initial retention rate suggests that program completion rates may eventually improve, which is one of the goals of University Orientation.
Comparisons
In general, this year's results are similar to those reported in the last two Academic Annual Reports (, ). In the area of student satisfaction, the results are essentially the same as in 2009, with students rating all categories high. Student and faculty diversity in ethnicity and gender remain similar to last year, although the percentage of female faculty at University of Phoenix did rise from 49 percent in 2009 to almost 54 percent this year.
2008
2009
In the area of information literacy, results indicate that most scores for seniors compare favorably or the same in benchmark comparisons to students at other similar institutions. The general education knowledge and skills of freshmen and seniors were roughly equivalent to the scores of freshmen and seniors from last year.
The completion rates for the University show a slight decline in the percentage of students graduating in 150 percent of the traditional time to degree completion. The University believes
3
 
that most of these changes arise from difficulties associated with current economic conditions and may improve over time with the implementation of University Orientation.
"While our student satisfaction rates remain high, the University is closely examining all year-over-year comparisons to determine where there is room for improvement," said Pepicello. "As a result we have already implemented measures which we believe over time will result in more students completing their degrees in a timely manner."
"Our University is committed to educating the right kind of student, the student that is prepared to take on the challenges of obtaining a higher education degree," said Pepicello. "With the addition of University Orientation prior to enrollment, prospective students gain a better understanding of the time commitments required for university-level study and how it will or will not fit into their busy lives."
The University believes that the results of the new student orientation, although somewhat preliminary in nature, show that students are benefiting from the new program. It is hoped that the increase in course completion by students who have successfully completed the new orientation will continue and result in increased persistence throughout the students' degree programs.

Exhibit 99.2
 
The 2010 University of Phoenix Academic Annual Report addresses the issue of academic quality and discusses why it appears to be difficult to define, measure, and deliver. Academic quality, always the mainstay of education, has become more important than ever as we endeavor to return the United States to a global leadership role in education.
Never before have students, governments, and taxpayers clamored so loudly for increased accountability and transparency in education. The call is coming from all sides to show the links between the classroom, academic quality, and success in the workplace. While the impatience grows, the difficulty defining academic quality and appropriate metrics for a changing educational and work landscape continues.
Today's economics demand that more significant numbers of people continue their education to complete a degree, to repurpose careers, or to stay current with technology and changes in the professions. For quite some time, the traditional residential student going directly from high school to college has been the exception rather than the rule. As a result of the needs of the new majority, and because technology has advanced to a point that anyone can attend class at any time and almost anywhere, delivery methods have evolved and determining the appropriate metrics to measure quality have yet to be defined.
The University of Phoenix has determined that academic quality must be discussed from two perspectives: as a measure of internal integrity in which key indicators that tie academic outcomes to student success are a part of a system of continuous improvement, and as a set of measures by which institutions can be compared in regard to student achievement. The University has identified curriculum, assessment of student learning outcomes, and faculty preparation as basic to the enterprise. These elements must be continually improved as part of the internal integrity process that defines academic quality and results in student achievement that can be compared externally. How the University accomplishes this is discussed in detail in the report that follows.
In the second section of the 2010 Academic Annual Report, the University reviews student performance on a series of internal and external metrics. These include the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE), the Standardized Assessment of Information Literacy Skills, and the ETS Proficiency Profile (EPP). The latter was previously known as the Measure of Academic Proficiency and Progression (MAPP). The assessment remains the same; the name is the only change.
In general, there is congruency in results this year as compared to the last two Academic Annual Reports. The completion rates for the University show a slight decline this year. The University believes that most of these changes arise from difficulties associated with current economic conditions.
Finally, the Report reviews the initiatives announced in last year's report the University Orientation, the First-Year Sequence, and Just-In-Time remediation through the University's Centers for Writing and Mathematics Excellence. Going forward, the University continues to make data-driven decisions on how best to continually improve its systems and curriculum in ways that will best benefit our students.

University of Phoenix (UOPX) was founded on an agenda of social responsibility to provide educational access to underserved populations. This agenda has served the University and its students well, and the policies underpinning that agenda have become an integral part of the culture of University of Phoenix.
Over the last three decades, University of Phoenix has worked to build an institution with the agility to directly address the shifting economic and academic challenges that working adults face. The University's growth over the last thirty years has been fueled by constant innovation and ongoing efforts to improve the learning experience through advanced technology.
University of Phoenix has evolved to meet the changing needs of students and employers. Today the University is a comprehensive learning institution enrolling 470,800 students, with a faculty of more than 32,000 and nearly 600,000 alumni.
In this, the third Academic Annual Report issued, the University analyzes academic quality in higher education and attempts to answer why quality is so difficult to define and ensure. In the second half, the report reviews the Academic Scorecard for University of Phoenix students.
Mission and Purposes
The Mission of University of Phoenix is to provide access to higher education opportunities that enable students to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to achieve their professional goals, improve the productivity of their organization, and provide leadership and service to their communities.
1. To facilitate cognitive and affective student learning, knowledge, skills and values, and to promote use of that knowledge in the student's workplace.
2. To develop competence in communication, critical thinking, collaboration, and information utilization, together with the commitment to lifelong learning for enhancement of students' opportunities for career success.
3. To provide instruction that bridges the gap between theory and practice through faculty members who bring to their classroom not only advanced academic preparation, but also the skills that come from the current practice of their professions.
4. To provide General Education and foundational instruction and services that prepare students to engage in a variety of university curricula.
5. To use technology to create effective modes and means of instruction that expand access to learning resources and that enhance collaboration and communication for improved student learning.
6. To assess student learning and use assessment data to improve the teaching/learning system, curriculum, instruction, learning resources, counseling and student services.
7. To be organized as a for-profit institution in order to foster a spirit of innovation that focuses on providing academic quality, service, excellence, and convenience to the working student.
8. To generate the financial resources necessary to support the University's mission.

What Is It? Where Is It?
Never before have students, governments, and taxpayers clamored so loudly for increased accountability and transparency in education. The demand to show the links between the classroom, academic quality, and ultimately success in the workplace is affecting all levels of education. This situation becomes more problematic when trying to define academic quality in specific terms. The collective wisdom of academia has not been able to reach consensus. Nor has the federal government been able, despite repeated efforts, to come up with a definition of academic quality. Over time, various metrics have been proposed as significant indicators of quality; these include graduation rates, job placement rates, transfer rates, and rates of attrition and retention. While such numbers provide a type of quantification, they are often difficult for the public to understand and are subject to a wide anger of interpretation and discussion as to efficacy.

"The world-wide expansion of access to higher education has also created an increasing national and global demand for consumer information on academic quality. Because a college education is a rare purchase and an increasingly important as well as expensive decision in one's life, students and their families are seeking information that will help them make informed choices in the selection of a university and/or an academic program."
A Cross-National Analysis of University Ranking Systems, 2005
In the book it is noted that there is currently a "growing worldwide impatience with the quality of education, and indeed, with university outcomes generally." That is hardly an understatement. The U.S. Department of Education is particularly interested in the process of regional accreditation and whether it can properly regulate higher education. The Department has sought to demand standardized, quantifiable metrics while the accrediting bodies maintain that a standard set of metrics does not ensure the quality of a broad

spectrum of institutions, organized to meet a variety of needs, and with varying missions. Parents, students, and increasingly taxpayers want to know that an investment in higher education is one that will have value for individuals as well as the public in general. The dilemma is that while impatience grows, the difficulty with defining academic quality and determining appropriate metrics remains.
Defying Definition and Tradition
American society has progressed from an agrarian to industrialized economy and from there to the manufacturing giant that propelled the United States to global leadership. Today the American economy has evolved further to an information-driven, knowledge-based society. But while American society has transformed significantly, traditional higher education has remained a fairly consistent monolith, defined by historical conditions that no longer exist.
Most institutions of higher education still operate on a schedule designed to allow students to spend summers harvesting crops, returning to the classroom in the fall. And the classroom environment remains a product of formulas that equate quality with time in class. The structure of that time, in the traditional lecture format, remains despite clear evidence of its minimal effectiveness as a learning model.
Such basic issues point to seminal questions concerning quality. Primary among these is the issue of seat time as an indication of quality instruction. Indeed, once one looks beyond historical constraints, one wonders if time-to-degree is not merely an outgrowth of an earlier societal imperative. And in an era where knowledge is not the purview of the fewthe facultywho then disperse it to the manythe studentsit must be asked whether learning is not better facilitated by constructing knowledge, rather than by regurgitating facts memorized for midterms and finals which are then forgotten.
With more and more Americans wanting and needing quality education, and with American prosperity riding on it, higher education must find a way of accommodating growing

numbers of students while ensuring academic integrity in programs. This is not, however, only an American dilemma. The same discussions are being held worldwide, most noticeably in the Bologna Project, which looks to increase mobility and employability throughout Europe, to create participative equality, to allow more students to pursue higher education, and to correct the imbalance between rich and poor.

Misaligned Metrics
Most of the current measures of academic quality are those applied to full-time on-campus students, who make up only about one quarter of the total college enrollment in America. These students go directly from high school to college, attend classes full time, and experience residential life on campus. They then proceed to the world of work. For these students there is an orderly progression that can be tracked and quantified institutionally by such measures as graduation rates, job placement rates, or lifetime earnings.
However, some three-quarters of all students in America today do not fit this mold. They are older; they work full or part time and have family responsibilities, including financial obligations. These are the students we termed "Next Generation Learners" in the 2009 Academic Annual Report. Their progression is not linear or orderly and is complicated by a variety of life factors (i.e., risks), and yet access to higher education is vital.
For these students, measures such as graduation rates are not the best indicators of institutional success. To be specific, take the recent report commissioned by the Bill and
With Their Whole Lives Ahead

Melinda Gates Foundation. The authors found that the majority of students who leave college do so, not because the institution failed to keep them engaged or because they found the work too difficult, but due to finances. The main reason for students failing to complete a degree program is that they must drop out in order to work. Of those surveyed who dropped out, more than a third said that even if tuition and book fees were waived, they could not continue working toward a degree. They had to work to earn a living. Because money and
"Student success in college cannot be documented-as it usually is-only in terms of enrollment, persistence, and degree attainment. These widely used metrics, while important, miss entirely the question of whether students who have placed their hopes for the future in higher education are actually achieving the kind of learning they need for a complex and volatile world."
College Learning for the New Global Century, 2007
finances account for the majority of college dropouts, graduation rates are a misleading metric of institutional academic quality.
5
Similarly, job placement and earnings are subject to a multitude of pragmatic factors such as the state of the economy, the subject in which the student majors, the skill sets gained, and whether the applicant has the requisite interpersonal and interviewing skills to obtain a position. More to the point, these factors are largely irrelevant for working adults who are already in the job market.
In a related and highly charged issue, there is a call today to show the linkage between higher education and what the Department of Education has termed "gainful employment." The proposed regulation involves complex formulas linking student loans to potential earnings for graduates. Although the "gainful employment" spotlight has been focused on proprietary institutions, all of higher education should be alert to the fact that return on investment is becoming a key concern as public monies shrink and governments must ensure efficient use of taxpayer dollars.
6
Such gainful employment measures should in fact be only a portion of the larger equation, as they simply do not represent academic quality, nor do they encourage broad education goals designed to prepare students for the jobs of the future. Indeed, the innovations for
5
 
industries that have not yet been created will make it imperative for students to have strong foundations in critical thinking, teamwork, math, science, and the language arts rather than narrowly defined fields of employment.
Defining Quality: Where to Look and What to Look For
In a general sense, academic quality must be discussed from two perspectives. The first is as a measure of internal integrity in which key indicators that tie academic outcomes to student success are part of a system of continuous improvement. The second is as a set of measures by which, for better or worse, institutions can be compared in regard to student achievement.
That said, University of Phoenix has sought to improve the quality of its educational offerings by focusing on the essential elements of the student academic experience. This has permitted the University to identify those elements that must be addressed through an internal system of continuous improvement in order to better serve students, elements that can be tied to external benchmarks in order to ensure that students are indeed being better served. Through this process the University has identified curriculum, assessment of student learning outcomes, and faculty preparation as basic to the enterprise. It is these elements, we contend, that must be continually improved as part of the internal integrity process that defines academic quality at the University and which in turn results in student achievement that can be compared externally. This is a three-step process: 1) build quality, 2) measure quality, and 3) deliver quality.
Building Quality: Curriculum Development
To ensure academic integrity and to be certain that all courses map to the appropriate learning outcomes, University of Phoenix draws on the content expertise of more than 32,000 faculty. Curriculum is developed by the colleges in concert with a team of instructional designers who build courses and programs to outcomes informed by both internal and external constituencies: faculty, students, employers, programmatic accrediting bodies, and industry standards. The diagram below shows alignment from the University's Mission down to course objectives.
6
 
The implications of this system are significant as the higher education community considers the issues of awarding credit and how learning outcomes are tied to student success. Specifically, this system provides the ability to identify where within a course or program the learning experiences are provided to develop each student-learning outcome, the ways in which the outcome has been measured, and the results of that measurement. This measurement need not be tied to seat time or conventional definitions which, as we have discussed, are largely unrelated to actual learning.
In 2010 University of Phoenix received the Showcase in Excellence Award from the Arizona Quality Alliance (AQA) in recognition of the University's commitment to the development of quality academics through the Program Development Process.
7
In recognizing University of Phoenix, the Arizona Performance Excellence Award Program used the Baldrige National Quality Program criteria. The award committee indicated that the University of Phoenix Program Development Process consisted of four deliberate phases designed to optimize the alignment with three Baldrige-based core values: customer-driven
excellence, agility, and management by fact. The phases of the Program Development Process include research, conceptual design, and alignment with institutional and programmatic accrediting agency requirements. The process is designed to engage key stakeholder groups by directly utilizing their input, which in turn informs the development of academic programs.
"Recipients of the [Showcase in Excellence] award represent a high level of achievement in approach, deployment, learning, and integration of organizational process that produce excellent results. Recipients are expected to share their learning with other organizations."
AQA Performance Excellence Program
Measuring Quality: Assessment
As mentioned earlier the Bologna Project, which has been operating for some years in Europe, has been making recent headlines. In a June 2010 article in the Lumina Foundation stated it was "pleased enough with the initial results of the project, which focused on defining the knowledge and skills that a degree in a given discipline represents, that it wants to move on to the next stage." This focusdefining the knowledge and skills students are expected to possess upon graduating with a degree in a given disciplinehas been at the core of both the curriculum design and the assessment process at University of Phoenix for several years. It is, in fact, one of the major ways that the University believes academic quality can be engaged, ensured, and evaluated for improvement.
The Chronicle of Higher Education,

Assessment is two pronged: one prong devoted to student learning and one for institutional learning and change. Multiple methods are used to assess each student-learning outcome. From an internal perspective, the integrity of the learning assessment and institutional evaluation processes is essential because the data generated provide the fuel for continuous improvement. The data also provide the means for the faculty and administration to assess the degree to which goals related to student learning and achievement are being accomplished. In addition, they serve as a tool for identifying gaps and making improvements that will increase academic quality. Assessment of student learning leads to institutional learning. Finally, assessment data provide a basis for measuring outcomes against external benchmarks.
The University colleges review programmatic data to make changes and improvements in curriculum, instruction, and assessment processes. Each program is on an improvement cycle with its respective college. This allows the college to close the loop expediently wherever a gap in performance may occur. Armed with the information gained in the assessment processes, each college is well positioned to effectively allocate the time, resources, and expertise required to enhance student learning.

Delivering Quality: Faculty
University of Phoenix currently has more than 32,000 total faculty members. The faculty consists of Core and Associate Faculty members. Core Faculty make up approximately five percent of the total and their duties include a combination of instruction and curriculum oversight. The Associate Faculty are those faculty members contracted to teach on a course-by-course basis. The role of the faculty member in ensuring academic quality cannot be overstated. For many students, the faculty member is the face of the institution. This is particularly true in a non-residential institution such as University of Phoenix.
University of Phoenix faculty unite the curriculum with the student, and faculty members are encouraged to do this in a way that stimulates discovery, discussion, inquiry, knowledge sharing, and critical thinking skills. Faculty members are asked to facilitate learning by whatever means best suits the specific learning outcome they are addressing.
Faculty members at University of Phoenix, whether in the brick and mortar classroom or the virtual classroom, are asked to ensure that the learning is student centered. To assist faculty in this collaborative enterprise and to ensure fairly applied expectations, the University requires all potential faculty members, regardless of their previous teaching experience, to undergo a rigorous application, certification, and continuous-training process.
Through faculty recruitment, certification, assessment, and mentorship, the University provides the faculty members with a baseline set of outcomes to be successful and instruction in how to assess student learning. In addition, the University has implemented assessment procedures and metrics to gauge faculty success that allow for coaching, development, and timely intervention.
The journey to become a faculty member at University of Phoenix is both challenging and rewarding and ultimately is focused on enabling the faculty member to provide the best possible learning experience for students. Faculty selection is a process that includes three phases and in most cases takes between three and five months to complete. The process is as follows:
Many people express interest in becoming a member of the faculty at the University of Phoenix. Those interested get information by calling one of the campuses or through the website www.phoenix.edu. All prospective candidates must have an advanced degree from an accredited institution. A candidate may submit an online application which is then reviewed to determine if the applicant's background and credentials meet the instructional needs of the University.
Once the applicants become candidates, they are asked to complete Faculty Certification which is a four-week process that includes but is not limited to managing classrooms, meeting learning objectives, and grading and evaluation. All candidates are assessed and evaluated throughout the certification process. Certification also gives faculty candidates an opportunity to experience the University in the same way students do. Candidates are asked to complete assignments and to make use of the learning assets and tools available to them and to the students.
Once the candidates have successfully completed Faculty Certification, they are assigned contracts to teach a class under the supervision of Faculty Mentors who provide feedback. The Faculty Mentors also make recommendations to the administration as to the suitability of the candidates. The process from application to approval as a member of the University of Phoenix faculty can take from three to five months to complete.

The University is committed to the ongoing professional development of its faculty. This commitment is evidenced by the variety of programs and activities available to develop and enhance faculty effectiveness. Regular training and development activities are offered at the brick and mortar classroom as well as online. These activities provide opportunities for faculty members to enhance and expand their teaching, assessment, and professional skills. Also, ongoing faculty evaluation continues at both campus Academic Affairs and the Central Administration levels. Quality-control processes and systems have been developed to measure and monitor quality in the classroom.
Reports are generated, distributed on the University-wide intranet, and reviewed by Central Administration Academic Operations as well as campus personnel. These include the following:
In addition, faculty members are evaluated in several ways, including the following:
The results of these three integrated systems devoted to quality can be measured externally by the performance of University of Phoenix students as compared to national benchmarks. These results, along with the lessons learned to date, are presented in the next section.

Today the United States competes in a knowledge-based global economy. The demands of the workplace require workers who will continue their education beyond high schooland in most cases, throughout their lifetimes. To meet that demand the University offers more than 100 degree programs at the associate through doctoral levels. Students can attend class online, in a brick and mortar classroom, or a combination of both.

Accreditation
University of Phoenix operates campuses and learning centers in 39 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The University must conform to all state and national laws regarding licensed businesses and the regulations of various departments of education as well as higher education regulatory authorities in each jurisdiction in which the University operates.
University of Phoenix is regionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and a member of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and has held this accreditation since 1978. In addition to regional accreditation, the University has applied for and been granted programmatic accreditation for several individual academic programs:

In general, there is congruency in results this year as compared to the last two Academic Annual Reports (, ). Student and faculty diversity in ethnicity and gender remain about the same as last year. In the area of student satisfaction, the results reported in the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) are essentially the same as in 2009.

In the area of information literacy, the results shown from the Standardized Assessment of Information Literacy Skills (SAILS) indicate that scores for seniors are greater than those for freshmen. The general education knowledge and skills of freshmen and seniors, as measured by the ETS Proficiency Profile, were roughly equivalent to the scores of freshmen and seniors from last year.

The completion rates for the University show a slight decline in the percentage of students graduating in 150 percent of the traditional time to degree completion. The University believes that these changes arise from difficulties associated with current economic conditions. However, the University believes the new orientation program (outlined in the 2009 Academic Annual Report and detailed later in this report) could mitigate this decline, in part by ascertaining student commitment.

Comparative Outcome Results
Student Satisfaction
The University regularly conducts student satisfaction surveys and uses these results to implement change within the organization. The following tables show student satisfaction at University of Phoenix as compiled from internal surveys.
Student End-of-Course Surveys
As these surveys indicate, University of Phoenix students rate each category high at approximately 90 percent or better in each area.
Table 2: UOPX Student Satisfaction
Note: Results shown for a partial year, as a change in the measurement tool was implemented after April 2010.
Source: University of Phoenix Student End-of-Course Surveys, available to students at the end of every course.
End-of-Program Surveys
End-of-Program Surveys indicate that students feel their experience at the University was a positive one. When asked at the end of their degree programs how they felt about their experiences at the University, they rated all services and categories well above average.

Alumni Survey
The satisfaction level with a University of Phoenix education and experience continues after students graduate. Overall, alumni rated the University positively in all categories.

National Survey of Student Engagement
University of Phoenix also uses an external measure of student satisfaction, the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE). This year's survey reports on the 2009 academic year. In an effort to ensure a geographically diverse sample, the FY09 NSSE was administered on a voluntary basis to all freshmen and seniors at four University of Phoenix campuses: Atlanta, Detroit, Houston, and Phoenix.
As noted in the following tables, University of Phoenix seniors' responses that relate to the stated University of Phoenix Learning Goals are compared to accumulated average responses by students attending other institutions of higher education offering at least baccalaureate through master's degree programs. In nine of the ten categories, University of Phoenix students rate the University higher than the national average response rating; in the remaining category, University of Phoenix students rate their satisfaction with "Acquiring a broad general education" at the same rate as their peer group.

Information Literacy
The skills required to become successful in the digital workplace are woven throughout the five Learning Goals required for all University of Phoenix courses and programs: professional competence and values, critical thinking and problem solving, communication, information utilization, and collaboration.
In addition, the University has taken steps to ensure that the way students learn emulates the way professionals work today. The University Library houses more than 75,000 unique full-text publications and 280 information resources. The University Library is available to users seven days a week from anywhere there is an Internet connection. The University has been building an eBook Collection that now contains approximately 1,900 books and reference sources being used in 91 percent of all courses. Students and faculty have access to the entire eBook Collection throughout their degree programs.
Another example is Virtual Organizations, which are realistic web-based businesses, schools, health care, and government organizations that promote authentic assessment by immersing students into problem-based learning environments. Virtual Organizations provide a solution to the difficulties students have in gaining access to proprietary information. They also provide a relevant context for students to practice solving workplace problems. Virtual Organizations are distinct from simulations and case studies because they present students with a microcosm of the real world. Students must first determine what data is needed to solve a problem, locate the appropriate information by data mining a specific Virtual Organization, and apply that information to solve the problem. Virtual Organizations provide students a full range of data that includes financial statements, personnel records, and other information essential to practice applying theoretical knowledge to solving problems. An average of 50,000 unique users access Virtual Organizations each month.
Standardized Assessment of Information Literacy Skills
In an effort to benchmark student achievement in information literacy as compared to students from other similar institutions and to make internal University of Phoenix comparisons, the University makes use of the Standardized Assessment of Information Literacy Skills (SAILS) originally developed by Kent State University.
15
The SAILS assessment is based on the following Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education:

20
 
A random sample of undergraduate University of Phoenix students was asked via email to voluntarily participate in the SAILS program. The sampling frame included students who had attended a course in the last six months but who were not included in the SAILS administration in 2009.
As the SAILS Freshmen table shows, on average University of Phoenix freshmen scored as well or better in half of the eight areas measured through the SAILS assessment; in the four remaining areas, they had lower scores than freshmen students at other institutions offering at least baccalaureate through master's level programs. However, after taking into account the standard error, the performances between the two groups were essentially equivalent except on the Documenting Sources skill set. On that skill set, University of Phoenix freshmen on average underperformed students in the comparison group.
Table 6: SAILS Freshmen
Note: "Outperformed" = UOPX students had a statistically significant higher mean score on the skill set compared to the normative group. "Underperformed" = UOPX students had a statistically significant lower mean score. "Equivalent" = the mean scores were statistically equivalent. Alpha () = 0.05 for all significance tests. Scores range from 0 to 1000.

Academic Proficiency and Progress
In the last twenty years, the accreditation community has placed significantly greater emphasis on the importance of assessing student learning.
ETS
Proficiency Profile
As a part of the assessment process, University of Phoenix has used the Measure of Academic Proficiency and Progress (MAPP) assessment developed by the Educational Testing Service (ETS) and reported the results in the 2008 and 2009 Academic Annual Reports. This year, ETS changed the name from MAPP to the ETS Proficiency Profile (EPP). The skill sets measured and the metrics used remain the same.
17
ETS is a non-profit organization with a mission to advance" quality and equity in education for people worldwide by creating assessments based on rigorous research." ETS administers the EPP, a test of college-level skills in critical thinking, reading, writing, mathematics, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences for undergraduate students. The assessment was developed to assist institutions in evaluating the outcomes of general education programs to improve the quality of instruction and learning. According to their website, EPP results allow the institution to:

Completion Rates
Below are completion rates for University of Phoenix showing associate, baccalaureate, and graduate students, as well as the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) public institution completion rates. IPEDS only considers "first-time" college students. University of Phoenix, however, includes all students.
19
The University calculates completion rates of all enrolled students, including first-time attendees as well as those with prior college experience. The University completion rate is defined as the percentage of students who completed at least three credits and went on to be degree-complete within 150 percent of normal degree completion time. Data are collected on the number of students entering the institution as degree-seeking students in a particular cohort year.

In accordance with the Higher Education Act (HEA) of 1965, as amended, each postsecondary educational institution must publish information regarding graduation rates as defined by the National Center for Education Statistics (IPEDS). This graduation measure includes only undergraduate degreeseeking students who have never attended another institution of higher learning and who graduate within 150 percent of normal time to completion. Data are collected on the number of students entering the institution as full-time, first-time degree seeking or certificate-seeking undergraduate students in a particular cohort year.

Lessons Learned: Improving the Quality of the Student Experience
The completion rates for the University show a slight decline from the rates shown in the 2009 Academic Annual Report in the percentage of students graduating in 150 percent of the traditional time to degree completion. The University believes that most of these changes arise from difficulties associated with current economic conditions. However, the University's orientation program announced in the 2009 Academic Annual Report may help mitigate future declines by giving students the opportunity to better understand the demands of a college education, and if needed, self-select out prior to enrolling at the University.
The orientation program was developed in an effort to assist students succeed at the University and to try to assist prospective students in making an informed decision about whether to invest their time, money, and effort. The University began limited beta testing of a no-charge, pass/fail orientation in 2009. The orientation program was designed for those students entering the University with fewer than 24 credits.
"The more institutions accept their responsibility [for student learning] the more the students will. Where institutions are clear as to the expected learning outcomes, where there are meaningful assessments of student learning, and where these assessments guide continuous efforts to improve the quality of learning, the student's sense of responsibility for truly mastering learning soars."
The Future of Higher Education, 2004
University Orientation is three weeks long and delivered in the same format as a regular class. Students must complete non-graded assignments that are similar in nature to the way they will be working in class. With the addition of this requirement prior to enrollment, prospective students gain a better understanding of the time commitments required for university-level study and how it will or will not fit into their busy lives.
The beta test of the new University Orientation program was rolled out to approximately 30,000 students. The results of that beta group show that approximately 80 percent of the students who start the University Orientation finish it. The retention rates for those who complete University Orientation are higher than those for students who do not go through the program.

The increase in initial retention rate suggests that program completion rates may eventually improve, which is one of the goals of the University Orientation. These students also appear to be faring better in the critical first three classes; these initial courses are the ones that historically have proven to be the point at which most students drop out. Anecdotal evidence from faculty indicates that the students who have completed orientation are better prepared for the rigors of the classroom. Students report that they come out of University Orientation with a positive attitude. This was reported by a large group of students, which included those students who did not complete the orientation successfully, and those who, after gaining a clear understanding of what would be expected of them, self-selected out and did not enroll in a degree program.
University administrators have reviewed the comments and results of the new student orientation and have determined that this program is a valuable tool to increase student retention, academic success, and an understanding of expectations prior to enrollment. Student participation in an orientation that mirrors the way they will be expected to learn in an accelerated environment, with a clear understanding of the type of assignments that will be required, will assist the University in placing the right student in the right program.
The University believes that the results of the new student orientation, although somewhat preliminary in nature, show that students are benefiting from the new program. It is hoped that the increase in course completion by students who have successfully completed the new orientation will continue and may eventually result in increased persistence throughout the students' degree programs. The orientation was implemented University-wide in November 2010, and the resulting increase in retention will not show up as an increase in completion rates until sometime in the future when the students earn their degrees.
Affordability and Return on Investment
Student Salary Increases While Enrolled
Many University of Phoenix students are employed full time while enrolled. Internal research has shown that University of Phoenix students' average annual salaries for the time they are enrolled in their program of study increase at higher rates than the national average salary increase for the same time period.

The 2010 Academic Annual Report has focused on the issue of quality and input measures that can be directly associated with student success and institutional effectiveness. The 2009 Academic Annual Report outlined issues that the University is addressing as opportunities to increase student academic achievement and success. The quality initiatives identified in the 2010 Report, in addition to those described in the 2009 report, have begun to bear results.
In the 2009 Report, we described the curriculum for a three-week orientation program that would allow prospective students an opportunity to "test drive" the University prior to enrolling. The orientation was designed to address the heuristic skills necessary for success at University of Phoenix as well as to introduce the participants to the format and accelerated environment in which they would be learning should they decide to enroll.
In October 2009, the University rolled out the University Orientation to campuses that had been shown to have a high drop-out rate in the first four classes. In the original rollout, more than 30,000 students participated in the new student orientation. As indicated earlier in this report, the results of that beta group show that approximately 80 percent of the students who start the University Orientation finish it. The retention rates for those who complete University Orientation are higher than those for students who do not go through the program.
As a result, the orientation was rolled out University-wide on November 1, 2010. It is the University's hope that this program may increase student retention and overall success. The University is currently gathering analytical data and feedback from students and faculty members on a regular basis in order to continue to update and improve the orientation.
The second phase of the administration's plans outlined in the 2009 Academic Annual Report was the initiation of a First-Year Sequence for students in the associate program and those students enrolling in the bachelor's programs with fewer than 24 credits. In FY2009 nearly all associate degree-seeking students and a substantial percentage of students entering the bachelor's programs fell into that category.
The First-Year Sequence was introduced at all campuses in February 2010 and was designed with a laddering concept with material taught over multiple courses. In this way, concepts introduced in early classes are reinforced with work done in later classes. The First-Year Sequence was also designed to provide a stable foundation and a sense of community for entry-level students.
Results of the First-Year Sequence will be reported in the 2011 Academic Annual Report. Finally, the third initiative discussed in the 2009 Report was a new perspective on remediation in the form of Just-In-Time skills. The University introduced services to students that would allow them to access the skills they needed when they needed them and when they could apply them to the appropriate coursework. The premise of this new approach is that an all-or-nothing course, taken before a student can enter a program or enroll in specific classes, does nothing to promote long-term learning or the ability to apply the skills when they are requiredin some cases months or perhaps years after going through a remedial course.
Today the Centers for Mathematics and Writing Excellence provide students with access to the assistance and tools necessary to solve complicated math problems and write at an academic level effectively and concisely.
In 2010 the Center for Mathematics Excellence expanded the services offered to students by adding Live Class Tutoring and a Worksheet Center. In the Live Classrooms, students are able to talk with a tutor via a toll-free teleconference line as well as login to the Center
29
 
for visual demonstrations. The Worksheet Center allows students to work through math functions and basic geometric formulas. The worksheets are processed on a whiteboard and answers are provided immediately. This allows students to work in private and self-evaluate where they need to focus their efforts in improving their mathematics skills. In an average month, more than 5,600 unique users access the tutoring services provided by the Center.
In addition, the Center for Mathematics Excellence continues to assist students with hundreds of math tutorials and videos as well as pre-algebra assistance. The Math Anxiety Center helps students deal with the complexities and perceived problems associated with math classes. In an average month, more than 20,000 unique users access the Center for Mathematics Excellence for information on how to succeed in mathematics.
Resources contained in the Center for Writing Excellence include the WritePoint System, Tutor Review, the Spanish Writing Lab, Tutorials and Guides, and the Turnitin Plagiarism Checker. WritePoint is an automated system that provides students with immediate feedback on grammar, punctuation, word usage, and some style points. This is accomplished within minutes and is operational 24/7. WritePoint reviews an average of more than 150,000 papers each month.

NOTES AND DEFINITIONS FOR TABLE 15 COST TO TAXPAYERS
Analysis includes all U.S, degree granting institutions that are eligible for Title IV.
Institutions:
Information obtained from IPEDS for all schools as reported under the IPEDS definition for Fall 2008 full-time equivalent students.
Student Enrollment Data:
Information obtained from IPEDS for GASB institutions and private non-profit institutions or public institutions using FASB includes federal/state/local government operating contracts and appropriations (Pell awards included). Information obtained from IPEDS for FASB proprietary institutions includes state/local government grants and federal/state/local government appropriations (Pell awards excluded). Pell award information for FASB proprietary institutions was obtained from the Department of Education website.
Direct Government Support:
Subsidized Title IV loan information obtained from the Department of Education website. The three month Treasury bill rate was used assuming a one year interest subsidy for amounts loaned.
Interest on Subsidized Loans:
Assumes that although more than 100 percent is collected on average for each Title IV dollar loaned by the government, the government could earn the equivalent amount of interest through the issuance of treasury bills. In addition, data is not available to determine if interest repayment trends are different between institutional types. However, lifetime default rates vary significantly between institutional types. The lifetime budgeted default rates for the 2007 cohort of students, per a report by the Department of Education issued in December 2009, along with 2007 two year cohort default rates, also published by the Department of Education, were used to determine expected default rates by institutional type. The lifetime budgeted default rates of 17.2 percent used for the public and private non-profit institutions is based on an average of four-year freshman - senior rates. The lifetime budgeted default rate of 39.5 percent used for the proprietary institutions is based on the two-year proprietary institutions lifetime budgeted default rate. The two-year proprietary institutions lifetime budgeted default rate of 47 percent was weighted at 20 percent based on the number of full-time equivalent students in the two-year category as a percentage of the total in the proprietary institutions. The four-year proprietary institutions rate was determined based on the relationship of the four-year proprietary institutions 2007 cohort default rate of 9.8 percent as compared to the two-year proprietary institutions rate of approximately 12.25 percent and applying this ratio to the two-year proprietary institutions lifetime budgeted default rate of 47 percent. This rate for the expected four-year proprietary institutions lifetime budgeted default rate was then weighted at 80 percent based on the number of full-time equivalent students in the four-year category as a percentage of the total in the proprietary institutions.
Loan Defaults:
Public and Private Non-Profit:
Proprietary:
The recovery rate used for defaulted loans is the same for all institutions, 60.6 percent. This was then multiplied by the defaulted loans total to get the recovery dollar amount. The recovery rate was calculated using information from the Department of Education - SFA Collections, The White House - Office of Management and Budget ("The President's Budget 2009"), student loan collection industry's collection fees, and Apollo Group estimates.
Recovery on Loans:

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
Phoenix, January 10, 2011  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or the "Company") today reported financial results for the three months ended November 30, 2010.
"During the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we began the important process of implementing several of the key strategic initiatives that we've been developing in recent quarters and that are designed to enhance the student experience, expand student protections and ensure that we enroll students who we believe have a greater likelihood to succeed in our programs," said Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer and Apollo Global Chairman Greg Cappelli. "While we do not yet have enough data from these new initiatives to draw firm conclusions, we are pleased with the early results."
Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer Chas Edelstein added, "While these initiatives are resulting in a period of transition, we expect to prudently manage our cost structure to appropriately align it with both the size of the business and the needs of our students. We believe these actions are the right things to do for our students, and importantly, we are confident that over time they will solidify our leadership role within the industry and put our organization on a path of more consistently delivering high quality growth."
Unaudited First Quarter of Fiscal 2011 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 totaled $1,326.4 million, which represents a 5.4% increase over the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Consolidated net revenue growth in the first quarter was primarily driven by selective tuition price increases at University of Phoenix. Although University of Phoenix Degreed Enrollment declined 3.8% year-over-year to 438,100, average enrollment during the quarter increased slightly, resulting in a modest increase in revenue. A $9.0 million decrease in net revenue from BPP, due to lower student enrollment and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, also offset some of the increase. Lower Degreed Enrollment at University of Phoenix is in part the result of a 42.4% decrease in New Degreed Enrollment. The Company believes this decline is principally due to the adverse impact on the admissions process arising from changes in the manner in which admissions and other employees are evaluated and compensated, the full implementation of University Orientation as well as continued refinement of the Company's marketing approaches.
The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended November 30, 2010, of $236.0 million, or $1.61 per share (146.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $240.4 million, or $1.54 per share (156.0 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended November 30, 2009. Results for
1
 
the first quarter of fiscal 2011 contain special items totaling $4.7 million pre-tax ($2.9 million after tax) consisting of a $3.8 million restructuring charge associated with a strategic reduction in force, primarily at University of Phoenix, and a $0.9 million charge for accrued incremental post-judgment interest related to a securities class action lawsuit. The fiscal 2010 first quarter results included a tax benefit of $11.4 million resulting from the settlement of disputed tax issues with the Internal Revenue Service.
Excluding these special items, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended November 30, 2010, was $238.9 million, or $1.63 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $229.0 million, or $1.47 per share for the three months ended November 30, 2009. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Operating Expenses
Effective during the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, the Company elected to revise its presentation of operating expenses and reclassified prior periods to conform to the revised presentation. There were no changes to total operating expenses or operating income as a result of these reclassifications. (Please refer to the Form 10-Q for the period ended November 30, 2010, filed concurrently with this release for the presentation of operating expenses as previously reported and as reclassified for prior periods of fiscal 2009 and 2010.)
Instructional and student advisory expenses increased by $25.2 million, or 5.8%, to $455.8 million for the three months ended November 30, 2010, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2009. As a percentage of revenue, instructional and student advisory expenses increased 10 basis points to 34.3% versus 34.2% in the prior year's first quarter. The increase, as a percentage of revenue, was primarily due to various strategic initiatives implemented to more effectively support students and improve their educational outcomes, which has resulted in increased compensation related to certain student advisory and infrastructure support functions.
Marketing expenses increased by $14.5 million, or 9.6%, to $166.1 million for the three months ended November 30, 2010, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2009. As a percentage of revenue, marketing expenses increased 50 basis points to 12.5% versus 12.0% in the prior year's first quarter. The increase, as a percentage of revenue, was primarily a result of higher advertising expenditures, driven by the increased costs associated with the Company's transition in marketing approaches to more effectively identify students who have a greater likelihood to succeed in its educational programs and increases in advertising rates for traditional and online media. This increase was partially offset by lower employee compensation costs as a percentage of revenue.
Admissions advisory expenses decreased by $1.5 million, or 1.3%, to $113.8 million for the three months ended November 30, 2010, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2009. As a percentage of revenue, admissions advisory expenses decreased 60 basis points to 8.6% versus 9.2% in the prior year's first quarter. The decrease, as a percentage of revenue, was a result of lower admissions advisory headcount during the first quarter of fiscal 2011 as compared to the prior-year period. This decrease was partially offset by higher average employee
2
 
compensation costs, as the Company elevates the educational profile for admissions personnel. The above-mentioned strategic reduction in force that eliminated approximately 700 full-time positions, principally among admissions personnel, will favorably impact expenses beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses increased by $14.2 million, or 20.1%, to $84.9 million for the three months ended November 30, 2010, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2009. As a percentage of revenue, G&A expenses increased 80 basis points to 6.4% versus 5.6% in the prior year's first quarter. The increase, as a percentage of revenue, is primarily attributable to expenses associated with the Company's investments in its information technology resources and capabilities, as well as various expenses related to regulatory and external affairs activities, partially offset by lower legal expenses.
The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable ("bad debt expense") decreased by $5.8 million, or 9.3%, to $56.9 million for the three months ended November 30, 2010, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2009. As a percentage of revenue, bad debt expense decreased 70 basis points to 4.3% versus 5.0% in the prior year's first quarter. The decrease, as a percentage of revenue, is primarily attributable to reductions in gross accounts receivable as a result of the full implementation of University Orientation and other recent operational changes and initiatives to more effectively support students and improve their educational outcomes. Improved collection rates at University of Phoenix also contributed to the decrease as a result of improved effectiveness of the Company's collection efforts for aged receivables.
Depreciation and amortization increased by $2.4 million, or 6.9%, to $37.1 million for the three months ended November 30, 2010, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2009. The increase was primarily due to increased depreciation related to computer equipment and software, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of BPP intangible assets. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation and amortization expenses were unchanged at 2.8% when compared with the prior year's first quarter. The Company expects an increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 resulting from investments in core information technology and network infrastructure to adversely impact depreciation and amortization beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
Financial and Operating Metrics
Below are Apollo Group's unaudited financial data and operating metrics for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 versus the prior-year period.

Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of November 30, 2010, the Company's cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $1,040.5 million as compared to $1,284.8 million as of August 31, 2010. The decrease is attributable to repayments on borrowings, share repurchases, capital expenditures and an increase in restricted cash, partially offset by cash generated from operations. Restricted cash and cash equivalents (including long-term) increased by $28.3 million compared to August 31, 2010, primarily due to increased student deposits associated with students receiving financial aid.
At November 30, 2010, accounts receivable decreased to $256.9 million from $264.4 million at August 31, 2010. Excluding accounts receivable and the associated net revenue for Apollo Global, the Company's days sales outstanding ("DSO") was 26 days at November 30, 2010, compared to 30 days at August 31, 2010, and compared to 32 days at November 30, 2009. The decrease in DSO versus a year ago is primarily attributable to reductions in gross accounts receivable as a result of the full implementation of University Orientation and other recent operational changes and initiatives to more effectively support students and improve their educational outcomes. Improved collection rates at University of Phoenix also contributed to the decrease as a result of improved effectiveness of the Company's collection efforts for aged receivables.
Total debt outstanding (including short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt) decreased by $403.0 million to $181.4 million at November 30, 2010, from $584.4 million at August 31, 2010. The decrease is due to the repayment of U.S. denominated borrowings on the Company's $500 million credit facility.
Share Repurchases
During the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company repurchased approximately 4.7 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $37.58 per share for a total expenditure of $176.5 million. Subsequent to quarter end, the Board of Directors increased the authorization of management to repurchase Class A common shares to the current total amount of $600 million.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
This press release and the related conference call contain non-GAAP financial measures, which are intended to supplement, but not substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Management uses, and chooses to disclose to investors, these non-GAAP financial measures because (i) such measures provide an additional analytical tool to clarify the Company's results from operations and help to identify underlying trends in its results of operations; (ii) as to the non-GAAP earnings measures, such measures help compare the Company's performance on a consistent basis across time periods; and (iii) these non-GAAP measures are employed by the Company's management in its own evaluation of performance and are utilized in financial and operational decision-making processes, such as budgeting and forecasting. Exclusion of items in our non-GAAP presentation should not be construed as an inference that these items are unusual,
6
 
infrequent or non-recurring. Other companies, including other companies in the education industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure across companies.

     Apollo Group, Inc. subsidiary, University of Phoenix, has received an Expedited Final Program Review Determination Letter from the U.S. Department of Education in respect of the Department's December 2010 review of the University's financial aid programs subject to Title IV of the Higher Education Act for the 2009-2010 award year and 2010-2011 award year to date. There were no significant adverse findings in the program review. The Department concluded that the University has initiated or completed acceptable corrective actions in respect of each compliance item identified in the review and each finding has been closed. No economic or other sanctions were imposed.
     A copy of the Department's Expedited Final Program Review Determination Letter is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
     The information in Item 8.01 of this Form 8-K and Exhibit 99.1 furnished herewith shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that section, nor shall they be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
Dear Mr. D'Amico,
From December 6, 2010 through December 10, 2010, Marcia Clark, Dale Hillard, Mark Hamburg, Renee Gullotto, and Randi Korenstein conducted a review of University of Phoenix's (UOP) administration of the programs authorized pursuant to Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, 20 U.S.C.  1070 et seq. (Title IV, HEA programs). The purpose of this Final Program Review Determination Letter is to close the program review.
The focus of the review was to determine UOP's compliance with the statutes and federal regulations as they pertain to the institution's administration of Title IV programs. The review consisted of an examination of UOP's 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 (July 1, 2010 through December 10, 2010) award years.
A sample of 30 files was identified for review from the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 award years. The files were selected randomly from a statistical sample of the total population receiving Title IV, HEA program funds for each award year. Appendix A lists the names and social security numbers of the students whose files were examined during the program review. In addition, student and instructor interactions in six distance education courses were examined.
Although the review was thorough, it cannot be assumed to be all-inclusive. The absence of statements in the report concerning UOP's specific practices and procedures must not be construed as acceptance, approval, or endorsement of those specific practices and procedures. Furthermore, it does not relieve UOP of its obligation to comply with all of the statutory or regulatory provisions governing the Title IV, HEA programs.
The School Participation Team-San Francisco/Seattle has made a Final Program Review Determination concerning the findings that were identified during the program review. Following is a discussion of the findings identified and the resolution of those findings.
 
University of Phoenix OPE ID: 02098800 PRCN: 201110927380 Page 2 of 6
Finding 1. Exit Counseling Requirements Not Met
Institutions must ensure that exit counseling is provided to each FFEL/DL borrower shortly before the student ceases to be enrolled half time at the institution or within 30 days of a student's withdrawal or graduation. The exit counseling must inform the borrower of the estimated monthly repayment amount on the student's outstanding loan(s), review repayment options, suggest debt-management strategies, review conditions under which a student borrower may defer or apply for forbearance of repayment or obtain a full or partial discharge, and require the student borrower to provide current contact information. Exit counseling must emphasize the seriousness of the repayment obligation and describe the likely consequences of default. The institution must maintain documentation that substantiates compliance with exit counseling provisions. 34 C.F.R.  682.604(g).
Citation:
UOP failed to maintain sufficient documentation that its students completed the exit counseling requirements for the period July 1, 2010 to December 10, 2010.
Noncompliance:
UOP changed its procedures for performing exit counseling beginning July 1, 2010. Rather than mailing the hard copy exit interview documents to its students, UOP began sending emails to students for whom exit interviews were required. The emails provided the students with a link that enabled them to access the Department's interactive website for completing the exit interview requirements. However, UOP failed to follow up to determine if students had completed the exit counseling requirement, and UOP failed to follow up with students in writing or by email with the required exit interview documents when students failed to complete exit counseling.
The following student files did not contain documentation that an exit interview was performed by UOP: Students #12, 16, 18, 19, 23, and 28
UOP is in the process of identifying students who failed to complete required exit counseling and of sending each of these students an email that contains the required exit counseling documentation.
Final Determination:
UOP has initiated an acceptable corrective action. This finding is closed.
Finding 2. Failure to Coordinate Non-Title IV Resources for Packaging Title IV Funds
A student's total financial aid and other estimated financial assistance (EFA) may not exceed a student's financial need as determined under  428 of the Higher Education Act (HEA). EFA is defined as the estimated amount of assistance for a period of enrollment that a student or a parent will receive from federal, state, institutional, or other sources, such as scholarships, grants, net earnings from need-based employment, or loans, including, but not limited to, an educational benefit paid because of enrollment in a postsecondary education institution, or to cover postsecondary education expenses. 34 C.F.R.  682.200(b).
Citation:
 
University of Phoenix OPE ID: 02098800 PRCN: 201110927380 Page 3 of 6
If an institution treats a waiver as a payment of tuition and fees charged to a student then that waiver of tuition and fees would be considered as a financial aid resource and the cost of attendance calculation would include the full amount of the tuition and fees. Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) GEN-00-24.
UOP failed to include tuition waivers as EFA in four of 30 files reviewed. Specifically, UOP provided [1] tuition waivers to employees from [1] who became UOP students. UOP offered a $70 per course tuition reduction as a promotion to one of its students. Additionally, UOP offered a tuition discount to a student in the military. These discounts were not included as EFA in the following students' files.
Noncompliance:
UOP had previously notified the Department of its failure to include tuition discounts as other resources when packaging Title IV funds. The failure to coordinate these resources and include them as EFA was reported in both UOP's 2008 compliance audit, and in the Program Review Report that was issued by the Department on December 28, 2010[2].
 
 
University of Phoenix OPE ID: 02098800 PRCN: 201110927380 Page 4 of 6
UOP representatives informed reviewers that in response to the compliance audit finding and the subsequent finding in the Program Review Report, UOP initiated an automated processing enhancement that is being completed in two phases. The first phase prioritized the packaging of all UOP employees that received full tuition discounts, as these large discounts could have resulted in students receiving over awards. As there was no off-the-shelf software capable of handling the complexity of UOP's borrower based packaging needs and resource calculations, UOP was required to customize an application to handle all other discounts. The development of this processing enhancement has taken longer than UOP expected.
During its implementation of the final phase of this automation, UOP established a process that elicited from students, on the financial aid application, pertinent information about scholarships, grants, waivers, employee tuition assistance, discounts and other financial resources that support their education. These self-reported benefits are evaluated as EFA when the student's financial aid awards are calculated.
The systematic solution UOP is developing to enhance its existing systems will identify other benefits a student receives to pay tuition and fees, such as support from other employers, tuition discounts and waivers. The automated solution will identify the amount of any benefit paid directly to the student's account, evaluate if the student previously reported the benefit and support an analysis of whether the benefit on the student account would cause the student to have resources greater than the student's financial need or cost of attendance. The automated solution, which is expected to be implemented by August 31, 2011, will include additional controls at the point financial aid is awarded and at the time of disbursement to identify changes between those events.
The review team confirmed that UOP's cost of attendance is high enough that these minimal tuition discounts do not cause over awards even if students are eligible for the maximum federal and state financial aid. Additionally, UOP is in the process of completing its software upgrade to identify all other resources.
Final Determination:
UOP has initiated an acceptable corrective action. This finding is closed.
Finding 3. Incorrect Determination Date for Return of Title IV Calculation
When a recipient of Title IV grant or loan assistance withdraws or is terminated from an institution during a payment period or period of enrollment in which the recipient began attendance, the institution must determine the amount of Title IV grant or loan assistance that the student earned as of the student's withdrawal date. 34 C.F.R.  668.22, 34 C.F.R.  668.173(b).
Citation:
Student #14 was academically dismissed from UOP on 4/4/10. The determination date for the student was recorded as 5/2/10, which was 29 days after the official withdrawal date.
Noncompliance:
 
University of Phoenix OPE ID: 02098800 PRCN: 201110927380 Page 5 of 6
UOP applied its policy for unofficial withdrawal in this student's case. This resulted in the student being "out of attendance" for 29 days beyond the official withdrawal date before UOP established its determination date for this student.
It is important to note that the Return to the Title IV programs (R2T4) was made in a timely manner even though UOP used the incorrect date of determination.
This was an isolated incident that affected one student. No further action is required. UOP has taken the corrective actions necessary to resolve this finding. Therefore, UOP may consider this finding closed, with no further action required.
Final Determination:
Record Retention:
Program records relating to the period covered by the program review must be retained until the later of: resolution of the loans, claims or expenditures questioned in the program review; or the end of the retention period otherwise applicable to the record under 34 C.F.R.
 668.24(e).

     Apollo Group, Inc. announced today that the U.S. Supreme Court has denied Apollo Group's petition for a writ of certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals' decision in the class action securities litigation entitled, . In June 2010, the Ninth Circuit reversed the July 2008 ruling of the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona setting aside the January 2008 jury verdict against Apollo Group. The effect of the denial of certiorari is that the Ninth Circuit decision stands and, accordingly, the matter will now be returned to the District Court to address the claims procedure.
Apollo Group, Inc., et al. v. Policeman's Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago
The final amount of damages will not be known until all court proceedings have been completed and all eligible members of the class have presented the necessary information and documents to receive payment of their portion of the award of damages. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2010, Apollo Group recorded a charge for estimated damages in the amount of $132.6 million, which, together with the then existing reserve of $44.5 million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010, represented the mid-point of the estimated range of damages calculated on the basis of a statistical analysis plus other estimated costs and expenses ($127 million to $228 million). Apollo Group has recorded charges in subsequent periods, including $0.9 million in both the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 and in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, for estimated incremental post-judgment interest. The final amount of damages payable may be more, or less, than the estimated range.
At November 30, 2010, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $1.0 billion and availability under our principal revolving credit facility of approximately $400 million. We believe we have ample liquidity to fund the payment of any damages that may be payable in connection with this litigation.
For more information about this lawsuit, see in Note 15 of the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended November 30, 2010, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 10, 2011 and available on our website at .

If Tenant is hereafter required to subordinate its interests under this Lease to the lien of any mortgage or deed of trust or to any lienholder in the future, Tenant's obligation to subordinate its interests is conditioned upon any such lienholder or prospective lienholder providing Tenant with a commercially reasonable non-disturbance
Non-Disturbance

     17.2. . Upon reasonable advance notice (except in the event of an emergency), Landlord and Landlord's agents shall have the right to enter the Premises at reasonable times for the purpose of inspecting the same, showing the same to prospective purchasers or lenders, and exercising its rights under this Lease.

Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, if Landlord's entry onto the Premises or other exercise of its rights under this Lease interferes with Tenant and such interference causes a material adverse impact on Tenant's operations at, use or enjoyment of the Premises and such impact continues beyond forty-eight (48) hours, Tenant shall be entitled to an equitable abatement of Rent for such period of time as the interference continues, unless such entry is during an emergency.

Any such statement may be conclusively relied upon by any person to whom it shall be delivered by the Requesting Party, including any prospective purchaser or encumbrancer of the Premises, or any part thereof. The Certifying Party's failure to deliver such statement within such time shall be conclusive upon the Certifying Party that this Lease is in full force and effect, without modification except as may be represented by the Requesting Party, that there are no uncured defaults in the Requesting Party's performance; and that not more than one month's Fixed Rent has been paid in advance. If more than one estoppel certificate is requested in any calendar year, the Requesting Party shall reimburse the Certifying Party upon demand therefor for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Certifying Party in connection with its review of any statement provided pursuant this Paragraph, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     On March 29, 2011, Apollo Group, Inc. issued a press release announcing its financial results for the three months ended February 28, 2011. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated in this Item 2.02 by this reference.
     The information in Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K and the exhibit furnished herewith shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
     On March 24, 2011, the Board of Directors of Apollo Group, Inc. appointed Darby E. Shupp as a director of Apollo Group to fill an existing vacancy on the board.
     Ms. Shupp is employed by Exeter East, LLC, which is a holding company wholly-owned by Dr. John Sperling, Apollo Group's Executive Chairman. Ms. Shupp serves as an officer and/or director of various entities affiliated with Dr. Sperling and his investment company Moral Compass Corporation, including Arcadia Biosciences Inc. and ViaGen Inc.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
     As we previously disclosed, we received two demand letters from different shareholders in November and December 2010 to investigate, address and commence proceedings against each of our directors and certain of our officers for violation of any laws in connection with various corporate actions and developments over the past few years. This type of demand is a condition precedent under Arizona law to the filing of a derivative lawsuit on behalf of Apollo Group seeking damages from directors and officers for breach of fiduciary duty.
     On March 24, 2011, after the finalization of our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended February 28, 2011 and before the Form 10-Q was filed, a shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the Superior Court for the State of Arizona, Maricopa County by Daniel Himmel, one of the foregoing shareholders who previously made a demand for investigation. In the complaint, the plaintiff asserts a derivative claim on our behalf against certain of our current and former officers and directors for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, and unjust enrichment. The complaint alleges that the individual defendants made improper statements and engaged in improper business practices that caused our stock price to drop, led to securities class actions against us, and enhanced regulation and scrutiny by various government entities and regulators. We have not yet been served with the complaint.
     The information in Item 8.01 of this Form 8-K shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject
 
to the liabilities under that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.

(d) Exhibits.
The following exhibit is furnished herewith:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
Phoenix, March 29, 2011  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or the "Company") today reported financial results for the three and six months ended February 28, 2011.
"During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we continued to execute on the key strategic initiatives that we've been developing and implementing, which are designed to enhance the student experience, expand student protections and ensure that we enroll students who we believe have a greater likelihood to succeed in our programs," said Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer and Apollo Global Chairman Greg Cappelli. "While these initiatives are resulting in a period of transition for our business, we are pleased that we have recently begun to see signs of improvement in several of the leading indicators of future activity."
Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer Chas Edelstein added, "While we are in the early stage of implementing these initiatives, we are excited to see some initial positive signs, such as improving rates of student retention for those who complete Orientation and subsequently enroll, a continued mix shift toward our higher degree-level programs, and lower bad debt expense. We believe these actions are the right things to do for our students, and importantly, we are confident that over time they will solidify our leadership role within the industry and put our organization on a path of more consistently delivering high quality growth."
Unaudited Second Quarter of Fiscal 2011 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 totaled $1,048.6 million, which represents a 2.0% decrease from the second quarter of fiscal 2010, principally due to lower enrollments at University of Phoenix, partially offset by selective tuition price increases, a favorable mix shift toward higher degree-level programs, and improved student retention rates. University of Phoenix Degreed Enrollment decreased 11.6% to 405,300 compared with the prior year's second quarter, primarily due to a 44.9% decrease in New Degreed Enrollment compared with the prior year period. The Company believes the decline in New Degreed Enrollment is primarily the result of the operational changes and initiatives it has implemented to more effectively support students and improve educational outcomes, including changes in the manner in which admissions and other employees are evaluated and compensated, the full implementation of University Orientation, and the continued refinement of the Company's marketing approaches to more effectively identify students who have a greater likelihood to succeed in University of Phoenix's educational programs. Also contributing to the decrease in consolidated net revenue was a $6.4 million decrease in net revenue at Apollo Global in the second quarter compared to the prior year period, due to lower student enrollment at BPP and UNIACC.

The Company reported a loss from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended February 28, 2011, of $66.6 million, or $0.47 per share (142.4 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding), compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $103.2 million, or $0.67 per share (155.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding) for the three months ended February 28, 2010.
Results for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 contain special items that include goodwill and other intangibles impairment charges of $219.9 million for the BPP subsidiary of Apollo Global ($188.3 million net of noncontrolling interests) and a $1.6 million charge for accrued incremental post-judgment interest and other estimated costs related to a securities class action lawsuit (). The Company recorded a tax benefit of $5.0 million, net of noncontrolling interests, associated with these charges. The Company did not record a net tax benefit associated with the goodwill impairment, as it is not deductible for tax purposes. The fiscal 2010 second quarter results included a pre-tax charge of $44.5 million ($26.9 million net of tax) representing an accrual related to the previously mentioned securities class action lawsuit.
Policeman's Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago
Excluding these special items, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended February 28, 2011, was $118.2 million, or $0.83 per share (142.7 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding), compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $130.1 million, or $0.84 per share for the three months ended February 28, 2010. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Operating Expenses
Instructional and student advisory expenses increased by $6.2 million, or 1.5%, to $421.6 million for the three months ended February 28, 2011, compared to the three months ended February 28, 2010. The increase was primarily due to various strategic initiatives implemented to more effectively support students and improve their educational outcomes, which has resulted in increased compensation related to certain student advisory and infrastructure support functions and increased curriculum development and delivery costs.
Marketing expenses increased by $15.9 million, or 11.3%, to $157.2 million for the three months ended February 28, 2011, compared to the three months ended February 28, 2010. The increase was primarily a result of higher advertising expenditures, driven by the increased costs associated with the Company's efforts to more effectively identify students who have a greater likelihood to succeed in its educational programs and increases in advertising rates for traditional and online media due to increased competition for higher degree level students.
Admissions advisory expenses decreased by $15.9 million, or 13.4%, to $102.3 million for the three months ended February 28, 2011, compared to the three months ended February 28, 2010. The decrease was a result of lower admissions advisory headcount, including the strategic reduction in force implemented during the first quarter of fiscal 2011 that eliminated approximately 700 full-time positions, principally among admissions personnel. Compensation expense was favorably impacted by a reduction of approximately $8 million in the second
2
 
quarter of fiscal 2011 related to this reduction in force, the majority of which was in admissions advisory. This decrease was partially offset by higher average employee compensation costs.
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses increased by $15.5 million, or 22.6%, to $84.3 million for the three months ended February 28, 2011, compared to the three months ended February 28, 2010. The increase is primarily attributable to expenses associated with the Company's investments in its information technology resources and capabilities, as well as various expenses related to compliance and external affairs activities.
The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable ("bad debt expense") decreased by $28.3 million, or 38.4%, to $45.5 million for the three months ended February 28, 2011, compared to the three months ended February 28, 2010. The decrease is primarily attributable to reductions in gross accounts receivable as a result of decreases in New Degreed Enrollment and improvements in student retention rates, partially due to the full implementation of University Orientation. Improved collection rates at University of Phoenix also contributed to the decrease.
Depreciation and amortization increased by $3.9 million, or 11.1%, to $39.1 million for the three months ended February 28, 2011, compared to the three months ended February 28, 2010. The increase was primarily due to increased depreciation related to computer equipment and software, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of BPP intangible assets.

Unaudited First Six Months of Fiscal 2011 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the six months ended February 28, 2011, was $2.4 billion, a 2.0% increase over the comparable period of fiscal 2010. The increase in consolidated net revenue was primarily attributable to selective tuition price increases at University of Phoenix, partially offset by a 3.2% decrease in University of Phoenix's average Degreed Enrollment during the six months ended February 28, 2011, as compared to the six months ended February 28, 2010. The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $169.4 million, or $1.17 per share, (144.7 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding), and $343.7 million, or $2.21 per share, (155.6 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding) for the six months ended February 28, 2011, and February 28, 2010, respectively.
Results for the six months ended February 28, 2011 contain special items that include goodwill and other intangibles impairment charges of $219.9 million for the BPP subsidiary of Apollo Global ($188.3 million net of noncontrolling interests), a $2.5 million charge for accrued incremental post-judgment interest and other estimated costs related to a securities class action lawsuit (), and a $3.8 million restructuring charge associated with a strategic reduction in force, primarily at University of Phoenix. The Company recorded a tax benefit of $6.9 million, net of noncontrolling interests, associated with these charges. The Company did not record a net tax benefit associated with the goodwill impairment, as it is not deductible for tax purposes. Results for the six months ended February 28, 2010 contain a pre-tax charge of $44.5 million ($26.9 million net of tax) representing an accrual related to the previously mentioned securities class action lawsuit and a tax benefit of $11.4 million resulting from the settlement of disputed tax issues with the Internal Revenue Service.
Policeman's Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago
Excluding these special items, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the six months ended February 28, 2011 was $357.1 million, or $2.47 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $359.2 million, or $2.31 per share, for the six months ended February 28, 2010. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of February 28, 2011, the Company's cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $1,033.3 million as compared to $1,284.8 million as of August 31, 2010. The decrease is attributable to repayments on borrowings, share repurchases, capital expenditures and an increase in restricted cash, partially offset by cash generated from operations. Restricted cash and cash equivalents (including long-term) increased by $21.5 million compared to August 31, 2010, primarily due to increased student deposits associated with students receiving financial aid.
At February 28, 2011, accounts receivable decreased to $217.8 million from $264.4 million at August 31, 2010. Excluding accounts receivable and the associated net revenue for Apollo Global, the Company's days sales outstanding ("DSO") was 22 days at February 28, 2011, compared to 30 days at August 31, 2010 and February 28, 2010. The decrease in DSO versus a
5
 
year ago is primarily attributable to reductions in gross accounts receivable as a result of decreases in New Degreed Enrollment and improvements in student retention, partially due to the full implementation of University Orientation. Improved collection rates at University of Phoenix also contributed to the decrease.
Total debt outstanding (including short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt) decreased by $393.4 million to $191.0 million at February 28, 2011, from $584.4 million at August 31, 2010. The decrease is due to the repayment of U.S. denominated borrowings on the Company's $500 million credit facility.
Share Repurchases
The Company repurchased approximately 1.8 million and 6.5 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $42.75 and $38.99 per share for a total expenditure of $75.0 million and $251.5 million during the three and six months ended February 28, 2011, respectively. As of February 28, 2011, approximately $525 million remained available under the Company's current share repurchase authorization.
Business Outlook
The Company offers the following commentary regarding the outlook for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 based on the business trends observed during the second quarter of fiscal 2011, as well as management's current expectations of future trends, which could change.
Fiscal 2011:

As previously disclosed, Apollo Group, Inc. subsidiary University of Phoenix received a letter in August 2010 from its principal accreditor, the Higher Learning Commission ("HLC"), requesting certain information and evidence of compliance with HLC accreditation standards. The request was instigated by the August 2010 report published by the U.S. Government Accountability Office of its undercover investigation into the enrollment and recruiting practices of a number of proprietary institutions of higher education, including University of Phoenix. We submitted our response to HLC in September 2010 and subsequently responded to a further request for information.
On March 29, 2011, University of Phoenix received a letter from HLC indicating that the information submitted had been reviewed by a committee of peer reviewers and HLC staff and that the committee concluded that the materials submitted raised a number of questions about the University of Phoenix's oversight of its recruiting, admissions and financial aid practices and the ability of those practices to serve students effectively while providing them with clear and accurate information. Accordingly, HLC provided a list of specific questions developed by the committee to be addressed by University of Phoenix no later than April 29, 2011. These questions relate to:
HLC stated that the committee would meet with representatives of University of Phoenix in late May if it continues to have questions about the University's practices, and that the committee expects to issue its final report in May or June 2011. The committee has indicated to HLC that there may be recommendations for corrective action to be monitored through HLC's monitoring processes.
We expect to provide a thorough response to the committee's questions in a timely manner, and we look forward to our continuing dialog with HLC. We note in this regard, that many of the areas which are the focus of the committee's additional questions are areas where we have been active in the past several quarters in further enhancing the student experience and our already strong student protections.
For a further discussion of the accreditation of University of Phoenix and this HLC review, please see in our 2010 Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 21, 2010 and available on our website at apollogrp.edu.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
Dismissal of Teamsters Local Union Putative Class Action Lawsuit
On March 31, 2011, the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona dismissed with prejudice the lawsuit entitled, , Case Number 06-cv-02674-RCB, and entered judgment in favor of Apollo Group.
Teamsters Local 617 Pension & Welfare Funds v. Apollo Group, Inc. et al.
The lawsuit, which was filed in November 2006, alleged that we and certain of our current and former directors and officers violated federal securities laws by purportedly making misrepresentations concerning our stock option granting practices and related accounting. Plaintiffs sought to assert class action status on behalf of a class of Apollo Group shareholders who purchased our stock between November 2001 and October 2006. In March 2009, plaintiffs' amended complaint was dismissed in part, with leave to amend. The court has now issued a 78-page opinion dismissing plaintiffs' second amended complaint in its entirety and with prejudice, and has entered judgment in favor of Apollo Group and the individual defendants and against plaintiffs. We expect the plaintiffs to seek a reconsideration of this ruling and, if that is not successful, to appeal the ruling.
We have not previously accrued any liability associated with this matter.
For more information about this lawsuit, see Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2010 Form 10-K annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 21, 2010.

     (e) Material Compensatory Plan, Contract or Arrangement.
      On April 13, 2011, Apollo Group, Inc. (the "Company") and Mr. Gregory W. Cappelli, the Company's Co-Chief Executive Officer, entered into an amended and restated employment agreement (the "Restated Agreement") that replaces the existing employment agreement between the Company and Mr. Cappelli dated March 31, 2007 and subsequently amended.
Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with Gregory W. Cappelli.
     Under the Restated Agreement, the term of Mr. Cappelli's employment agreement has been extended from April 1, 2011 to August 31, 2014. During the extended term, Mr. Cappelli will continue to serve as Co-Chief Executive Officer. For the period from April 1, 2011 to August 31, 2011, Mr. Cappelli's base salary will increase on an annualized basis from $600,000 to $650,000. For each subsequent fiscal year within the term of the Restated Agreement, Mr. Cappelli's annual base salary will be increased as follows:
     For each fiscal year within the term of the Restated Agreement, Mr. Cappelli's target bonus will be set at not less than 100% of his rate of base salary for that year. In addition to the cash compensation, Mr. Cappelli received the following long-term equity incentive awards under the Restated Agreement on April 13, 2011:
     - a stock option grant covering 235,000 shares of the Company's Class A common stock with an exercise price of $39.88 per share, the closing price per share on the grant date;
     - a restricted stock unit award covering 248,000 shares of the Company's Class A common stock (the "Base RSU Award");
     - for the stub period between the April 2, 2011 effective date of Mr. Cappelli's extended agreement and the close of the Company's 2011 fiscal year, an additional restricted stock unit award covering 49,000 shares of the Company's Class A common stock (the "Stub-Period RSU Award"); and
     - a special retention grant in the form of a restricted stock unit award covering 38,000 shares of the Company's Class A common stock (the "Special Retention RSU Award").
     The stock option grant will vest in 4 successive equal annual installments over Mr. Cappelli's period of continued employment with the Company measured from the grant date and has a maximum term of 6 years. The Base RSU Award has a performance-vesting condition tied to the Company's after-tax net income for the 2012 fiscal year, as adjusted for certain specified items. Upon the satisfaction of that performance condition, 25% of that award will vest on the last day of the 2012 fiscal year, and the balance will vest in 3 successive equal annual installments beginning with the April 13, 2013 vesting date, provided Mr. Cappelli continues in the Company's employ through each such vesting date.
 
     - The Stub-Period RSU Award also has a performance-vesting condition tied to the Company's after-tax net income for the 2012 fiscal year, as adjusted for certain specified items. Upon the satisfaction of that performance condition for the award, 50% of the award will vest on the last day of the 2012 fiscal year, and the balance will vest in 2 successive equal annual installments beginning with the April 13, 2013 vesting date, provided that Mr. Cappelli continues in the Company's employ through each such vesting date.
     - The Special Retention RSU Award will vest in a series of annual installments over Mr. Cappelli's continued employment with the Company's employ through the third anniversary of the grant date.
     - Should Mr. Cappelli's employment terminate under certain specified circumstances prior to the completion of the applicable vesting schedule for each equity award, he will receive additional months of service-vesting credit under each such award, and he will also have up to a maximum 24-month period following such termination in which to exercise the vested portion of his option grant.
     In addition, Mr. Cappelli will receive an equity award with grant-date fair value of $4.14 million at the same time as the annual awards for the Company's other executive officers are made for the 2012 fiscal year (expected to occur in June or July 2011). The components of that additional award have not yet been determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.
     All of the other terms and provisions that were in effect under Mr. Cappelli's employment agreement immediately prior to the execution of the Restated Agreement, including his entitlement to cash severance payments in the event his employment terminates under certain specified circumstances, will continue in effect under the Restated Agreement.
     A copy of Mr. Cappelli's employment agreement with the Company dated March 31, 2007 has been filed as Exhibit 10.18 to the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2006 and copies of the two amendments to that agreement have been filed as exhibits the following reports of the Company: Amendment No. 1 filed as Exhibit 10.6 to the Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2008; and Amendment No. 2 filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the current report on Form 8-K filed on April 27, 2009. A copy of Mr. Cappelli's April 13, 2011 amended and restatement employment agreement with the Company will be filed as an exhibit to the Company's Form 10-Q report for the fiscal quarter ending May 31, 2011.

     Today, Apollo Group, Inc. announced that its subsidiary, The University of Phoenix, Inc., has received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Office of the Attorney General of Massachusetts.

qui tam
United States of America and State of California, ex rel Derek Hoggett and Tavis Wood v. University of Phoenix, Apollo Group, et.al.
     The complaint alleges, among other things, that since December 12, 2009, University of Phoenix has violated the Federal False Claims Act and the California False Claims Act by falsely certifying to the U.S. Department of Education and the State of California that the University was in compliance with various regulations that require compliance with federal rules regarding the payment of incentive compensation to enrollment personnel, in connection with the University's participation in student financial aid programs. The relators seek injunctive relief, fines, treble damages and other damages on behalf of the U.S. and the State of California.
     The U.S. Department of Justice and the State of California have declined to intervene in the case.
     Apollo Group is evaluating the complaint and expects to be served by the relators in due course.

Exhibit 99.1
Phoenix, June 30, 2011  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or the "Company") today reported financial results for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2011.
"During the third quarter, we continued to execute on our key initiatives to improve outcomes, enhance student protections, and elevate the educational experience throughout every touch point of the student lifecycle," said Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer and Apollo Global Chairman Greg Cappelli. "We are encouraged by the progress we are making in improving retention rates and continuing to shift the mix of our students toward higher degree level programs."
Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer Chas Edelstein added, "We are committed to differentiating the University of Phoenix by focusing on academic quality and delivering a world class student experience. Our actions, over time, are intended to elevate the brand and reputation of our institutions, improve student outcomes, reduce enterprise risk, and position us for stable, long-term growth."
Unaudited Third Quarter of Fiscal 2011 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 totaled $1,235.8 million, which represents a 7.6% decrease from the third quarter of fiscal 2010, principally due to lower enrollments at University of Phoenix, partially offset by selective tuition price and other fee changes. For the quarter, University of Phoenix Degreed Enrollment decreased 16.4% to 398,400 compared with the prior year third quarter, primarily due to decreases in New Degreed Enrollment in recent quarters, including a 40.5% decrease in New Degreed Enrollment in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 compared with the prior year period. The Company believes the decline in New Degreed Enrollment is primarily the result of the operational changes and initiatives it has implemented to more effectively support students and improve educational outcomes, as well as the broader competitive environment. The operational changes include the manner in which admissions personnel and other employees are evaluated and compensated, the full implementation of University Orientation, and the Company's efforts to more effectively identify students who have a greater likelihood to succeed in University of Phoenix's educational programs.
The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended May 31, 2011, of $211.9 million, or $1.51 per share (140.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding), compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $177.2 million, or $1.16 per share (152.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding) for the three months ended May 31, 2010.
 
Results for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 contain special items that include a $2.0 million pre-tax charge ($1.2 million net of tax) for accrued incremental post-judgment interest and future estimated legal costs related to a securities class action lawsuit () and a tax benefit of $9.6 million resulting from the resolution with the Internal Revenue Service regarding the deductibility of payments made to settle a lawsuit in fiscal 2010. The fiscal 2010 third quarter results contain special items that include a goodwill impairment charge of $8.7 million ($7.5 million net of the portion attributable to noncontrolling interest) and a $132.6 million pre-tax charge ($79.9 million net of tax) representing an accrual related to the securities class action lawsuit mentioned above. The Company did not record a net tax benefit associated with the goodwill impairment, as it is not deductible for tax purposes
Policeman's Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago
Excluding these special items, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended May 31, 2011, was $203.5 million, or $1.45 per share (140.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding), compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended May 31, 2010 of $264.6 million, or $1.74 per share (152.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding). (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Operating Expenses
Instructional and student advisory expenses increased by $16.4 million, or 3.7%, to $458.1 million for the three months ended May 31, 2011, compared to the three months ended May 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to various strategic initiatives implemented to more effectively support students and improve their educational outcomes, which have resulted in increased compensation expense related to certain student advisory and infrastructure support functions and increased curriculum development and delivery costs.
Marketing expenses increased by $9.4 million, or 6.2%, to $161.0 million for the three months ended May 31, 2011, compared to the three months ended May 31, 2010. The increase was primarily a result of higher advertising expenditures, driven by the increased costs associated with the Company's efforts to more effectively identify students who have a greater likelihood to succeed in its educational programs and increases in advertising rates for traditional and online media due to increased competition for higher degree level students and improving general economic conditions.
Admissions advisory expenses decreased by $16.4 million, or 14.1%, to $99.9 million for the three months ended May 31, 2011, compared to the three months ended May 31, 2010. The decrease was a result of lower admissions advisory headcount primarily attributable to a strategic reduction in force implemented during the first quarter of fiscal 2011 that eliminated approximately 700 full-time positions, principally among admissions personnel. This decrease was partially offset by higher average employee compensation costs.
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses increased by $12.5 million, or 16.6%, to $87.9 million for the three months ended May 31, 2011, compared to the three months ended May 31, 2010. The increase is primarily attributable to expenses associated with higher employee
 
compensation costs and other expenses associated with the Company's investments in its information technology resources and capabilities.
The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable ("bad debt expense") decreased by $32.8 million, or 45.5%, to $39.2 million for the three months ended May 31, 2011, compared to the three months ended May 31, 2010. The decrease is primarily attributable to reductions in gross accounts receivable as a result of decreases in New Degreed Enrollment, a shift in the mix of students from Associates to higher degree-level programs, and improvements in student retention rates, partially due to the full implementation of University Orientation. Improved collection rates at University of Phoenix, which were favorably impacted by ongoing process improvements and an initiative to address the Company's oldest receivables, also contributed to the decrease.
Depreciation and amortization increased by $4.4 million, or 12.1%, to $41.1 million for the three months ended May 31, 2011, compared to the three months ended May 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to increased depreciation related to information technology, network infrastructure and software, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of BPP intangible assets and depreciation of principal office buildings in respect of which the Company entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement.
Financial and Operating Metrics
Below are Apollo Group's unaudited financial data and operating metrics for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 versus the prior-year period.
 
 
 
Unaudited First Nine Months of Fiscal 2011 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the nine months ended May 31, 2011, was $3.6 billion, a 1.5% decrease from the comparable period of fiscal 2010. The decrease in consolidated net revenue was primarily attributable to a 6.6% decrease in University of Phoenix's average Degreed Enrollment in the first nine months of fiscal year 2011 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2010, partially offset by selective tuition price and other fee changes at University of Phoenix. The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $381.3 million, or $2.66 per share, (143.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding), and $520.9 million, or $3.37 per share, (154.5 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding) for the nine months ended May 31, 2011, and May 31, 2010, respectively.
Results for the nine months ended May 31, 2011 contain special items that include goodwill and other intangibles impairment charges of $219.9 million for the BPP subsidiary of Apollo Global ($188.3 million net of the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests), a $4.5 million charge for accrued incremental post-judgment interest and future estimated legal costs related to a securities class action lawsuit (), and a $3.8 million restructuring charge associated with a strategic reduction in force, primarily at University of Phoenix. The Company recorded a tax benefit of $7.7 million, net of noncontrolling interests, associated with these charges, along with a tax benefit of $9.6 million resulting from the resolution with the Internal Revenue Service regarding the deductibility of payments made to settle a lawsuit in fiscal 2010. Results for the nine months ended May 31, 2010 included a goodwill impairment charge of $8.7 million ($7.5 million net of the portion attributable to noncontrolling interest), a $177.1 million pre-tax charge ($106.8 million net of tax) representing an accrual related to the securities class action lawsuit mentioned above, and a tax benefit of $11.4 million resulting from the settlement of disputed tax issues with the Internal Revenue Service. The Company did not record a net tax benefit associated with the goodwill impairment in either period, as it is not deductible for tax purposes.
Policeman's Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago
Excluding these special items, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the nine months ended May 31, 2011 was $560.6 million, or $3.91 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $623.8 million, or $4.04 per share, for the nine months ended May 31, 2010. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of May 31, 2011, the Company's cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $1,426.3 million as compared to $1,284.8 million as of August 31, 2010. The increase is attributable to cash generated from operations, a decrease in restricted cash, and proceeds from the sale-leaseback of the Company's principal office buildings in Phoenix, Arizona, partially offset by repayments on borrowings, share repurchases and capital expenditures. Restricted cash and cash equivalents (including long-term) decreased by $194.3 million compared to August 31, 2010, primarily due to the return of funds associated with the release of the Company's cash- collateralized letter of credit in the amount of approximately $126 million in connection with a previous program review of University of Phoenix by the U.S. Department of Education.
 
At May 31, 2011, accounts receivable decreased to $227.2 million from $264.4 million at August 31, 2010. Excluding accounts receivable and the associated net revenue for Apollo Global, the Company's days sales outstanding ("DSO") was 23 days at May 31, 2011, compared to 30 days at August 31, 2010 and May 31, 2010. The decrease in DSO versus a year ago is primarily attributable to reductions in gross accounts receivable as a result of decreases in New Degreed Enrollment, a shift in the mix of students from associates to higher degree-level programs, and improvements in student retention, partially due to the full implementation of University Orientation. Improved collection rates at University of Phoenix also contributed to the decrease.
Total debt outstanding (including short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt) decreased by $389.1 million to $195.3 million at May 31, 2011, from $584.4 million at August 31, 2010. The decrease is due to the repayment of U.S. denominated borrowings on the Company's $500 million credit facility.
Share Repurchases
The Company repurchased approximately 4.1 million and 10.6 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $40.26 and $39.48 per share for a total expenditure of $167.3 million and $418.7 million during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2011, respectively. At May 31, 2011, $11.8 million was recorded in accrued liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for repurchased shares that settled subsequent to May 31, 2011. As of May 31, 2011, approximately $357.7 million remained available under the Company's current share repurchase authorization.
Business Outlook
The Company offers the following commentary regarding the outlook for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 based on the business trends observed during the third quarter of fiscal 2011, as well as management's current expectations of future trends, which could change.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
As previously disclosed, Apollo Group, Inc. subsidiary University of Phoenix received a letter in August 2010 from its institutional accreditor, the Higher Learning Commission ("HLC"), requesting certain information and evidence of compliance with HLC accreditation standards. The letter related to the August 2010 report published by the U.S. Government Accountability Office of its undercover investigation into the enrollment and recruiting practices of a number of proprietary institutions of higher education, including University of Phoenix. We submitted our response to HLC in September 2010 and subsequently responded to further requests for information.
On July 11, 2011, HLC informed University of Phoenix that the Special Committee formed to review this matter had completed its work, concluding that based on its limited review, it found no apparent evidence of systematic misrepresentations to students or that University of Phoenix's procedures in the areas of recruiting, financial aid and admissions are significantly inadequate or inappropriate. These were the areas on which HLC's review was focused.
HLC also stated that there remain significant questions as well as areas that the University should work on improving. HLC indicated that these will be reviewed by the comprehensive evaluation team at its previously scheduled visit beginning in March 2012. These questions relate to: students in collection and the minimization of student loan defaults; the offering of limited career services particularly in relation to the University of Phoenix's associate degree program; timing of prospective student access to financial aid advisors during the recruiting process; academic qualifications of enrollment advisors and financial aid advisors; the hiring and evaluation of financial aid officers; retention of students, including the relationship of remediation to retention; and the role of the University of Phoenix First Year Sequence in relation to University of Phoenix's transfer policy and impacts on student retention.
For a further discussion of the accreditation of University of Phoenix and this HLC review, please see in our 2010 Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 21, 2010 and available on our website at apollogrp.edu.

The following exhibits are provided herewith:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Phoenix, August 2, 2011  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or the "Company") today announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of the stock of Carnegie Learning, Inc., a publisher of research-based math curricula including the adaptive Cognitive Tutor math software, for $75.0 million. In a separate transaction, Apollo also announced it has agreed to acquire related technology from Carnegie Mellon University for $21.5 million, payable over a 10-year period.
The acquisitions allow Apollo to accelerate its efforts to incorporate adaptive learning into its academic platform and to provide tools to help raise student achievement in mathematics, which supports improved retention and graduation rates.
"We are excited to partner with Carnegie Learning which will allow us to integrate their high quality educational and adaptive learning technology into our platform," said Gregory Cappelli, Co-CEO of Apollo Group and Chairman of Apollo Global. "Carnegie Learning offers a highly individualized, innovative solution, addressing a fundamental skills gap in mathematics that is prevalent among today's postsecondary students."
Carnegie Learning was founded in 1998 by a team of cognitive and computer scientists from Carnegie Mellon University, in conjunction with veteran mathematics teachers. Representative of one of the university's successful spinouts, Carnegie Learning provides math instruction to more than 600,000 students in 3,000 schools nationwide.
"Carnegie Learning has developed what we believe is a differentiated approach to learning that will help the students in all of our universities achieve classroom success," said Chas Edelstein, Co-CEO of Apollo Group. "In Carnegie Learning, we are working with a talented team and a market leader in adaptive learning. We are also exploring opportunities for further collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University in the science of learning."
Carnegie Learning integrates adaptive learning technology into instructional, assessment, and problem-solving activities to strengthen student conceptual understanding and underlying math proficiency. Adaptive learning methodologies adjust the presentation of educational curriculum to individually address a student's developmental needs, while continuously assessing comprehension, resulting in a more effective learning experience.
"We believe that adaptive and personalized learning is the future of education," said Dennis Ciccone, CEO of Carnegie Learning. "We are seeing significant, measurable results in student
 
engagement and performance in mathematics, an essential subject to this generation of learners who must prepare to compete in a highly competitive global economy. We look forward to expanding the effectiveness of these adaptive learning methodologies into the Apollo academic platforms and continuing to serve our students and teachers."
As a wholly owned subsidiary of Apollo Group, Carnegie Learning will continue to service the K-12 space, where it is successfully implementing its innovative learning solutions and professional development programs in districts around the country. Given Apollo's postsecondary focus, the Company intends to evaluate strategic alternatives for the K-12 portion of the business in order to support Carnegie Learning's continued success in this market.
The Company currently anticipates the acquisitions to be value accretive over the long term and $0.07-$0.09 dilutive to earnings per share in fiscal 2012, in part due to non-cash amortization of intangibles. The acquisitions are subject to customary closing conditions and are anticipated to be completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2012.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Phoenix, October 19, 2011  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or the "Company") today reported financial results for the three months and fiscal year ended August 31, 2011.
"We set out at the beginning of 2011 to implement leading-edge student protections, differentiate University of Phoenix, and expand our business," said Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer Chas Edelstein. "We are pleased with our progress in each of these areas, including enhancing our student-centric approach to admissions, launching University Orientation, investing in our learning platform, and advancing our plans to incorporate adaptive learning and connect education to careers."
Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer and Apollo Global Chairman Greg Cappelli added, "Through our focus on academic quality and innovation, we are aligning learning outcomes to student and employer needs and helping to bridge the workforce skills gap, one of the biggest issues facing our economy today. Our commitment is to support our students in achieving long-term success."
Unaudited Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2011 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 totaled $1,122.1 million, which represents a 10.9% decrease from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, principally due to lower enrollments at University of Phoenix, partially offset by selective tuition price and other fee changes and improving rates of student retention. For the quarter, University of Phoenix Degreed Enrollment decreased 19.1% to 380,800 compared with the prior year fourth quarter, primarily due to decreases in New Degreed Enrollment in recent quarters, including a 33.5% decrease in New Degreed Enrollment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 compared with the prior year period. The Company believes the decline in New Degreed Enrollment was primarily the result of the operational changes and initiatives it has implemented to more effectively support students and improve educational outcomes, as well as the broader competitive environment. The operational changes included the manner in which admissions personnel and other employees are evaluated and compensated, the full implementation of University Orientation, and the Company's efforts to more effectively identify students who have a greater likelihood to succeed in University of Phoenix's educational programs.
The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended August 31, 2011, of $188.6 million, or $1.37 per share (137.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $47.5 million, or $0.32 per share (148.3 million weighted
average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended August 31, 2010. Results for the fourth quarters of fiscal 2011 and 2010 included a number of special items that are detailed below.
Results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 included the following:
 
 
 
 
Results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 included the following:
 
 
Excluding the items noted above, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended August 31, 2011, was $139.6 million, or $1.02 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $193.9 million, or $1.31 per share for the three months ended August 31, 2010. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Operating Expenses
Instructional and student advisory expenses decreased by $6.8 million, or 1.5%, to $438.5 million for the three months ended August 31, 2011, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2010. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in faculty costs associated with lower University of Phoenix and Apollo Global enrollment, partially offset by investment in initiatives to more effectively support students and improve their educational outcomes. These initiatives have resulted in increased compensation expense related to certain student advisory and infrastructure support functions.
Marketing expenses decreased by $8.2 million, or 4.6%, to $171.0 million for the three months ended August 31, 2011, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2010. The decrease was primarily a result of a reduction in internet spending, partially offset by investments in non-internet branding.
 
Admissions advisory expenses decreased by $17.2 million, or 14.7%, to $99.4 million for the three months ended August 31, 2011, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2010. The decrease was a result of lower admissions advisory headcount, partially offset by higher average employee compensation costs.
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses increased by $12.4 million, or 14.3%, to $98.7 million for the three months ended August 31, 2011, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to nonrecurring costs to support the formation and independence of Nexus, an educational policy and research organization.
The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable ("bad debt expense") decreased by $34.4 million, or 46.5%, to $39.6 million for the three months ended August 31, 2011, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2010. The decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in gross accounts receivable as a result of decreases in University of Phoenix enrollment, a shift in the mix of students from Associates to Bachelors degree level programs, and the full implementation of University Orientation, which has favorably impacted student retention rates. Improved collection rates at University of Phoenix, which were favorably impacted by ongoing business process improvements and an initiative to address the Company's oldest receivables, also contributed to the decrease.
Depreciation and amortization increased by $2.7 million, or 6.9%, to $41.6 million for the three months ended August 31, 2011, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to capital expenditures in fiscal years 2010 and 2011 related to information technology, network infrastructure and software, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of BPP intangible assets.
 
Financial and Operating Metrics
Below are Apollo Group's unaudited financial data and operating metrics for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 versus the prior year period.
 
 
 
2011 Fiscal Year Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2011, was $4.7 billion, a 3.9% decrease from fiscal year 2010. The decrease in consolidated net revenue was primarily attributable to a 9.2% decrease in University of Phoenix's average Degreed Enrollment in fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010, principally due to a 40.3% decrease in aggregate New Degreed Enrollment for the four quarters of fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010. The decrease was partially offset by selective tuition price and other fee changes at University of Phoenix and improving rates of student retention.
The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $569.9 million, or $4.02 per share, (141.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2011, compared to $568.4 million, or $3.72 per share, (152.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2010.
Results for the fiscal years 2011 and 2010 contained special items, which are detailed in the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information tables of this press release.
Excluding these special items, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2011, was $700.2 million, or $4.94 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $817.7 million, or $5.35 per share for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2010. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of August 31, 2011, the Company's cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $1,571.7 million, compared to $1,284.8 million as of August 31, 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to cash generated from operations, proceeds from the sale-leaseback of the Company's principal office buildings in Phoenix, Arizona, and the return of funds associated with the release of the Company's cash-collateralized letter of credit in the amount of approximately $126 million in connection with a previous program review of University of Phoenix by the U.S. Department of Education. The increase was partially offset by share repurchases and capital expenditures.
At August 31, 2011, accounts receivable decreased to $215.6 million from $264.4 million at August 31, 2010. Excluding accounts receivable and the associated net revenue for Apollo Global, the Company's days sales outstanding ("DSO") was 23 days at August 31, 2011, compared to 30 days at August 31, 2010. The decrease in DSO versus a year ago was primarily attributable to reductions in gross accounts receivable as a result of decreases in University of Phoenix enrollment, a shift in the mix of students from Associates to higher degree-level programs, and improvements in student retention rates, partially due to the full implementation of University Orientation. Improved collection rates at University of Phoenix, which were favorably impacted by ongoing process improvements, also contributed to the decrease.
 
Total debt outstanding (including short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt) increased by $14.6 million to $599.0 million at August 31, 2011, from $584.4 million at August 31, 2010. Subsequent to August 31, 2011, the Company repaid $390.1 million of the amount drawn on its revolving credit facility.
Share Repurchases
The Company repurchased approximately 7.7 million and 18.3 million shares of its Class A common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $46.16 and $42.30 per share for a total expenditure of $357.0 million and $775.8 million during the three months and year ended August 31, 2011, respectively. As of August 31, 2011, approximately $0.7 million remained available under the Company's current share repurchase authorization. Subsequent to quarter end, the Board of Directors increased authorization for management to repurchase Class A common shares to the current total amount of $500 million.
Business Outlook
The Company offers the following commentary regarding the outlook for fiscal 2012 based on the business trends observed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, as well as management's current expectations of future trends. The outlook reflects the acquisition of Carnegie Learning, Inc.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
This press release and the related conference call contain non-GAAP financial measures, which are intended to supplement, but not substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Management uses, and chooses to disclose to investors, these non-GAAP financial measures because (i) such measures provide an additional analytical tool to clarify the Company's results from operations and help to identify underlying trends in its results of operations; (ii) as to the non-GAAP earnings measures, such measures help compare the Company's performance on a consistent basis across time periods; and (iii) these non-GAAP measures are employed by the Company's management in its own evaluation of performance and are utilized in financial and operational decision-making processes, such as budgeting and forecasting. Exclusion of items in the non-GAAP presentation should not be construed as an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Other companies, including other companies in the education industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure across companies.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
On Thursday, November 17, Universidad de Artes, Ciencias y Comunicacin ("UNIACC"), an arts and communications university based in Santiago, Chile owned and operated by an indirect majority-owned subsidiary of Apollo Group, Inc., was advised by the National Accreditation Commission of Chile that its institutional accreditation would not be renewed. UNIACC is seeking clarification and evaluating the circumstances pending receipt of the formal notice and detailed description of the basis for the action. UNIACC expects to appeal the decision. The loss of accreditation from the National Accreditation Commission would not impact UNIACC's ability to operate or confer degrees and would not directly affect UNIACC's programmatic accreditations. However, without this institutional accreditation, government scholarship and student loan programs would not be available to new students enrolled after a final adverse determination in the appeals process.
For Apollo Group's fiscal year ended August 31, 2011, UNIACC generated $27 million of revenue and experienced an operating loss of $13 million. Approximately 30% of UNIACC's revenue in fiscal 2011 was derived from some form of governmental assistance that would no longer be available to new students without the accreditation by the National Accreditation Commission.
Additionally, as of August 31, 2011, Apollo Group had recorded approximately $21 million of goodwill and intangible assets on its balance sheet related to UNIAAC. Apollo Group is assessing whether an impairment of UNIACC's assets has occurred, which impairment, if any, would be reflected in Apollo Group's fiscal 2012 first quarter financial results.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e) Material Compensatory Plan, Contract or Arrangement.
On November 22, 2011, the Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors of Apollo Group, Inc. (the "Company") approved the terms of the 2012 fiscal year bonus plan under the Company's Executive Officer Incentive Performance Bonus Plan (the "2012 Plan"). The key features of the 2012 Plan may be summarized as follows:
Approval of 2012 Fiscal Year Executive Officer Bonus Plan.
All of the Company's executive officers will be eligible to participate in the 2012 Plan, including the following individuals, who are the named executive officers in the Company's Shareholders Information Statement dated December 21, 2010 and filed on Schedule 14C with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 21, 2010:
Participants.
 
For Dr. Sperling and Messrs. Edelstein, Cappelli and D'Amico, the target bonus opportunity was set at 100% of their annual base salary, and for Mr. Swartz and Dr. Pepicello, the target bonus was set at 75%. Annual base salary will be weighted to reflect any salary adjustments effected during the 2012 fiscal year, but in no event will the bonus amount paid to any participant exceed Five Million Dollars ($5,000,0000).
. The Compensation Committee established five separate performance goals under the 2012 Plan.
Performance Goals
        The first goal, weighted sixty percent (60%) for purposes of determining the potential cash bonus amount for each participant, is tied to the Company's operating income for the 2012 fiscal year. The Company's operating income will be determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") on a consolidated basis but will be subject to certain pre-established exclusions and adjustments approved by the Compensation Committee for such fiscal year. The following levels of threshold, target and maximum attainment of the operating income performance goal for the 2012 fiscal year have been set by the Compensation Committee.
 
        The second performance goal, weighted ten percent (10%), is tied to the Company's net revenue for the 2012 fiscal year. The Company's revenue will be determined in accordance with GAAP on a consolidated basis but will be subject to certain pre-established exclusions and adjustments approved by the Compensation Committee for such fiscal year. The following levels of threshold, target and maximum attainment of the net revenue performance goal for the 2012 fiscal year have been set by the Compensation Committee:
 
Note that the threshold, target and maximum levels of operating income and revenue stated above are applicable solely for purposes of determining the potential bonus amounts payable per 2012 plan participant. The goals at those specified levels are subject to certain non-GAAP adjustments and add-backs, including an add-back of the amounts paid under the 2012 plan as well as any profit sharing distribution made to the Company's employees for the 2012 fiscal year, that will not be taken into account in the calculation of the Company's revenue and operating income for the 2012 fiscal year that will be reportable in the Company's financial statements for that year. In addition, certain levels represent "stretch goals" intended to provide an incentive for plan participants to achieve a more challenging level of financial performance in order to qualify for the maximum bonus amount payable under the 2012 plan. For the foregoing reasons, the levels set under the 2012 plan are not intended to serve as guidance to the market as to the Company's expected levels of revenue and operating income for the 2012 fiscal year, nor are they intended in any way to modify or alter the existing outlook the Company has provided the market with respect to projected financial results for the 2012 fiscal year.
        The third performance goal, weighted ten percent (10%), will be measured in terms of independently-conducted surveys of University of Phoenix ("UOPX") students addressing a particular measure of student satisfaction. Actual goal attainment will be assessed in terms of the percentage of responding UOPX students who score the measured item favorably, as averaged on the basis of the responses submitted in each of the quarterly surveys conducted over the last three fiscal quarters of the 2012 fiscal year. The Compensation Committee has set specific percentages, as averaged over the three surveyed fiscal quarters, for purposes of measuring performance goal attainment at threshold, target and maximum levels.
        The fourth performance goal, weighted ten percent (10%), will be measured in terms of independently-conducted surveys, one addressing three particular measures of UOPX faculty engagement at the University and the other addressing three particular measurers of Company-wide employee engagement. Actual goal attainment will be assessed in terms of the average of (i) the aggregated percentage of responding UOPX faculty members who score the three measured items favorably and (ii) the aggregated percentage of responding Company employees who score their three measured items favorably. The aggregated percentage of favorable responses received for the three measured items in the faculty engagement survey will be added to the aggregated percentage of favorable responses received for the three measured items in the employee engagement survey, and the combined aggregated percentages will then be divided by two to determine the average aggregated percentage of such favorable responses. The Compensation Committee has set specific threshold, target and maximum levels for such average aggregated percentage.
        The fifth and final performance goal, weighted ten percent (10%), will be measured in terms of the improvement made by the individual UOPX campuses in (i) responding to student concerns on a timely basis at the campus point of origin and (ii) responding on a timely basis to external agents or agencies addressing individual student concerns and complaints. Specific levels of attainment have been set for threshold, target and maximum levels.
The potential cash incentive payable to each participant will be based on the actual attained level of each performance goal. Accordingly, the percentage of the target bonus amount assigned to each performance goal will be multiplied by the applicable factor (ranging from 0.5 at threshold to 2.0 at maximum level attainment). Should a performance goal be attained at a level between threshold and target or between target and maximum, then the applicable factor for the calculation of the potential cash bonus amount attributable to that performance goal shall be interpolated between those two levels on a straight linear basis.
Potential Cash Incentive Payment.
The cash bonus amount calculated for each participant on the basis of the attained levels of the five performance goals may be reduced by the Compensation Committee by up to thirty percent (30%) in the event the Committee determine that such a reduction is warranted based on its overall assessment of company and individual performance.
Actual Cash Incentive Payment.
The actual bonus attributable to the attainment of the 2012 fiscal year performance goals will be paid to each participant who continues in the Company's employ through the end of the 2012 fiscal year. In addition, pro-rated bonuses will be paid to participants who do not complete the applicable service requirement by reason of death or disability.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
On Monday, December 12, 2011, Apollo Group, Inc. received a request from Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, the Ranking Member of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, requesting copies of compensation agreements for our senior executives. Separately, Rep. Cummings announced that similar letters were sent to 13 for-profit schools as part of an effort to determine if the compensation of senior executives is appropriately tied to the performance of the students educated by the schools.
As a publicly-traded company, we report detailed information about executive compensation in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the exhibits to our annual reports on Form 10-K and in our definitive information statements on Schedule 14C, all of which are publicly available. We believe that a substantial portion of the requested information is included in these filings. We intend to cooperate fully with Rep. Cummings to provide any necessary additional information.

The terms of the Employment Agreement (or any other agreement between you and the Company, including any outstanding equity award agreements) that are not expressly modified or superseded by the terms of this letter agreement (the "") will remain unmodified and continue in full force and effect until their designated termination or expiration dates. The capitalized terms used in this Transition Agreement, to the extent not defined herein, will have the meanings assigned to them in the Employment Agreement.
Company
Employment Agreement
Transition Agreement
1. . You will remain in full-time employment with the Company until the of (a) August 26, 2012 or (b) the date on which your employment is sooner terminated under Section 2 below. Unless your full-time employment with the Company is otherwise sooner terminated under Section 2 below, you will continue as the Company's Co-Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Company's Board of Directors until the close of business on August 26, 2012.
Continued Full-Time Employment

For purposes of the current cash incentive plan in effect for the Company's executive officers for the 2012 fiscal year (the ""), you will be deemed to satisfy the one-year service requirement upon your continuation in the Company's employ through the close of the 2012 fiscal year, whether as a full-time employee under your Employment Agreement through August 26, 2012 or pursuant to your part-time employment arrangement commencing August 27, 2012 under this Transition Agreement. The actual bonus amount payable to you under the FY 2012 Annual Incentive Plan upon such satisfaction of the service requirement will be dependent upon (i) the level at which the applicable performance goals are attained and (ii) the degree to which the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors exercises the negative discretion it has reserved under the FY 2012 Annual Incentive Plan. Any such exercise of negative discretion will be applied on a uniform basis to you and the other executive officers of the Company participating in the FY 2012 Annual Incentive Plan.
FY 2012 Annual Incentive Plan
2. . Your full-time employment with the Company will continue through August 26, 2012, unless prior to such date: (a) the Company terminates your employment for Cause, (b) your employment terminates by reason of your death or Disability, (c) the Company terminates your employment for any reason other than for Cause or (d) you terminate your employment with or without Good Reason. Should your employment terminate for any of the foregoing reasons prior to August 26, 2012, the provisions of your Employment Agreement will govern any rights or entitlement you may have with respect to your outstanding equity awards and any other additional severance benefits, including any potential severance benefits under Section 8 of your Employment Agreement.
Termination of Full-Time Employment
This Transition Agreement shall constitute the "Notice of Non-Renewal" required by Section 1 of the Employment Agreement, and no further notice of non-renewal shall be required. Accordingly, unless sooner terminated, your employment pursuant to the terms of the Employment Agreement will be deemed to have been terminated by the Company, by reason of the foregoing non-renewal notice, effective as of the close of business on August 26, 2012, and you will therefore become entitled to receive the severance compensation described in Section 8(b) of the Employment Agreement, subject to the conditions described therein and in Section 5 of this Transition Agreement.
Upon the termination of your Employment Agreement on August 26, 2012, you will immediately resign as the Company's Co-Chief Executive Officer and will not hold any other officer positions with the Company, and you will also as of such date immediately resign from the Company's Board of Directors.
Following the date of such resignations, you will no longer be subject to the insider reporting and trading restrictions under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent that you engage in a non-exempt transaction in the Company's Class A common stock following your resignation date that is matchable against an opposite-way non-exempt transaction in such stock in which you engaged within the preceding six (6) months while still in executive officer status.
You will, during your period of part-time employment with the Company pursuant to this Transition Agreement, continue to be a restricted person subject to the Company's insider trader policy.
3. . Unless your employment with the Company terminates earlier pursuant to Section 2 above, effective August 27, 2012 you will become a part-time employee of the Company, and your commitment will be permanently reduced to a level less than 20% of the average level of services provided by you during the three (3)-year period preceding your conversion to such part-time status. Accordingly, you will only be required to work, and you will only work, thirty (30) hours per month during the term of your part-time employment arrangement hereunder. Your part-time employment with the Company as described below will continue through February 28, 2013, unless sooner terminated by reason of (i) your election to terminate such arrangement upon three (3) business days prior written notice to the Company, (ii) your death or Disability or (iii) the Company's immediate termination of your part-time employment for Cause (except that for purposes of this Section 3, the definition of "Cause" in Section 7(b)(i) of the Employment Agreement shall be revised to delete clauses (F), (G) and (H) from such definition since those terms are only applicable to you in your former position as Co-Chief Executive Officer). Upon the termination of your part-time employment with the Company, you will no longer render any services in any capacity to the Company or any of its affiliates.
Conversion to Part-Time Employment
The following provisions will govern your period of parttime employment:

For any partial calendar month during your period of part-time employment, both your rate of monthly salary and work hour requirement will be appropriately pro-rated. You will be paid your monthly salary in one or more increments each month in accordance with the regular pay periods for the Company's other salaried employees. Each payment will be subject to the Company's collection of all applicable withholding taxes. In no event will any compensation you earn for service in any calendar year within your part-time employment period be paid later than March 15 of the succeeding calendar year.
(e) You will be eligible to participate in any of the Company's employee benefit plans, including the group health plans, the term insurance and disability plans, the non-qualified deferred compensation and profit-sharing plans and the employee stock purchase plan, and you will accrue any vacation pay during you period of part-time employment.

To obtain reimbursement for your expenses hereunder, you
must submit appropriate evidence of each such expense within thirty (30) days after the of (i) your incurrence of that expense or (ii) your receipt of the invoice or billing statement for such expense, and the Company shall provide you with the requisite reimbursement within ten (10) business days thereafter; provided, however, that no expense will be reimbursed later than the close of the calendar year following the calendar year in which that expense is incurred. The amount eligible for reimbursement hereunder in any calendar year during your period of part-time employment will not affect the amount eligible for reimbursement hereunder during any other calendar year, and you may not exchange or liquidate your right to reimbursements hereunder for any other payment or benefit.
later
(h) For the avoidance of doubt, the Company agrees that pursuant to Section 16 of the Employment Agreement you will be indemnified, defended, and held harmless from and against any and all claims and/or liability arising from, as a result of, or in connection with your service as a part-time employee to the same extent as you were indemnified, defended, and held harmless in connection with your service as Co-Chief Executive Officer.
4. . Assuming your service under the Employment Agreement continues until August 26, 2012, your coverage under the Company's health care plans will terminate on August 31, 2012 as a result of your conversion to limited part-time employee status on August 27, 2012. Pursuant to the provisions of Section 8(b)(iii) of the Employment Agreement, you will be entitled to reimbursement of your COBRA coverage costs for the period of coverage commencing September 1, 2012 and continuing until the to occur of (i) eighteen (18) months of such reimbursed COBRA coverage costs, (ii) the date you are no longer eligible for COBRA coverage or (iii) the date you become eligible for COBRA coverage under a successor employer health care plan (as to which event you shall provide the Company with written notice within ten (10) calendar days). The reimbursement of your COBRA coverage costs will be governed by the express terms and conditions of Section 8(b)(iii) of the Employment Agreement, and nothing in this Transition Agreement shall modify, alter or supersede those terms and conditions.
COBRA Coverage
earliest
5. . Should (i) your employment with the Company terminate prior to August 26, 2012 by reason of a unilateral termination effected by the Company for any reason other than Cause, death or Disability or by reason of your resignation for Good Reason or (ii) your employment pursuant to the terms of the Employment Agreement terminates at the close of business on August 26, 2012 by reason of the Notice of Non-Renewal provided in Section 2 of this Transition Agreement, then you will be entitled to receive the Accrued Obligations and the severance compensation described in Section 8(b) of the Employment Agreement, subject to the conditions described therein and in this Section 5 and payable in accordance with the terms of the Employment Agreement. For avoidance of doubt, you and the Company agree that such severance compensation under Section 8(b) of the Employment Agreement consists of the following:
Severance Package
 
Although Section 8(b)(ii) of the Employment Agreement also provides for one hundred percent accelerated vesting of both your Initial RSU Award and Supplemental Award, you hereby acknowledge that those two awards have already vested in full, and the vesting acceleration provisions of your Employment Agreement are no longer applicable to those two awards.
The reimbursement of COBRA coverage costs to which you are entitled under Section 8(b)(iii) of the Employment Agreement will be satisfied through the reimbursement arrangement set forth in Section 4 of this Transition Agreement.
As a condition to your right to receive the Cash Severance Benefit, you must execute and deliver to the Company a general release in the form of attached Exhibit A to this Transition Agreement, with such release to be dated February 21, 2013, and such release must become effective and enforceable by you not revoking it within the seven (7)-day period in which you have to revoke it after signing. You must also continue to comply with the restrictive covenants set forth in Section 10 of the Employment Agreement.
Each payment of your Cash Severance Benefit will be subject to the Company's collection of all applicable withholding taxes, and you will only receive the net amount remaining after such taxes have been withheld.
The fact that for the avoidance of doubt certain severance terms have been explicitly set forth above shall not affect any rights you may have in the event the Employment Agreement terminates prior to August 26, 2012 because of your death or Disability.
6. . Your Initial Option Grant covering 1,000,000 shares of the Company's Class A common stock will remain outstanding during the period of your part-time employment. Pursuant to the terms of the grant agreement for your Initial Option Grant, you will have a three (3)-month period measured from the date on which your employment with the Company terminates in which to exercise your Initial Option Grant (or twelve (12)-month in the event your employment terminates by reason of death or Disability), but in no event may your Initial Option Grant be exercised after the expiration date of the maximum six (6)-year option term. Accordingly, if your period of part-time employment pursuant to this Transition Agreement continues until the scheduled February 28, 2013 termination date, you will have a three-month period measured from that date (i.e., until May 27, 2013) in which to exercise the outstanding balance of your Initial Option Grant. Should (i) the Company terminate your employment under the Employment Agreement for any reason other than Cause, death or Disability prior to August 26, 2012 or (ii) you resign for Good Reason under the Employment Agreement before August 26, 2012, then the period for exercising your Initial Option Grant will automatically be extended until the close of business on May 27, 2013.
Exercise Period Following Termination of Employment
7. . You will continue to be entitled to the 409A Tax Goss-Up Payment protection provided pursuant to Section 14(c) of the Employment Agreement to the extent you incur a penalty tax under Code Section 409A with respect to the compensation arrangements in effect for you under the Employment Agreement or otherwise implemented in connection with your service as a full-time employee through the August 26, 2012 termination date of the Employment Agreement. Such 409A Tax Gross-Up Payment protection provided
Partial Waiver of Section 409A Gross-Up
by Section 14(c) of the Employment Agreement will survive the termination of that agreement.

.
Waiver and Release
(a) Except as set forth in Section 2(b), which identifies claims expressly excluded from this release, Executive hereby releases the Company, all affiliated companies, and their respective officers, directors, agents, employees, stockholders, successors and assigns from any and all claims, liabilities, demands, causes of action, costs, expenses, attorney fees, damages, indemnities and obligations of every kind and nature, in law, equity or otherwise, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising from or relating to Executive's employment with the Company through the date of this Agreement and the termination of his full-time employment with the Company and his executive officer positions on August 26, 2012, including (without limitation): claims of wrongful discharge, emotional distress, defamation, fraud, breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, discrimination claims based on sex, age, race, national origin, disability or any other basis under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended (""), the Americans with Disability Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as amended, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, as amended, and any similar law of any state or governmental entity, any contract claims, tort claims and wage or benefit claims, including (without limitation) claims for salary, bonuses, commissions, equity awards (including stock grants, stock options and restricted stock units), vesting acceleration, vacation pay, fringe benefits, severance pay or any other form of compensation.
ADEA
(b) The only claims that Executive is not waiving and releasing under this Agreement are claims he may have for (1) unemployment, state disability, worker's compensation, and/or paid family leave insurance benefits pursuant to the terms of applicable state law; (2) continued coverage under the Company-sponsored group health benefit plans pursuant to his rights under the federal law known as "COBRA" and/or under an applicable state law counterpart(s); (3) any benefits entitlements that are vested and unpaid as of his termination date pursuant to the terms of a Company-sponsored benefit plan; (4) any benefits or rights to which he is entitled pursuant to Section 8 of the Employment Agreement or pursuant to the terms of his presently-outstanding equity awards from the Company, including the post-employment exercise rights set forth in Section 6 of the Transition Agreement, or his rights to indemnification pursuant to Section 16 of the Employment Agreement or his rights to certain tax gross-up payments pursuant to Section 14(c) of the Employment Agreement, subject to the modification set forth in Section 7 of the Transition Agreement, (5) violation of any federal state or local statutory

In addition, nothing in this Agreement prevents or prohibits Executive from filing a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or any other government agency that is responsible for enforcing a law on behalf of the government and deems such claims not waivable. However, because Executive is hereby waiving and releasing all claims "for monetary damages and any other form of personal relief" (per Section 2(a) above), he may only seek and receive non-personal forms of relief from the EEOC and similar government agencies.

Executive expressly acknowledges that this Agreement is intended to include, and does include in its effect, without limitation, all claims which Executive does not know or suspect to exist in his favor against the Company and/or any related persons at the moment of execution thereof, and that this Agreement expressly contemplates extinguishing all such claims.
(e) Executive understands and agrees that the Company has no obligation to provide him with any severance benefits under the Employment Agreement unless he executes this Agreement. Executive also understands that he has received or will receive, regardless of the execution of this Agreement, all wages and reimbursements owed to him, together with any accrued but unpaid vacation pay, less applicable withholdings and deductions, earned through the date of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect, impair or waive the Executive's right to receive any wages that become due and payable to him after the date of this Agreement by reason of his continued part-time employment pursuant to the Transition Agreement.
(f) This Agreement is binding on Executive, his heirs, legal representatives and assigns.
3. . This Agreement, the Employment Agreement and the Transition Agreement constitute the entire understanding and agreement between Executive and the Company in connection with the matters described, and replaces and cancels all previous agreements and commitments, whether spoken or written, with respect to such matters.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Phoenix, January 5, 2012  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or the "Company") today reported financial results for the three months ended November 30, 2011.
"Our strategic initiatives to further enhance the student experience and provide world-class student protections remain our focus," said Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer and Apollo Global Chairman Greg Cappelli. "We are also pleased to report positive new enrollment growth during the first quarter and improving trends in admissions advisor effectiveness, while reaching students who we believe can be successful in our degree programs."
Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer Chas Edelstein added, "During the first quarter, we continued to invest in areas that will further differentiate University of Phoenix and enhance the student experience. We believe the acquisition of Carnegie Learning will accelerate our efforts to incorporate adaptive learning technologies into our academic platform, which support our students' success in the classroom."
Unaudited First Quarter of Fiscal 2012 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 totaled $1,178.7 million, which represents an 11.1% decrease from the first quarter of fiscal 2011. This decrease was principally due to lower enrollments at University of Phoenix, which was partially offset by selective tuition price and other fee changes. For the quarter, University of Phoenix Degreed Enrollment decreased 14.8% to 373,100 compared with the prior year first quarter, primarily due to decreases in New Degreed Enrollment during fiscal 2011, which the Company believes were primarily the result of the operational changes and initiatives it implemented to more effectively support students and improve educational outcomes, as well as the broader competitive environment. University of Phoenix New Degreed Enrollment increased 12.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 compared with the prior year period.
The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended November 30, 2011, of $149.3 million, or $1.14 per share (130.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $236.0 million, or $1.61 per share (146.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended November 30, 2010. Results for the first quarters of fiscal 2012 and 2011 included a number of special items that are detailed below.
Results for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 included the following:
 
 
Results for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 included the following:
 
 
Excluding the items noted above, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended November 30, 2011, was $167.2 million, or $1.28 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $238.9 million, or $1.63 per share for the three months ended November 30, 2010. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Operating Expenses
Instructional and student advisory expenses increased by $1.0 million, or 0.2%, to $456.8 million for the three months ended November 30, 2011, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2010, which represents a 450 basis point increase as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in expense was primarily related to the Company's various initiatives, including technology, to more effectively support students and their educational outcomes. The expense associated with these initiatives includes costs incurred by Carnegie Learning and integration costs following this acquisition. Additionally, although the Company expects to realize future savings from its real estate rationalization plan, rent expense increased primarily due to the sale-leaseback of its principal office buildings in fiscal 2011.
Marketing expenses decreased by $0.3 million, or 0.2%, to $165.8 million for the three months ended November 30, 2011, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2010, which represents a 160 basis point increase as a percentage of net revenue. The increase as a percentage of net revenue was primarily the result of the decline in revenue, as well as an increase in costs principally attributable to efforts to establish relationships with select employers.
Admissions advisory expenses decreased by $12.4 million, or 10.9%, to $101.4 million for the three months ended November 30, 2011, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2010. As a percentage of net revenue, admissions advisory was consistent. The decrease in expense was a result of lower admissions advisory headcount which was partially attributable to a strategic reduction in force near the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The decrease was partially offset by higher average employee compensation costs.
General and administrative expenses decreased by $4.9 million, or 5.8%, to $79.9 million for the three months ended November 30, 2011, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2010, which represents a 40 basis point increase as a percentage of net revenue. The increase as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation expense.
Depreciation and amortization increased by $9.2 million, or 24.8%, to $46.3 million for the three months ended November 30, 2011, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2010, which represents a 110 basis point increase as a percentage of net revenue. The increase was principally attributable to increased capital expenditures in recent years related to information technology and $2.7 million of intangible asset amortization in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 as a result of the Carnegie Learning acquisition. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in amortization of BPP intangible assets and the absence of depreciation of the Company's principal office buildings for which the Company entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement in fiscal 2011.
The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable ("bad debt expense") decreased by $15.3 million, or 26.9%, to $41.6 million for the three months ended November 30, 2011, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2010, which represents an 80 basis point decrease as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in gross accounts receivable principally resulting from decreases in University of Phoenix Degreed Enrollment, a shift in the mix of students from Associates to Bachelors degree level programs, and the full implementation of University Orientation, which the Company believes has improved the student retention rate. Improved collection rates at University of Phoenix, which were favorably impacted by an initiative to address the Company's oldest receivables in fiscal 2011, also contributed to the decrease.
Financial and Operating Metrics
Below are Apollo Group's unaudited financial data and operating metrics for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 versus the prior year period.
 
 
Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of November 30, 2011, the Company's cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $1,201.0 million, compared to $1,571.7 million as of August 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to repayments on borrowings, share repurchases, the purchase of Carnegie Learning and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash generated from operations.
At November 30, 2011, accounts receivable increased to $250.9 million from $215.6 million at August 31, 2011. Excluding accounts receivable and the associated net revenue for Apollo Global, the Company's days sales outstanding ("DSO") was 24 days at November 30, 2011, compared to 23 days at August 31, 2011, and 26 days at November 30, 2010. The decrease in DSO versus a year ago was primarily attributable to reductions in gross accounts receivable principally resulting from decreases in University of Phoenix Degreed Enrollment, a shift in the mix of students from Associates to Bachelors degree level programs and the full implementation of University Orientation, which the Company believes has improved the student retention rate. Improved collection rates at University of Phoenix, which were favorably impacted by an initiative to address the Company's oldest receivables in fiscal 2011, also contributed to the decrease.
Total debt outstanding (including short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt) decreased by $484.7 million to $114.3 million at November 30, 2011, from $599.0 million at August 31, 2011. The decrease is due to the repayment of the borrowings on the Company's $500 million credit facility.
Share Repurchases
The Company repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares of its Class A common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $45.84 per share for a total expenditure of $78.2 million during the three months ended November 30, 2011. Subsequent to quarter-end and through December 31, 2011, the Company repurchased an additional 2.6 million shares of Class A common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $49.71 per share for a total expenditure of $128.3 million. As of December 31, 2011, approximately $293.5 million remained available under the Company's current share repurchase authorization.
Business Outlook
The Company offers the following commentary regarding the outlook for fiscal 2012 based on the business trends observed during the first quarter of fiscal 2012, as well as management's current expectations of future trends.

This press release and the related conference call contain non-GAAP financial measures, which are intended to supplement, but not substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

consistent basis across time periods; and (iii) these non-GAAP measures are employed by the Company's management in its own evaluation of performance and are utilized in financial and operational decision-making processes, such as budgeting and forecasting. Exclusion of items in the non-GAAP presentation should not be construed as an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Other companies, including other companies in the education industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure across companies.

Exhibit 99.1
PHOENIX, Feb. 2, 2012  University of Phoenix today announced key findings from its fourth Academic Annual Report, illustrating its commitment to higher education fueled by constant innovation. The report shows an increase in modified graduation rates for associate students and positive student satisfaction. University of Phoenix is consistently working to build degree programs that directly address the shifting economic needs of a skilled workforce and the academic challenges faced by working learners.
"Education must evolve to help students succeed in the 21
st
century economy, and University of Phoenix is at the forefront of this movement," said Dr. William J. Pepicello, president of University of Phoenix. "For more than three decades we have been drivers of innovation within higher education by developing adaptive methodologies that help our students achieve their educational and professional goals. This Academic Annual Report is our own report card, providing a transparent measurement of how well we are serving our students' needs and guiding our continuous improvement."
Key Findings
University of Phoenix's degree graduation rate is assessed by the federal government's Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). The University modified graduation rate, which takes into account the entire University student body, is defined as the percentage of students who completed at least three credits and went on to be degree-complete within 150 percent of normal degree completion time. Data are collected on the number of students entering the institution as degree-seeking students in a particular cohort year.
Modified Graduation Rates:
University of Phoenix's modified graduation rates for associate degrees reported in 2011 were 34 percent for those graduating within three years and 36 percent within four years, up from 32 percent and 35 percent, respectively, reported in 2010. Bachelor's degree modified graduation rates declined from the 2010 Academic Annual Report to 31 percent for students who graduate within six years and 33 percent within eight years, both down by 3 percentage points in 2011. Most of the decline can be attributed to an increase in the number of students transferring in with zero credits.
At the master's level, University of Phoenix's modified graduation rate is 60 percent for students who graduate within three years and 64 percent within four years.
The University noted that the IPEDS methodology is designed to assess the progress of "traditional students"  those who go directly from high school and study on campus. These "traditional students" make up only 27 percent of the undergraduate population. Working adults and "non-traditional students" make up nearly three-fourths of the U.S. undergraduate population and comprise the majority of the University's student body. IPEDS only considers
"first-time" college students who complete their entire college program at the same institution. However, many University of Phoenix students enter the University with transfer credits from other institutions.
The University regularly conducts student satisfaction surveys and uses the results to implement change within the school. At the end of each course, the University surveys student satisfaction with the University overall, their instructor, the feedback the instructor provided, the curriculum, and their learning experience. In surveys conducted for the 2011 academic year, using a 10-point scale, students rated all five categories higher than an eight. Additionally, indicate that students feel their experience at the University was a positive one in all services. The University also uses an external measure of student satisfaction, the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE).
Student Satisfaction:
End-of-Program Surveys
Using the Standardized Assessment of Information Literacy Skills (SAILS) methodology, University of Phoenix senior students compared favorably to senior students at similar institutions in all categories.
Information Literacy:
University of Phoenix senior students slightly underperformed senior students at other institutions, according to the ETS Proficiency Profile (EPP), which measures students' academic proficiency and progress.
Academic Proficiency and Progress:
Many University of Phoenix students are employed full time while enrolled. Internal research shows that University of Phoenix students' average annual salaries while they are enrolled in their program of study increase at higher rates than the overall national average salary increase.
Student Salary Increase:
Continuous Improvement
In November 2010, a free University Orientation workshop was implemented to ensure that students with limited prior college experience better understand the time and effort required to be successful in University programs prior to actually enrolling in the University. University Orientation is three weeks long and delivered in the same format as existing classes. Students must complete assignments in a manner similar to the way they will be working in class. Of those who start University Orientation, approximately 80 percent enroll in the University of Phoenix, while approximately 20 percent opt out before incurring any debt. Students who opt out are generally leaving with a positive experience. For students who went through University Orientation and then enrolled in the University, first-course completion rates were higher than prior-year levels.
Some of this retention success can be attributed to the First-Year Sequence. The First-Year Sequence was introduced in February 2010. The First-Year Sequence was designed using a laddering approach to the sequence of courses. Concepts and skills introduced in early classes are reinforced with work in later classes.
University of Phoenix's student body remains diverse; as an example, 18 percent are African American, compared to a national average of 12 percent. Additionally, female students make up two-thirds of the total enrollment at University of Phoenix, as opposed to a little over half of the overall enrollment in colleges and universities nationwide.
Diversity:
In addition, the University's more than 35,000 faculty members are more diverse than national averages for American colleges and universities. One-third of University of Phoenix's faculty is non-white. More than 18 percent of University of Phoenix's faculty is African American, compared to an average of over 6 percent at universities nationwide. Women now make up more than half of University of Phoenix's faculty. The percentage of female faculty at University of Phoenix rose to 57 percent in 2011 from almost 54 percent in 2010. In comparison, female faculty members make up approximately 47 percent of the post-secondary instructional population nationally.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY As technology becomes more embedded in our daily lives, higher education must adapt and evolve to keep pace. Access to information has been democratized through technological innovation while much of academia continues to cling to traditional conventions of closed sources of information. The way people work and play have changed, but the way students are expected to learn, for the most part, has not. More to the point, however, is that higher education is charged with preparing the next generation to work in a world that differs greatly from what was expected of workers in the Manufacturing Age. The current structure of higher education generally lacks the flexibility to adapt to today's economic environment. Many traditional systems are not nimble when attempting to implement new curriculum, new courses of study, or innovative technologies. Standing in the way of integrating e-learning are obstacles that include monetary considerations and the concept that e-learning is for distance education only. These must be overcome. Technology enables more engaged learning and increased access. Classrooms that truly prepare students for the new workplace must include blended learninga combination of face to face and technology. What is absolutely critical to the classroom today is a move from a teaching focus to a learning focus. This can be accomplished in a technology-enhanced environment. The challenge lies not in change per se, but in the rational implementation of transformation in ways that allow for an evolutionary rather than a revolutionary execution. The key to implementing e-learning and getting buy-in from faculty and students alike is to ensure that the integration is properly planned. Faculty need adequate training and support that goes beyond a hot- line to call when systems are down. Students need to understand how to evaluate websites and information as well as how to organize their knowledge. And most importantly, students must be skilled critical thinkers. The evolution of University of Phoenix has been inextricably linked with advances in technology from the introduction of the online campus in 1989 to the numerous technology-enhanced academic assets and student services available 24/7 anywhere Internet access is available. The discussion concerning integrating technology concludes by looking forward for what is to come next at the University the untapped potential of ambient intelligence and adaptive learning. The Scorecard section of the report details how University of Phoenix students compare demographically, as well as academically with their peers at other like institutions nationally. As in past years, the University's students rate their experience to be positive in all surveyed areas as reported on End-of-Course, End-of-Program, and Alumni surveys. This includes the quality of faculty, curriculum, and services. This year's results of the Standardized Assessment of Information Literacy Skills (SAILS), University seniors are equivalent in all eight areas as compared to seniors at other institutions. In addition, University of Phoenix seniors outperform or are equivalent to University of Phoenix freshmen in all eight areas. The ETSProficiency Profile showed a slight decline in seniors' performance to the comparison group. However, the differences between the two groups were slight and of limited significance. Finally, the graduation rates for University associate and master levels show an increase; the bachelor level declined. The University believes most of the decline can be attributed to an increase in the number of students transferring in with zero credits. 1
 
WHY HIGHER EDUCATION MUST CHANGE
Realizing the need for accessible, quality higher education that could attend to the way many prospective students lived their lives, Dr. John Sperling created University of Phoenix, a new and somewhat unorthodox approach to higher education that catered to the adult student who worked and could not attend classes during the day. Today the unorthodox has become commonplace and a new need exists, one that requires higher education to innovate and renovate to match the way our students live, and beyond that, mirror how society currently functions.
Higher education stands as a monolith in a dynamic, rapidly evolving society in which access to information has been democratized through technological innovation while much of academia clings to traditional conventions of closed sources of information. The way people work and play have changed, but the way students are expected to learn, for the most part, has not.
For academic institutions, charged with equipping graduates to compete in today's knowledge economy, the possibilities are great. Distance education, sophisticated learning-management systems and the opportunity to collaborate with research partners from around the world are just some of the transformational benefits that universities are embracing.
"The Future of Higher Education: How Technology Will Shape Learning" The Economist 2008
The skills required for today's Information Age workplace are far different than they were in the Manufacturing Age. Today's students must be prepared to work in a world that expects them to be globally aware, have financial and entrepreneurial literacy, and be information and media savvy. To accomplish that, they must be innovative and creative and have honed their abilities in critical thinking and problem solving, along with being self-directed, adaptable, and accountable.1 The traditional classroom is not designed to encourage the development of these skills.
The current structure of higher education for the most part, lacks the flexibility to adapt to today's economic environment. Traditional systems frequently are not nimble when attempting to implement new curriculum, new courses of study, or innovative technologies. In addition, higher education is severely hampered by the economic environment of our countrymost notably a lack of funding. This causes major issues for public institutions relying on state subsidies and funding. Private institutions have also seen a major decrease in donations and alumni support. Reduced funding translates into a lack of flexibility that in turn limits any desired scalability or meaningful reform.
Impediments to Integrating e-Learning
In addition to monetary considerations, other factors can impede the integration of e-learning. One is the perception that e-learning is for distance education only. In fact, e-learning is for all students. As noted in a study by Apple Corporation, "Apple Classrooms of Tomorrow  Today: Learning in the 21st Century,"2 we are at the "confluence of three influences." These include:
 -  Globalization
 -  Interdependence and competition
 -  Technology innovations in education
 
According to the report, technology enables more engaged learning and increased access. If this is so, why would those advantages be limited only to those engaging in distance learning? The classrooms of the 21st-century must include blended learning at every level.
The Apple report suggests the following six design principles for 21st century education, noting that these principles can best be accomplished with the addition of technology:
 -  Skills outcomes
 -  Relevant and applied curriculum
 -  Informative assessments
 -  Social and emotional connection
 -  Culture of creativity and innovation
 -  24/7 access to tools and resources
To educate effectively a larger number of Americans than are being educated today, education must focus on all students, not just those who are currently succeeding. In an article titled "Failure Is Not an Option," Dr. David Edyburn of the University of Wisconsin questions, "How long do we let students fail at given tasks before we get them appropriate performance support tools?"3 And while the focus on learning outcomes is usually on the positives, failure at learning tasks also produces outcomes but not the kind the institution or the student want. Too often, Dr. Edyburn suggests, the current perception is biased in favor of "naked independence."4 This refers to those students or people who can perform without assistance, and we devalue those who need the assistance in order to succeed. This is particularly evident in the sciences
and math, where we find much reluctance to allow technology into the classrooms to assist students, while the use of grammar and spell checkers is seen as totally appropriate. Dr. Edyburn concludes that "the definition of fairness is everyone gets what they need. Technology offers viable options to enhance performance by providing cognitive supports and appropriate tools."
It is insufficient for learners to merely attain concepts in isolation, yielding knowledge that frequently remains static. Rather, students must form and continually adapt their understanding of the world as they collaborate with other students to solve authentic problems presented in meaningful tasks.
Teaching Constructivist Science, Bentley, Ebert, & Ebert, 2007
If this situation is to change, traditional beliefs such as "naked independence," and what defines an educated person, will have to be challenged. Colleges and universities can no longer remain one dimensional repositories of knowledge in a three-dimensional world. They must evolve to a place where students can acquire knowledge and skills they can use to solve complex problems for the rest of their lives.5 Traditional models and roles, including the role of the faculty, will need to be re-examined.
 
Many faculty members continue to view their roles as being the locus of knowledge transfer through teaching. Many continue to believe the lecture/mid-term/final format to be an immutable standard. However, increasingly there are those who feel not only that this one-size academia does not _t all students but also is actually archaic.
the crucial element in blended learning is an appropriate balance of face-to-face teaching and technology use. Neither the computer nor the World Wide Web is meant to replace instructor both are supplements to instructor-developed lesson plans, but technology can provide a myriad of benefits including the development of independent learners, a source of instant feedback, and motivation to learners.
Blended Learning: Using technology in and beyond the language classroom, Pete Sharma and Barney Barrett 2007
Dr. Joe Redish of the University of Maryland has conducted research on the changes that need to be made to the way college students are taught. He posits that the roots of the lecture go back thousands of years. And before printing was widespread, "someone would read the books" while the listeners would copy down what was read. Professor Redish also points out that, "the word lecture comes from the Latin word meaning to read.'"6 Dr. Redish recounts that his lecture-style classes reached only those "who do really well and are motivated," so he began to seek ways to reach the students who weren't teaching themselves.7 Dr. Redish and other like-minded academics took note of the work cognitive scientists were doing that indicated people's shortterm memories were limited and could not absorb and retain all the information presented in lecture format.8 And this may be particularly true for those students who have grown up in a world of immediacy.
What is absolutely critical to the classroom today is to move from a teaching focus to a learning focus. This can be accomplished in a technology-enhanced environment. If Amazon can employ a platform that adapts to its users and anticipates their preferences, why can't educational platforms, which by doing so could reach a larger percentage of students? The challenge lies not in change, per se, but in the rational implementation of transformation in ways that allow for an evolutionary rather than a revolutionary execution.
Faculty members need to be reassured that technology is merely a tool. It is not intended to be a replacement; it is meant to empower them and to assist the student to excel. Research reported in the article, "Bring Academics On Board," reveals a range of pedagogical motivations for the development of e-learning environments, which, perhaps not surprisingly, complement the six design principles outlined by the Apple report. These include the following:
 -  Catering more effectively to the learning needs of different student groups and learning styles
 -  Improving learning outcomes
 -  Improving retention and progression rates
 -  Challenging students to become learner centred [sic] , self-directed, resourceful and independent learners
4
 
 -  Engaging students in the learning experience
 -  Revitalising [sic] and re-energising [sic] the curriculum
 -  Providing a richer learning experience9
One way to build students cognitively is through creativity. Technology is widely accepted as a way for students to think more critically during learning. This critical thinking through technology gives students opportunities to think more creatively, therefore bolstering their higher order thinking skills. One method of having students accomplish this is through design.
"Creativity in Technology Education"
Singer Science and Business Media, T. Lewis, 2008
However, in spite of these findings, the authors report that many academics still believe that e-learning can cause "limited working memory, split attention, and cognitive overload that arise from multiple representations of content." 10 This combined with the "shiny object" fascination will diminish concentration on the core content and reduce learning.11 And while this research was done in Australia and may appear to be somewhat dated, it is still relevant to many in academia today.
In a 2010 article in The Chronicle of Higher Education,12 Marc Parry interviewed Nicholas Carr, former editor of the Harvard Business
Review and author of several articles and books debating the role of computers in business and the classroom. His list of publications includes articles such as "IT Doesn't Matter" and "Is Google Making Us Stupid?" His recent book, The Shallows, is a 2011 Pulitzer Prize nominee and a New York Times bestseller. Mr. Carr believes that the Internet is "rewiring our brains and short circuiting our ability to think" and that it can "impede understanding, comprehension, and learning." In addition, Carr makes an excellent point regarding Internet research indicating that when researching online using a search engine such as Google, results shown at the top are determined by popularity, not necessarily by relevance and reliability. Researchers using these resources could end up using the same materials and as a result, all coming to the same conclusions. Finally, and perhaps the most important point, Carr believes that unless properly planned, technology can keep people from "transferring information from short-term to long-term memory."
Properly Planned Integration
The key to both implementing e-learning and getting buy-in from faculty and students alike is to ensure that it is, as Carr referenced, "properly planned." To ensure that research is not purely surface study, students need to understand how to evaluate websites and information and to organize their knowledge. They must be skilled critical thinkers. Students must have access not only to Internet research, but also to libraries containing peer-reviewed works and books. They also need to be encouraged and led toward deep learning and reflection by the faculty through deep teaching. In addition, properly planned technology always has an academic purpose and application. If it does not, if it is merely a shiny object, the faculty and the students will ultimately reject it. Properly planned technology must be aligned with strong support systems. Technology implementation can happen only if 24/7 support is reliably available. And support does not simply mean the voice at the end of a phone line at the help desk. Support,
5
 
particularly for the faculty, includes giving faculty members the time necessary to learn the new technology and how it applies to what they are teaching. Support can also mean a dedicated team of researchers, software developers, and instructional designers who work with faculty members to ensure relevance and applicability.
Virtual classrooms must also change. Frequently, online courses are created using the same pedagogies and curriculum as are used in the traditional classroom. Often courses are simply taken verbatim and taught online. Much as writing for online reading differs both in style and design from that in print, online learning has distinctive characteristics and different methodologies and techniques; consequently, classroom management tools are required to create the proper environment.
Given the increasing evidence that Internet information and communication technologies are transforming much of society, there is little reason to believe that it will not be the defining transformative innovation for higher education in the 21st century Transformation of learning environments in higher education settings for an increasingly electronic world is critical to ensure that the benefits are fully realized.
"Learning on-line: A review of recent literature in a rapidly expanding field". Journal of Further and Higher Education
Christina Williams, University of Brighton, 2002
And finally, in a properly planned blended learning environment the students must have the option, much as we all do in our daily lives, of technology when they want it and face-to-face when they want . or need that. Many organizations do quite well blending bricks and mortar with online interaction. Banks provide the convenience of self-service for basic transactions. Electronic deposits are the norm today for paychecks. Today online banking and bill paying is available through all the main and even smaller banks. Yet, if banking customers have questions or need documentation and/or services that are not available online, they can and do visit their local bank to speak with a staff member. The public does not think of one bank as an "online bank" and another as a "bricks and mortar" institution. It is inconsistent that educators persist in thinking that educational opportunities must be defined in this either/or manner.
In short, higher education must adapt to our changing society and abandon the outdated myth that knowledge is a hidden truth locked up in the institution to be revealed only by faculty. Knowledge is everywhere and we must now provide responsible and accountable access to it or be prepared for the students to find that access elsewhere. Google and Wikipedia are providing unparalleled access to information that is or may be uneven in quality in many cases; our educational system needs to provide immediate access to the skills and knowledge on how to find, validate, and manage information.
ACADEMIC TECHNOLOGY AT UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX
As described in the opening paragraph, University of Phoenix was the product of the necessity to provide access to those who wanted to earn a degree, but who could not do so in the traditional system. Dr. Sperling recognized that in real life, designations like
 
"worker," "parent," and even "student" represented aspects of a seamless life in which these roles could and should coexist simultaneously and fluidly rather than as individual and walled facets that are each distinct and separate in their essence. Offering access to allow that coexistence was and is the goal of the University. And it is that mix of work, family, and education that is a daily reality for almost three-quarters of all students enrolled in institutions throughout the country today.
In 1989, University of Phoenix pioneered online education. It was innovative and controversial. Today, with the advent of the Internet, almost all colleges and universities offer at least some online instruction and many see it as a way into the future. In the mid-1990s, the University again sent waves through higher education by developing a virtual library, and by the start of the 21st century, had extended this digital approach to textbooks and supporting educational resources for students. Today, digitizing content is commonplace in higher education.
In order to have engaged learning, tasks need to be challenging, authentic, and multidisciplinary. Such tasks are typically complex and involve sustained amounts of time. They are authentic in that they correspond to the tasks in the home and workplaces of today and tomorrow. Collaboration around authentic tasks often takes place with peers and mentors within school as well as with family members and others in the real world outside of school. These tasks often require integrated instruction that incorporates problem-based learning and curriculum by project.
North Central Regional Educational Laboratory, 1994
Engaged Technology
The evolution of University of Phoenix has been inextricably linked with advances in technology. Computers and laptops are giving way to smartphones and tablets with previously unimagined capacities and capabilities. However, as Dr. Mark Weiser, Chief Technology Officer at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) understood as early as 1991: The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it. Say goodbye to your computerit's about to disappear. That is, it will be so much a part of your life that you won't even know it's there.13 Dr. Weiser's vision is close to reality in almost every aspect of life today and that's where the University intends to take our technology systems.
At the core of providing students with an engaged learning experience is the need to provide resources that support students' success and increase their ability to interact with the faculty and with their classmates. From the outset, University of Phoenix has worked hard to meet these challenges. Today technology is embedded throughout the students' experience. Of significance is the fact that technology enables a robust array of scalable, digital resources to all students and faculty members, regardless of their primary mode of delivery.
 
It is also significant to note that technology is not just an "add on," a tool to supplement traditional curriculum. Technology is a primary means of touching and developing students from initial contact and throughout their total education experience. An example of the former is the Phoenix Prep Center, which has correlates at many institutions. Prospective students interested in the Universityin any modalitycan sign on to the Phoenix Prep Center to learn about the University and about themselves. Interested users can take a variety of assessments that include learning styles, college readiness, and technology.
In addition, there are a number of virtual student support services, learning assets, and tools available to assist and support student development and success. For example, University of Phoenix utilizes a Student and Faculty Portal. All students and faculty have access to a portal which allows them to perform a multitude of administrative and support functions, and to access academic materials, learning assets, and tools. For students and instructors involved in classes via the online modality, the portal is the entry point for their classrooms. For students and faculty attending local campuses, the portal provides learning materials and forums for collaboration in Learning Teams and the ability to submit assignments and receive graded assignments with feedback from faculty between class meetings.
Students, regardless of the modality in which they are enrolled, can also do the following via the portal:
 -  Review contact information
 -  Register for classes
 -  Pay tuition
 -  Meet with a representative online
 -  Request transcripts
 -  Submit assignments
 -  Receive graded assignments with feedback
 -  Obtain grades
Workshops are also available via the student and faculty portal that students can take to improve their basic skills in areas important for student success. Student workshops in the following areas are offered on a weekly basis:
 -  Accounting and Finance
 -  Computer Skills
 -  Math and Statistics
 -  Personal Skills
 -  Writing
University of Phoenix faculty can access an online, automated Gradebook via the student and faculty portal. The Gradebook is customizable for each course based on the faculty member's assessments. Using the Gradebook, the faculty can organize and monitor assessments, allocate grade points, and provide private quantitative and qualitative feedback to students. The faculty can also set up and assign Learning Teams. All information for students (team assignments, feedback, grades, etc.) is immediately transmitted to them, and faculty members do not have to communicate separately via email or other media.
 
In addition, faculty members can notify the administration if they note that a student is not making satisfactory progress within a course through an automated Early Alert System. The faculty members fill out Early Alert Forms and these are automatically routed to notify the appropriate academic advisors to contact students to follow up on the issue immediately.
Technology also provides a means for the faculty to access ongoing personal and professional development. For example, ongoing faculty development is available both at the local campuses and online via the student and faculty portal. Faculty members can sign up for online workshops in course-specific areas, computer skills, and facilitation skills including critical thinking, faculty tone, and handling difficult students. Faculty members also have access to numerous administrative services via the portal, related to course management and University policies.
The types of technological enhancements just described represent more recent advances among many institutions. These now supplement what have become mainstays in higher education's technology arsenal, including virtual libraries, e-book collections (and other text materials), math and writing centers, and a variety of curriculum supplements such as simulations, virtual organizations, e-portfolios, and virtual science and computer labs. When taken in totality, technology now touches all aspect of the student experience, both inside and outside the classroom.
Notable in this regard is the introduction of social media as a means of connectivity in an education environment that comes closer to mirroring that of the society in general. This phenomenon is realized at University of Phoenix through PhoenixConnectsm, which is a closed academic network of students, faculty, and alumni. Research shows social and emotional connections affect students' perceptions of relevancy, and a lack of these connections can lead to disengagement.14 Through PhoenixConnectsm, students and faculty can discuss academic topics, meet new friends with similar interests, reach out to alumni, or launch a professional group.
In a similar vein, in April 2011 the Phoenix Mobile App joined the growing list of academic applications available on iTunes for students on the go. Students with iPads, iPhones, or Androids are able to post to online forums, receive alerts when grades are posted and when the instructor posts new information, and participate in discussion forums.
Looking Forward: The Untapped Potential of Technology
What we have discussed, while representing significant advances for higher education, only scratches the surface of what current technology can offer. There is much more to be adapted from the current technological playlist for the higher education community. The most important cumulative result is that technology has the potential to increase student engagement by creating a more personalized learning environment that can incorporate adaptive features. In other words, the student learning environment can be designed to respond to the specific student.

A major source of potential here lies in ambient intelligence, that is, technology that knows the users, serves them, responds to them, and does so unnoticed. Ambient intelligence, for example, is what makes possible Amazon's recognition of users and the type of products they are interested in, and thereby puts those in front of users as soon as they login, or perhaps even emails them with updates when new, like products arrive.

That serves you

This type of technology can be adapted to academic data sets in order to determine a student's learning profile and then adjust the learning environment to his or her needs. The more data points that can be gathered, the better the prescription is for learning. Determining the strengths and challenges of a student can then inform programs of skills enhancement, as well as appropriate levels and modes of content. In short, technology can make it possible to provide an individualized learning experience for every student.
Such technology not only serves the student directly, but also connects the student to faculty members in new ways, so they can mediate in a more deliberate manner than is currently possible. Faculty members will be able to see student information on online dashboards populated for each class. The information can include individual student needs and direct faculty members to resources to assist the students.
If courses are designed to include materials that are suited to different learning styles, faculty members no longer must teach to the middle of the class. Learning can and will adapt to each individual's needs. Faculty members will know what the students have learned and what they have missed. Faculty members can use this feedback in a variety of ways. For instance, they can assist the students in specifically identified areas of concern. They can also alter their approach to address areas in which a large number of students are showing deficiencies.
When this highly individualized and interactive learning experience is combined with social networking, new levels of interdisciplinary, inter-program, and inter-cohort dialogue and collaboration are possible. In short, adaptive technology can enhance the student's experience and it is expected to increase engagement and learning outcomes; however, technology is just the tool. The key to the successful utilization of technology is that it empowers faculty members to excel.

THE ACADEMIC SCORECARD
Summary of Results (Details in the Charts Below) University of Phoenix offers the following to its students:
 -  Associate of Arts degree with more than twenty concentrations
 -  Bachelor programs in Business, Management, Information Technology, Criminal Justice Administration, Security, Education, Nursing, Health Administration, Human Services, Communication, English, Psychology, and Environmental Science
 -  Master programs in Business Administration, Management, Public Administration, Accountancy, Information Systems, Justice and Security, Education, Nursing, Health Administration, Psychology, and Counseling
 -  Doctorate programs in Business Administration, Management, Health Administration, Education, Industrial/Organizational Psychology, and Nursing
University of Phoenix is regionally accredited by The Higher Learning Commission,15 a commission member of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. The University also has programmatic accreditations in nursing, counseling, education, and business.
University of Phoenix's commitment to diversity continues to be demonstrated in the ethnic diversity of its student demographics. Female students make up two thirds of the total enrollment, which is above national averages.
The ethnic diversity of the faculty at the University is greater than national averages. The majority of faculty members are women, again greater than national averages. As they have in previous years, students on End-of-Course, End-of-Program, and Alumni surveys rate their experiences to be positive in all surveyed areas, including quality of faculty, curriculum, and services.
Because University of Phoenix students did not participate this year in the National Survey of Student Engagement,16 2010 results are republished. For the questions that relate to the University's learning goals, seniors rated their satisfaction as greater on nine questions and the same as one question as compared to seniors at master's universities and colleges.
On the Standardized Assessment of Information Literacy Skills (SAILS),17 University of Phoenix seniors are equivalent in all eight areas compared to seniors at other institutions. University of Phoenix seniors outperform or are equivalent to University of Phoenix freshmen in all eight areas. These results are consistent with past years. The University's electronic library continues to grow. It now has over 105,000 periodicals and a library of books of interest. The eBook Collection contains more than 2,000 electronic textbooks.
11
 
On the ETS Proficiency Profile, University of Phoenix seniors slightly underperformed seniors in the comparison group in Critical Thinking, Reading, Writing, Mathematics, Social Sciences, and Natural Sciences. However, the differences between the two groups were slight and of limited significance. The performance of University of Phoenix seniors was equivalent to other seniors in the Humanities. The results are consistent with previous years and show a slight improvement over 2010.
The graduation rates for the University show an increase for the associate and master levels and a decline for the bachelor level. Most of the bachelor-level decline can be attributed to a corresponding increase in zero-transfer credit students in the bachelor programs. The University of Phoenix Associate Modified Graduation Rate is well above the IPEDS graduation rate for two-year institutions.

In the following tables:
 -  "UOPX" is University of Phoenix
 -  "AY2010" is the period from September 1, 2009, through August 31, 2010
 -  "AY2011" is the period from September 1, 2010, through August 31, 2011.
 -  Many employees of University of Phoenix are also students at University of Phoenix. Hence, data in the following tables will include some University of Phoenix employees.
 -  Most of the data in the following tables is the result of voluntary responses and thus may not reflect the total population.
 -  The "n" or sample size may vary by question in a survey because the respondents were not required to answer all the questions in a survey.
 -  "Master's universities and colleges" are institutions that offer both undergraduate and graduate degrees.

Information Literacy
The skills required to become successful in the digital workplace are woven throughout the five Learning Goals required for all University of Phoenix courses and programs: professional competence and values, critical thinking and problem solving, communication, information utilization, and collaboration.
The University has taken steps to ensure that the way students learn emulates the way professionals work. The University Library houses more than 105,000 electronic periodicals as well as e-books of interest. The eBook Collection is made up of 2,000 electronic books. Students and faculty have access to the entire eBook Collection throughout their degree programs. The University Library and eBook Collection are available to users seven days a week from anywhere there is an Internet connection. In addition to math and writing tutorials, the University also utilizes simulations, virtual laboratories and virtual organizations in courses. Virtual organizations are realistic web-based businesses, schools, health care and government organizations that promote authentic assessment by immersing students into problem-based learning environments. Nursing utilizes simulation laboratory mannequins.
Standardized Assessment of Information Literacy Skills
In an effort to benchmark student achievement in information literacy as compared to students from other institutions, the University uses the Standardized Assessment of Information Literacy Skills (SAILS), originally developed by Kent State University.15 The SAILS is based on the following Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL)19 Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education:
 -  Standard I: The information literate student determines the nature and extent of the information needed.
 -  Standard II: The information literate student accesses needed information effectively and efficiently.
 -  Standard III: The information literate student evaluates information and its sources critically and incorporates selected information into his or her knowledge base and value system.
 -  Standard V:* The information literate student understands many of the economic, legal, and social issues surrounding the use of information and accesses and uses information ethically and legally.
*ACRL Standard IV is not used in the SAILS assessment.
On the SAILS, University of Phoenix freshmen are equivalent in seven of the eight areas compared to freshmen at master's universities and colleges. In the eighth area, Evaluating Sources, University of Phoenix freshmen outperform other freshmen at master's universities and colleges.
University of Phoenix seniors are equivalent in all eight areas compared to seniors at master's universities and colleges. University of Phoenix seniors outperform University of Phoenix freshmen in five of the eight areas. Seniors and freshmen performed equivalently in the other three areas.

In the following tables:
 -  Outperformed = UOPX students had a significantly higher mean score on the skill set compared to their peers in the comparison group.
 -  Equivalent = the mean scores for UOPX students and their peers in the comparison group were statistically equivalent.
 -  Underperformed = UOPX students had a significantly lower mean score than their peers in the comparison group.
 -  Alpha (a) =.05 for all significance tests.
 -  Std. Error = Standard Error

Academic Proficiency and Progress
In the last twenty years, the accreditation community has placed significantly greater emphasis on the importance of assessing student learning.
ETSR Proficiency Profile
As a part of its assessment process, University of Phoenix uses the ETS Proficiency Profile developed by the Educational Testing Service (ETS).20 The tool measures college-level skills in critical thinking, reading, writing, mathematics, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences for undergraduate students. The assessment provides comparative data for more than 375,000 students nationwide at 380 institutions. For academic year 2011: Compared to freshmen at master's universities and colleges:
 -  University of Phoenix freshmen performed equivalently in Humanities and Social Sciences.
 -  University of Phoenix freshmen slightly underperformed in Critical Thinking, Reading, Writing, and Natural Sciences. However, the differences between the two groups were slight and of limited practical significance.
 -  University of Phoenix freshmen moderately underperformed in Mathematics.
Compared to seniors at master's universities and colleges:
 -  University of Phoenix seniors slightly underperformed in Critical Thinking, Reading, Writing, Mathematics, Social Sciences, and Natural Sciences. However, the differences between the two groups were slight and of limited practical significance.
 -  University of Phoenix seniors performed equivalently in Humanities.
University seniors slightly outperformed University freshmen in all skill sets.
27
 
In the following tables:
 -  Strongly Outperformed = UOPX had a significantly higher mean score than the comparison group with an absolute effect size of greater than
0.80.
 -  Moderately Outperformed = UOPX had a significantly higher mean score than the comparison group with an absolute effect size of 0.51_0.80.
 -  Slightly Outperformed = UOPX had a significantly higher mean score than the comparison group with an absolute effect size of 0.20_0.50.
 -  Equivalent = there was a non-significant difference between UOPX and the comparison group mean scores or a significant difference with an absolute effect size of less than 0.20.
 -  Slightly Underperformed = UOPX had a significantly lower mean score than the comparison group with an absolute effect size of 0.20_0.50.
 -  Moderately Underperformed = UOPX had a significantly lower mean score than the comparison group_ with an absolute effect size of 0.51_0.80
 -  Strongly Underperformed = UOPX had a significantly lower mean score than the comparison group with an absolute effect size of greater than 0.80.
 -  Std. Dev. = Standard Deviation.
 -  Alpha(a) = .05 for all significance tests.
 -  Scores range from 100 to 130.

Graduation Rates
The graduation rate is specified by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)21 to be calculated for ".students entering the institution as full-time, first-time, degree/ certificate-seeking undergraduate students in a particular year (cohort)." In this report, the "modified graduation rate" is for all enrolled students, including first-time attendees as well as those with prior college experience. This "modified" rate is defined as the percentage of students who completed at least three University of Phoenix credits and went on to be degree-complete. Data are for the number of students entering the University as degree-seeking students in a particular cohort year. Thus, the calculation in this report is a modification and includes more types of students than does the NCES graduation rate calculation.
The modified graduation rates for the University show an increase for the associate and master levels and a decline for the bachelor level. Most of the bachelor-level decline can be attributed to an increase in zero-transfer credit students. There is a high correlation between more transfer credits and higher graduation rates for non-traditional students. University of Phoenix associate modified graduation rate is well above the IPEDS graduation rates for two-year institutions.

*In the 2010 Academic Annual Report, the Associate 2005 cohort completion rate was reported as 23% for
3 Years and 24% for >3 Years. Historically, University of Phoenix had a limited number of Associate students.
A large number of Associate students transferred from Western International University (WIU) to the University of Phoenix in 2006. The Associate 2005 cohort reported in the 2010 Academic Annual Report included all students that potentially could transfer to University of Phoenix from WIU and those students that enrolled directly as Associate students into University of Phoenix. The Revised Associate 2005 cohort that is being reported is the Associate students that actually did transfer to University of Phoenix from WIU and those students that enrolled directly as Associate students into University of Phoenix.
**In the 2010 Academic Report, the Graduate 2005 cohort included both Master and Doctorate students. This year, "Graduate" is being broken into separate "Master" and "Doctorate" cohorts.

University Orientation is three weeks long and delivered in the same format as in existing classes. Students must complete assignments in a manner similar in nature to the way they will be working in class. Of those who start Orientation, approximately 80 percent enroll in University of Phoenix, while approximately 20 percent opt out before incurring any debt. Students who opt out are generally leaving with a positive experience. For students who went through Orientation and then enrolled in the University, first-course completion rates were higher than prior-year levels. Some of this retention success can be attributed to the First-Year Sequence, which was introduced in February 2010. The First-Year Sequence was designed using a laddering approach to the sequence of courses. Concepts and skills introduced in early classes are reinforced with work in later classes. Student Salary Increases While Enrolled Many University of Phoenix students are employed full time while enrolled. Internal research has shown that University of Phoenix students' average annual salaries for the time they are enrolled in their program of study increase at higher rates than the national average salary increase for the same time period. In addition to the figures the University has compiled, in June 2011 the Center for College Affordability and Productivity noted the following on their website, "the typical University of Phoenix alumni earns slightly more than those from the traditional competitive schools at every level of experience throughout their career."22 31

The information in Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K and Exhibit 99.1 furnished herewith shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that section, nor shall they be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Phoenix, February 28, 2012  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or the "Company") today provided details on new degreed enrollment and the fiscal 2012 outlook in anticipation of its participation at the Robert W. Baird Business Solutions Conference on Wednesday, February 29, 2012. In addition, the Company announced details for its fiscal 2012 second quarter conference call.
New Degreed Enrollment and Business Outlook Update
The Company currently anticipates new degreed enrollment for the second quarter ending February 29, 2012, will reflect approximately flat to low-single digit growth year-over-year on a percentage basis, as compared to previous expectations of growth similar to first quarter of fiscal 2012, which was approximately 13 percent. Adjusted to exclude the impact of an extra day in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, new degreed enrollment for the quarter is expected to decrease year-over-year in the low to mid -single digits, as compared to previous expectations of an increase in the mid-single digits. Management believes new degreed enrollment has been adversely impacted by a number of factors, including the improving labor market, the competitive environment, and changes in marketing channels to better identify potential students more likely to succeed at University of Phoenix.
The Company anticipates consolidated net revenue for fiscal year 2012 will be $4.1 to $4.3 billion, consistent with the previously provided outlook. The anticipated operating profit range for fiscal 2012 has been revised to $625 to $725 million, excluding the impact of special items, from the previous outlook of $655 to $750 million.
"While we expect new degreed enrollment to continue to fluctuate for the remainder of this year, we are encouraged by the favorable impact of improved retention and productivity gains during our second quarter," said Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer Chas Edelstein. "In addition, we continue to identify opportunities to be more efficient and improve profitability over time."
Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer and Apollo Global Chairman Greg Cappelli added, "As we begin to emerge from a period of transition, which continues to be impacted by the volatility in our industry, we believe our investments to differentiate the University of Phoenix will allow us to continue to provide our students with a high quality education, as well as position us for long-term growth."
Fiscal 2012 Second Quarter Conference Call Information
The Company will report its fiscal 2012 second quarter results after the market close on Monday, March 26, 2012, and will host a conference call at 2:00 p.m. MT (5:00 p.m. ET) the same day.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Phoenix, March 26, 2012  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or the "Company") today reported financial results for the three and six months ended February 29, 2012.
Second Quarter 2012 Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
"Empowering our students to achieve their desired academic and life outcomes is our highest priority," said Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer and Apollo Global Chairman Greg Cappelli. "We are building on our mission to provide world class education, as well as connecting education to careers, in order to further differentiate University of Phoenix. We are committed to leading education into the future."
Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer Chas Edelstein added, "We are working to continually improve our services to students to enhance their educational experience and outcomes. As we pursue opportunities for increased operating efficiency, our efforts to optimize allow us to invest in innovation and create new and better ways to reach adult learners, while keeping education affordable and accessible and delivering the best possible experience to our students."
Unaudited Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2012 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 totaled $969.6 million, which represents a 7.5% decrease compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2011. The decrease is the result of an 8.0% decrease in University of Phoenix net revenue, due principally to lower University of Phoenix enrollment, partially offset by selective tuition price and other fee changes. For the quarter, University of Phoenix Degreed Enrollment decreased 12.2% to 355,800, largely due to the decrease in New Degreed Enrollment during fiscal year 2011. The Company believes the decrease in 2011 New Degreed Enrollment was primarily the result of a number of important changes and initiatives implemented in recent years to more effectively support students and enhance their educational outcomes. Although University of Phoenix New Degreed Enrollment increased 1.0% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, we believe it has been impacted by changes in marketing content and channels to better identify potential students more likely to succeed at University of Phoenix, by changes in economic conditions and, in particular, an improving U.S. labor market, as well as by a continuing robust competitive environment.
The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended February 29, 2012, of $63.9 million, or $0.51 per share (126.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to a loss from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $66.6 million, or $0.47 per share (142.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended February 28, 2011.
Results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 included restructuring and other charges of $16.1 million associated with the Company's real estate rationalization plan.
Results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 included the following:
 
 
 
Excluding the special items noted above, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended February 29, 2012, was $73.8 million, or $0.58 per share (126.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $118.2 million, or $0.83 per share (142.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended February 28, 2011. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Operating Expenses
Instructional and student advisory increased $7.9 million, or 1.9%, to $429.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, which represents a 410 basis point increase as a percentage of net revenue. The expense increase was primarily related to the Company's initiatives, including technology, to more effectively support students and improve their educational outcomes.
Marketing increased $2.0 million, or 1.3%, to $159.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, which represents a 140 basis point increase as a percentage of net revenue. Marketing expense included costs attributable to establishing relationships with employers and community colleges.
Admissions advisory decreased $0.9 million, or 0.9%, to $101.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, which represents a 60 basis point increase as a percentage of net revenue. While admissions advisory headcount decreased, the cost savings was offset by higher average employee compensation costs.
General and administrative decreased $0.3 million, or 0.4%, to $84.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, which represents a 70 basis point increase as a percentage of net revenue.
Depreciation and amortization increased $2.8 million, or 7.3%, to $42.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, which represents a 60 basis point increase as a percentage of net revenue. The increase is principally attributable to $3.1 million of intangible asset amortization in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 as a result of the Carnegie Learning acquisition.
The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable ("bad debt expense") decreased $14.5 million, or 31.9%, to $31.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, which represents a 110 basis point decrease as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in gross accounts receivable associated with decreased University of Phoenix Degreed Enrollment; a decrease in the proportion of receivables that are attributable to students enrolled in associate's degree programs, as collection rates for these students are generally lower compared to students in more advanced level programs; and improved collection rates due, in part, to process initiatives implemented in fiscal year 2011.
Financial and Operating Metrics
Below are Apollo Group's unaudited financial data and operating metrics for the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 versus the prior-year period.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Unaudited First Six Months of Fiscal Year 2012 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the first six months of fiscal year 2012 totaled $2.1 billion, which represents a 9.6% decrease compared to the first six months of fiscal year 2011. The decrease in consolidated net revenue was primarily attributable to University of Phoenix's 10.1% decrease in net revenue principally due to lower University of Phoenix enrollment, partially offset by selective tuition price and other fee changes. In the first six months of fiscal year 2012, University of Phoenix's Average Degreed Enrollment decreased 15.6% as compared to the first six months of fiscal year 2011. The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the six months ended February 29, 2012, of $213.2 million, or $1.66 per share, (128.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), and $169.4 million, or $1.17 per share, (144.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the six months ended February 28, 2011.
Results for the first six months of fiscal year 2012 contained special items that include $21.7 million of restructuring and other charges associated with the Company's real estate rationalization plan and $16.8 million of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges for the UNIACC subsidiary of Apollo Global ($14.4 million net of the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests). The Company did not record a net tax benefit associated with the goodwill and other intangible asset impairment, as they are not deductible for tax purposes. Results for the first six months of fiscal year 2011 include goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $219.9 million for the BPP subsidiary of Apollo Global ($188.3 million net of the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests); a $3.8 million restructuring charge associated with a strategic reduction in force; and $2.5 million of charges for accrued incremental post-judgment interest and other estimated costs related to the securities class action lawsuit. The Company recorded a tax benefit of $5.0 million, net of noncontrolling interests, associated with these charges. The Company did not record a net tax benefit associated with the goodwill impairment, as it is not deductible for tax purposes.
Policeman's Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago
Excluding these special items, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the six months ended February 29, 2012, was $241.0 million, or $1.87 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $357.1 million, or $2.47 per share, for the six months ended February 28, 2011. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of February 29, 2012, the Company's cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $800.7 million, compared to $1,571.7 million as of August 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to payments on borrowings, share repurchases, funding a common fund account associated with our preliminary settlement in a legal matter, the purchase of Carnegie Learning and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash generated from operations.
As of February 29, 2012, accounts receivable decreased to $207.1 million from $215.6 million at August 31, 2011. Excluding accounts receivable and the related net revenue for Apollo Global, the Company's days sales outstanding was 22 days as of February 29, 2012, which remained consistent compared to 23 days as of August 31, 2011, and 22 days as of February 28, 2011.
Total debt outstanding (including short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt) decreased by $471.5 million to $127.5 million as of February 29, 2012, from $599.0 million as of August 31, 2011. The decrease is due to the repayment of the borrowings on the Company's $500 million credit facility.
Share Repurchases
The Company repurchased approximately 6.4 million and 8.1 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $51.65 and $50.42 per share for a total cost of $328.8 million and $407.0 million during the three and six months ended February 29, 2012, respectively. Additionally, subsequent to February 29, 2012, the Company repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares at a total cost of $92.5 million, resulting in $0.5 million remaining of the current share repurchase authorization.
SEC Update
On March 21, 2012, the Company was notified by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that the informal inquiry initiated in October 2009 was completed and that the staff does not intend to recommend any enforcement action by the Commission.
Business Outlook
The Company offers the following commentary regarding the outlook for fiscal year 2012 based on the business trends observed during the second quarter of fiscal year 2012, as well as management's current expectations of future trends.

performance and are utilized in financial and operational decision-making processes, such as budgeting and forecasting. Exclusion of items in the non-GAAP presentation should not be construed as an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Other companies, including other companies in the education industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure across companies.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On April 18, 2012, Apollo Group, Inc. entered into a five-year $625.0 million multi-currency revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent and various agents and lenders named therein. We may, subject to customary conditions, increase the aggregate revolving commitments by up to an additional $375.0 million, subject to, among other things, the receipt of revolving commitments for the increased amounts. The Credit Agreement replaces our existing $500.0 million senior revolving credit facility.
The Credit Agreement may be used for dollar-denominated revolving loans and for revolving loans denominated in certain foreign currencies, swingline loans and letters of credit, in each case up to sublimits specified therein. The facility is unsecured and guaranteed by our material domestic subsidiaries.
Revolving loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at a reserve and cost-adjusted LIBOR plus a margin ranging between 1.25% and 1.85% depending upon our then current leverage ratio. (At our option, revolving loans may instead bear interest using an alternative base rate plus a margin ranging between 0.25% and 0.85% depending upon our then current leverage ratio.)
We are also required to pay a facility fee on the average daily amount of the aggregate commitment available under the Credit Agreement (whether used or unused) ranging between 0.25% to 0.40% per annum depending upon our then current leverage ratio, a letter of credit participation fee on the average daily undrawn dollar amount of each letter of credit plus the amount of unreimbursed draws under such letter of credit at a per annum rate equal to the then current margin applicable to revolving loans bearing interest using LIBOR, and a letter of credit fronting fee equal to 0.125% of the average daily undrawn dollar amount of each letter of credit plus the amount of unreimbursed draws under such letter of credit, as well as customary administrative and other charges.
The credit facility contains various customary representations, covenants and other provisions. In addition, we are required to maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA (as each such term is defined in the Credit Agreement) of not greater than 2.50 to 1.00 and a minimum coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDAR to consolidated interest expense plus rent expense (as each such term is defined in the Credit Agreement) of not less than 1.75 to 1.00. Further, we are required to maintain a minimum DOE score of 1.5. The DOE ratio is a consolidated composite score determined by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education pursuant to regulations under Title IV.
Certain of the lenders under the Credit Agreement or their affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, certain commercial, banking, financial advisory, and investment banking services in the ordinary course of business for us and our subsidiaries, for which they receive customary fees and commissions.
The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement.
Item 8.01 Other Events.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Phoenix, June 25, 2012  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or the "Company") today reported financial results for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2012.
Third Quarter 2012 Highlights
 
 
 
 
"We are focused on delivering the best possible experience and service to support working adults, to address workforce needs, and to strengthen the connection to careers for our students," said Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer Chas Edelstein. "Evaluating key touch points, we are creating programs and support services that allow our students to focus on learning, experiencing achievements along the way to help inspire them and enhance their long-term outcomes."
Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer and Apollo Global Chairman Greg Cappelli added, "We are committed to being part of the solution to empower our country by providing access to affordable education and helping students develop the skills they need to succeed. We are investing in innovation to create new and better ways, enhanced by technology, to support adult learners and to connect our students' academic path to their career aspirations."
Unaudited Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2012 Results of Operations
Net revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 totaled $1,130.8 million, which represents an 8.5% decrease compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2011. The decrease was the result of a 9.1% decrease in University of Phoenix net revenue, due principally to lower University of Phoenix enrollment, partially offset by selective tuition price and other fee changes. For the quarter, University of Phoenix Degreed Enrollment decreased 13.1% to 346,300. New Degreed Enrollment decreased 8.0%, or 5.3% adjusting for available start dates, as compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2011.
The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended May 31, 2012, of $134.0 million, or $1.13 per share (118.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $211.9 million, or $1.51 per share (140.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended May 31, 2011.
Results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 included the following:
 
 
Results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 included the following:
 
 
Excluding the special items noted above, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended May 31, 2012, was $142.3 million, or $1.20 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $203.5 million, or $1.45 per share for the three months ended May 31, 2011. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Operating Expenses
Instructional and student advisory increased $12.0 million, or 2.6%, to $470.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, which represents a 450 basis point increase as a percentage of net revenue. The expense increase was primarily related to the Company's initiatives, including technology, to more effectively support students and improve their educational outcomes. This was partially offset by a decrease in costs that are more variable in nature such as faculty and certain advisory functions.
Marketing decreased $2.2 million, or 1.3%, to $158.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, which represents a 110 basis point increase as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in expense was principally attributable to lower advertising costs, offset by costs attributable to establishing relationships with employers and community colleges.
Admissions advisory decreased $4.6 million, or 4.6%, to $95.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, which represents a 30 basis point increase as a percentage of net revenue. While admissions advisory headcount decreased, the cost savings was partially offset by higher average employee compensation costs.
General and administrative increased $0.2 million, or 0.3%, to $88.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, which represents a 70 basis point increase as a percentage of net revenue.
Depreciation and amortization increased $4.0 million, or 9.8%, to $45.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, which represents a 70 basis point increase as a percentage of net revenue. The increase was principally attributable to $3.1 million of intangible asset amortization in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 as a result of acquiring Carnegie Learning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012.
Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable ("bad debt expense") decreased $3.8 million, or 9.7%, to $35.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, which represents a 10 basis point decrease as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in gross accounts receivable principally resulting from decreases in University of Phoenix Degreed Enrollment.
Financial and Operating Metrics
Below are Apollo Group's unaudited financial data and operating metrics for the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 versus the prior-year period.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Unaudited First Nine Months of Fiscal Year 2012 Results of Operations
Net revenue for the first nine months of fiscal year 2012 totaled $3.3 billion, which represents a 9.2% decrease compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2011. The decrease in net revenue was primarily attributable to University of Phoenix's 9.7% decrease in net revenue principally due to lower University of Phoenix enrollment, partially offset by selective tuition price and other fee changes. In the first nine months of fiscal year 2012, University of Phoenix's Average Degreed Enrollment decreased 15.0% as compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2011. The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the nine months ended May 31, 2012, of $347.2 million, or $2.77 per share, (125.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), and $381.3 million, or $2.66 per share, (143.2 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the nine months ended May 31, 2011.

Excluding the special items noted above, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the nine months ended May 31, 2012, was $383.3 million, or $3.06 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $560.6 million, or $3.91 per share for the nine months ended May 31, 2011. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of May 31, 2012, the Company's cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $602.1 million, compared to $1,571.7 million as of August 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to share repurchases, payments on borrowings, capital expenditures, and the purchase of Carnegie Learning, partially offset by cash generated from operations.
As of May 31, 2012, accounts receivable decreased to $191.7 million from $215.6 million at August 31, 2011. Excluding accounts receivable and the related net revenue for Apollo Global, the Company's days sales outstanding was 20 days as of May 31, 2012, as compared to 23 days as of August 31, 2011 and May 31, 2011.
Total debt outstanding (including short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt) decreased by $473.0 million to $126.0 million as of May 31, 2012, from $599.0 million as of August 31, 2011 due to the repayment of borrowings.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
This press release and the related conference call contain non-GAAP financial measures, which are intended to supplement, but not substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Management uses, and chooses to disclose to investors, these non-GAAP financial measures because (i) such measures provide an additional analytical tool to clarify the Company's results from operations and help to identify underlying trends in its results of operations, (ii) as to the non-GAAP earnings measures, such measures help compare the Company's performance on a consistent basis across time periods, and (iii) these non-GAAP measures are employed by the Company's management in its own evaluation of
performance and are utilized in financial and operational decision-making processes, such as budgeting and forecasting. Exclusion of items in the non-GAAP presentation should not be construed as an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Other companies, including other companies in the education industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure across companies.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
Apollo Group, Inc. announced today that it has been informed by the U.S. Department of Education that the Department intends to conduct an off-site program review focused on University of Phoenix's compliance with requirements to verify student supplied information and report to the Department appropriate verification status codes relating to the federal student financial aid (Title IV) programs in which the University participates. The review, which is scheduled to commence on July 16, 2012, initially will cover the federal financial aid award years 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 to date. The Department informed the University that an examination of the University's verification reporting for the 2010-2011 award year identified the University as having misreported verification status codes.
The information in Item 8.01 of this Form 8-K shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Sale of Mander Portman Woodward Limited.
On July 16, 2012, Apollo Group, Inc., its majority owned subsidiary, Apollo Global, Inc., and Apollo Global's wholly-owned subsidiary, BPP Holdings Limited entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with MPW Holdco Limited, an affiliate of Levine Leichtman Capital Partners, Inc., pursuant to which BPP Holdings sold all of the outstanding shares of its subsidiary, Mander Portman Woodward Limited, to MPW Holdco for 54.8 million ($85.3 million). Mander Portman Woodward is a United Kingdom-based secondary education institution. Mander Portman Woodward contributed approximately $0.03 per diluted share to the Company's fiscal year 2011 financial results. The sale reflects Apollo Group's strategy to focus on the post-secondary education market.
Mander Portman Woodward financial results are not material to Apollo Group's consolidated financial position or results of operations and therefore this sale is not expected to have a significant accretive or dilutive impact on its financial results. Apollo Group expects to recognize a gain on the sale of approximately $25 million, net of transaction costs, during its fourth quarter of 2012.
The Share Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, indemnities and restrictive covenants for a transaction of this type. The transaction was consummated upon the signing of the Agreement.

As previously disclosed in Apollo Group's Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2011, the Office of Inspector General (the "OIG") of the U.S. Department of Education (the "Department") is conducting an audit of the Department's program requirements, guidance, and monitoring of institutions of higher education offering distance education. As part of this audit of the Department, the OIG selected University to Phoenix to be visited and, we believe, several other schools as well.
In connection with the OIG's audit of the Department, the OIG examined a sample of University of Phoenix students who enrolled during the period from July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011. The OIG has notified University of Phoenix that in the course of this review it identified certain conditions that the OIG believes are Title IV compliance exceptions at University of Phoenix. Although University of Phoenix is not the direct subject of the OIG's audit of the Department, the OIG has asked University of Phoenix to respond so that the OIG may consider University of Phoenix's views in formulating the OIG's report to the Department. These exceptions relate principally to the calculation of the amount of Title IV funds returned after student withdrawals and the process for confirming student eligibility prior to disbursement of Title IV funds.
We are evaluating the OIG's description of the conditions. The conditions include apparent interpretations of certain Title IV regulations that have been subject to examination by the Department during prior Department program reviews of the University of Phoenix. These OIG interpretations of the regulations are inconsistent with some of the historical policies and practices of the University of Phoenix. We believe that the policies and practices of University of Phoenix during the relevant time period complied with the applicable regulations.
University of Phoenix remains committed to cooperating with the OIG, and it has responded to the OIG by requesting that it be afforded additional information and time to prepare its response. We cannot predict the outcome of the OIG's identification of the compliance conditions or whether any such outcome would materially impact University of Phoenix.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Dear Dr. Pepicello:
From July 16, 2012 through July 23, 2012, Nancy Taylor and Anna Archila conducted an off-site review of University of Phoenix's (UOP) administration of the programs authorized pursuant to Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, 20 U.S.C.  1070 et seq. (Title IV, HEA programs). The purpose of this Final Program Review Determination Letter is to close the program review.
The focus of the review was to determine UOP's compliance with the statutes and federal regulations as they pertain to the institution's administration of Title IV programs. The review consisted of, but was not limited to, an examination of UOP's verification policies and procedures, and the review of individual student financial aid files of students that had been selected for verification.
A sample of 30 files was identified for review from the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 award years. The files were selected randomly from a statistical sample of a population selected specifically for verification. Appendix A lists the names and partial social security numbers of the students whose files were examined during the program review.
Protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII):
PII is any information about an individual which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity (some examples are name, social security number, date and place of birth). The loss of PII can result in substantial harm, embarrassment, and inconvenience to individuals and may lead to identity theft or other fraudulent use of the information. Appendix A was encrypted and sent separately to the institution via e-mail.

Although the review was thorough, it cannot be assumed to be all-inclusive. The absence of statements in the report concerning UOP's specific practices and procedures must not be construed as acceptance, approval, or endorsement of those specific practices and procedures. Furthermore, it does not relieve UOP of its obligation to comply with all of the statutory or regulatory provisions governing the Title IV, HEA programs.
During the review, no findings were identified.
Record Retention:
Program records relating to the period covered by the program review must be retained until the end of the retention period otherwise applicable to the record under 34 C.F.R.  668.24(e).
We would like to express our appreciation for the courtesy and cooperation extended during the review. If you have any questions concerning this letter, please call Nancy Taylor at (415) 486-5508.
Sincerely,
 
Martina Fernandez-Rosario
Division Director

APOLLO GROUP, INC. REPORTS FISCAL 2012 FOURTH QUARTER AND
YEAR-END RESULTS
Phoenix, October 16, 2012  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) (Apollo Group, Apollo or the Company) today reported financial results for the three months and fiscal year ended August 31, 2012.
This past year, we have made great strides in executing on our strategy to differentiate University of Phoenix, diversify Apollo Group, and refine our business processes and delivery structure to be more efficient and effective, while providing a world class student experience, said Apollo Group Chief Executive Officer and Apollo Global Chairman Greg Cappelli. As we build the university of the future, our priority is to connect education to careers for our students, helping them achieve their desired academic and life outcomes.
Unaudited Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Results of Operations
Net revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 totaled $996.5 million, which represents an 11.0% decrease compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. The decrease was due principally to lower University of Phoenix enrollment, partially offset by selective tuition price and other fee changes. For the quarter, University of Phoenix Degreed Enrollment decreased 13.8% to 328,400 and New Degreed Enrollment decreased 13.7% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011.
The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended August 31, 2012, of $52.6 million, or $0.46 per share (113.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $189.7 million, or $1.38 per share (137.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), for the three months ended August 31, 2011.
Results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 include restructuring and other charges of $9.4 million ($6.0 million net of tax and the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests) associated with a series of restructuring activities to reengineer business processes and refine the Companys delivery structure. Results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 also contained special items, which are detailed in the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information tables of this press release.
Excluding the special items noted above, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended August 31, 2012, was $58.6 million, or $0.52 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $140.7 million, or $1.02 per share, for the three months ended August 31, 2011. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, the Company completed the disposition of BPP Holdings Limiteds (BPP) subsidiary Mander Portman Woodward (MPW), a UK secondary education institution, for 54.8 million (equivalent to $85.3 million as of the date of sale). The Company recognized a gain on sale of $26.7 million, net of transaction costs, and has reported MPWs operating results as discontinued operations in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented.
Operating Expenses
Instructional and student advisory increased $20.4 million, or 4.7%, to $455.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. The expense increase was primarily related to the Companys initiatives to more effectively support students and enhance their educational experience and outcomes, including investments in adaptive learning, curriculum development, the new learning and service platforms, and initiatives to connect education to careers. This was partially offset by a decrease in costs that are more variable in nature such as faculty and certain student advisory functions.
Marketing increased $9.7 million, or 5.7%, to $180.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. The increase was principally attributable to higher employee compensation and other costs, including expense related to building employer relationships, partially offset by lower advertising costs.
Admissions advisory decreased $13.6 million, or 13.7%, to $85.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. The decrease was principally attributable to lower admissions advisory headcount, partially offset by higher average employee compensation costs.
General and administrative decreased $6.2 million, or 6.2%, to $92.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011.
Depreciation and amortization increased $3.2 million, or 7.7%, to $44.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. The increase was principally attributable to higher intangible asset amortization as a result of acquiring Carnegie Learning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 and increased capital expenditures and capital leases in recent years primarily related to information technology.
Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable (bad debt expense) decreased $0.9 million, or 2.3%, to $38.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. The expense decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in gross accounts receivable principally resulting from decreases in University of Phoenix Degreed Enrollment.
Financial and Operating Metrics
Below are Apollo Groups unaudited financial data and operating metrics for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 versus the prior-year period.
Unaudited 2012 Fiscal Year Results of Operations
Net revenue for fiscal year 2012 totaled $4.3 billion, which represents a 9.7% decrease compared to fiscal year 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to University of Phoenixs 10.2% decrease in net revenue principally due to lower University of Phoenix enrollment, partially offset by selective tuition price and other fee changes. In fiscal year 2012, University of Phoenixs Average Degreed Enrollment decreased 14.8% as compared to fiscal year 2011.
The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for fiscal year 2012, of $393.7 million, or $3.22 per share (122.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to $566.3 million, or $4.00 per share (141.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), for fiscal year 2011. Results for fiscal years 2012 and 2011 contained special items, which are detailed in the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information tables of this press release. Excluding the special items, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for fiscal year 2012 was $435.7 million, or $3.56 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $696.5 million, or $4.91 per share for fiscal year 2011.
Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of August 31, 2012, the Companys cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $1.3 billion, compared to $1.6 billion as of August 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to share repurchases, capital expenditures, and the purchase of Carnegie Learning, partially offset by cash provided by operations, and proceeds from the disposition of Mander Portman Woodward.
As of August 31, 2012, accounts receivable decreased to $198.3 million from $215.6 million at August 31, 2011. Excluding accounts receivable and the related net revenue for Apollo Global, the Companys days sales outstanding was 22 days as of August 31, 2012, as compared to 23 days as of August 31, 2011.
Total debt outstanding (including short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt) increased by $120.9 million to $719.9 million as of August 31, 2012, from $599.0 million as of August 31, 2011. Subsequent to August 31, 2012, the Company repaid the $615.0 million drawn on its revolving credit facility.
Share Repurchases
The Company repurchased approximately 2.0 million and 19.1 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $31.60 and $41.82 per share for a total cost of $63.5 million and $799.5 million during the three and twelve months ended August 31, 2012, respectively.
Optimization Initiatives
The Company continues initiatives to reengineer business processes and refine its delivery structure, while maintaining a commitment to enhance the student educational experience and outcomes. These activities, including the actions discussed below, are expected to favorably impact annual operating expenses by at least $300 million by fiscal year 2014, when compared to fiscal year 2012. The Company expects to realize more than half of these cumulative cost savings in fiscal year 2013, with the remainder in fiscal year 2014.
As part of the reengineering initiative, University of Phoenix is realigning its ground locations throughout the U.S., which will directly impact approximately 4% of total Degreed Enrollment, or around 13,000 students. These students will be offered support to continue their education at the University of Phoenix either online, through alternative on-ground arrangements or, in limited cases, at existing University of Phoenix locations. This plan includes closing 115 locations, consisting of 90 learning and student resource centers, which are generally smaller satellite locations, and 25 campuses. University of Phoenix will
preserve a national coast-to-coast network of 112 locations and plans to retain a presence in 36 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Subject to regulatory approvals, the realignment is expected to be substantially complete in fiscal year 2013. The Company expects to incur approximately $175 million of restructuring and other charges, principally for lease exit and other related costs, with most of these costs incurred in fiscal year 2013. The Company plans to continue investing in its ground locations to create state-of-the art, technologically-integrated facilities offering academic and career support and increased mobile connectivity, while also continuing to advance its leading-edge online learning platform.
The Company has also begun implementing a workforce reduction and expects to decrease total headcount, excluding faculty, by approximately 800 employees during fiscal year 2013. The Company anticipates incurring approximately $25 million of restructuring and other charges in fiscal year 2013 related to workforce reductions.
Apollo Global, Inc.
On October 12, 2012, the Company entered into an agreement with The Carlyle Group and closed the purchase of Carlyles remaining 14.4% noncontrolling ownership interest in Apollo Global, Inc. for $42.5 million in cash, plus a contingent payment based on a portion of the Apollo Global operating results through the fiscal years ending August 31, 2017.

These forward-looking statements are based on current information and expectations and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual plans implemented and actual results achieved may differ materially from those set forth in or implied by such statements due to various factors, including without limitation (i) the impact of increased competition from traditional public universities and proprietary educational institutions, (ii) the impact of the Companys restructuring initiatives to increase operating efficiency and better align operations with student demand and business strategy, including the substantial reduction in University of Phoenix on-ground locations, (iii) the impact of changes in marketing channels and other recruiting practices to better identify students who are more likely to succeed at University of Phoenix, (iv) the impact of the Companys initiatives to improve the student experience, improve student outcomes and enhance the connection between education and careers, (v) changes in enrollment or student mix, (vi) changes in the overall U.S. or global economy, (vii) changes in law or regulation affecting the Companys eligibility to participate in or the manner in which it participates in U.S. federal and state student financial aid programs, and (viii) changes in the Companys business necessary to remain in compliance with existing, new, or amended U.S. federal student financial aid program regulations, including the so-called 90/10 Rule and the limitations on cohort default rates, and to remain in compliance with the accrediting criteria of the relevant accrediting bodies.

This press release and the related conference call contain non-GAAP financial measures, which are intended to supplement, but not substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Management uses, and chooses to disclose to investors, these non-GAAP financial measures because (i) such measures provide an additional analytical tool to clarify the Companys results from operations and help to identify underlying trends in its results of operations, (ii) as to the non-GAAP earnings measures, such measures help compare the Companys performance on a consistent basis across time periods, and (iii) these non-GAAP measures are employed by the Companys management in its own evaluation of performance and are utilized in financial and operational decision-making processes, such as budgeting and forecasting. Exclusion of items in the non-GAAP presentation should not be construed as an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e) Material Compensatory Plan, Contract or Arrangement.
On October 19, 2012, the Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors of Apollo Group, Inc. (the "Company") approved the terms of the 2013 fiscal year bonus plan under the Company's Executive Officer Incentive Performance Bonus Plan (the "2013 Plan"). The key features of the 2013 Plan may be summarized as follows:
Approval of 2013 Fiscal Year Executive Officer Bonus Plan.
All of the Company's executive officers will be eligible to participate in the 2013 Plan, including the following individuals, who are the named executive officers in the Company's shareholder Information Statement dated December 28, 2011 and filed on Schedule 14C with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 28, 2011:
Participants
.
 
For Mr. Cappelli, the target bonus amount was set at $750,000. For Dr. Sperling and Mr. D'Amico, the target bonus opportunity was set at 100% of their respective annual base salaries, and for Messrs. Swartz and Martin, the target bonus was set at 75%. For the target bonuses set at a percentage of base salary, the individual's base salary will be weighted to reflect any salary adjustments effected during the 2013 fiscal year. In no event, however, will the bonus amount paid to any participant exceed Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000).
The Compensation Committee established three separate performance goals under the 2013 Plan.
Performance Goals.
 
 
 
The potential cash incentive payable to each participant will be based on the actual attained level of each performance goal. Accordingly, the percentage of the target bonus amount assigned to each performance goal will be multiplied by the applicable factor (ranging from 0.5 at threshold to 2.0 at maximum level attainment). Should a performance goal be attained at a level between threshold and target or between target and maximum, then the applicable factor for the calculation of the potential cash bonus amount attributable to that performance goal shall be interpolated between those two levels on a straight linear basis.
Potential Cash Incentive Payment.
The cash bonus amount calculated for each participant on the basis of the attained levels of the five performance goals may be reduced by the Compensation Committee by up to thirty percent (30%) in the event the Compensation Committee determines that such a reduction is warranted based on its overall assessment of Company and individual performance.
Actual Cash Incentive Payment
.
The actual bonus attributable to the attainment of the 2013 fiscal year performance goals will be paid to each participant who continues in the Company's employ through the end of the 2013 fiscal year. In addition, pro-rated bonuses based on actual performance goal attainment will be paid to participants who do not complete the applicable service requirement by reason of death or disability.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Dr. Sperling has been conferred the honorary title of Chairman Emeritus of the Company, effective December 31, 2012.

On December 13, 2012, Peter Sperling, formerly Apollo's Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors (the "Board"), was elected Chairman of the Board, and Terri C.

Mr. Carter will participate in the cash and equity compensation programs provided to and upon the same terms as our other non-employee directors. These cash and equity compensation programs are more fully described under "Director Compensation" in our Information Statement on Form 14C filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 28, 2011, which description is incorporated in this Item 5.02 by this reference. In accordance with those programs, Mr. Carter received, at the time of his December 13, 2012 appointment to the Board, a pro-rated equity award for the balance of the 2013 fiscal year comprised of (i) an option grant covering 2,847 shares of the Company's Class A common stock with an exercise price of $21.40 per share and (ii) a restricted stock unit award covering an additional 6,231 shares of the Company's Class A common stock. Both components will vest upon his continuation in Board service through August 31, 2013. In addition, we have entered into an indemnification agreement with Mr. Carter on substantially the same terms as for our other non-employee directors that obligates us to indemnify him in his capacity as a director to the maximum extent permitted by law.

Exhibit Index

Apollo Group, Inc. Reports First Quarter 2013 Results
Phoenix, January 8, 2013  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) today reported financial results for the three months ended November 30, 2012, with revenue of $1.1 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.18 per share, or $1.22 per share
excluding special items.
In the first quarter, we continued to execute on our strategy to differentiate University of Phoenix, diversify Apollo Group and to further optimize our operations, said Apollo Group Chief Executive Officer Greg Cappelli. We are rolling out new career-oriented tools for students, as well as working with leading companies to help them meet their needs to develop an educated workforce. We are committed to become the educator of choice to connect education to careers and believe this approach will position us for long-term success.
First Quarter 2013 Results of Operations
Results for the first quarter 2013 include restructuring and other charges of $24.1 million attributable to the Companys optimization efforts and a $16.9 million credit for the reversal of charges associated with a securities class action lawsuit.
Excluding the special items noted above, income from continuing operations for the first quarter 2013 was $137.9 million, or $1.22 per share, compared to income from continuing operations of $165.3 million, or $1.26 per share, for the first quarter 2012. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release for first quarter 2013 and 2012 special items).
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for the first quarter 2013 totaled $824.2 million, a decrease of 9.4%, as compared to first quarter 2012. Excluding special items, operating expenses were $817.0 million, a decrease of 8.0%. This decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in costs from restructuring activities, which contributed to the decline in admissions advisory headcount, rent expense and depreciation expense. Additionally, a portion of the decrease was related to variable expenses due to lower net revenue. The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable (bad debt) also declined 19.7% to $33.4 million,
primarily due to lower enrollment, as well as improved collection rates for aged receivables, at University of Phoenix.
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow
As of November 30, 2012, cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $776 million compared to $1.3 billion as of August 31, 2012. The decrease was primarily due to $625.8 million used for payments on borrowings, including the payment of $615.0 million borrowed under the Companys revolving credit facility, the Companys $42.5 million cash payment for its purchase of the noncontrolling interest in Apollo Global and $27.5 million for capital expenditures. These items were partially offset by $210.1 million of cash provided by operations.
Accounts receivable were $201.5 million as of November 30, 2012, compared to $198.3 million at August 31, 2012. Excluding accounts receivable and the related net revenue for Apollo Global, the Companys days sales outstanding was 20 days as of November 30, 2012, as compared to 24 days as of November 30, 2011.
Business Outlook
The Company offers the following outlook for fiscal year 2013 based on the business trends observed during the first quarter 2013, as well as managements current expectations of future trends.

Pursuant to the terms of his pre-existing December 31, 2008 amended and restated deferred compensation agreement that was originally executed in December 1993, Dr. Sperling is also entitled to a lifetime annuity in the monthly dollar amount of $70,833.33, commencing as of January 1, 2013. However, by reason of the required six-month hold-back under applicable tax laws, a portion of the monthly annuity otherwise payable for the first six months will not be paid until July 1, 2013.
Dr. Sperling became Chairman Emeritus effective upon his retirement on December 31, 2012. In that capacity, he has the right to attend all Board meetings but does not receive any compensation for such attendance. However, he will be reimbursed for certain pre-approved business travel expenses incurred to attend Board meetings held outside the State of Arizona and other pre-approved business travel.

1. Higher Learning Commission Accreditation Reaffirmation Update
University of Phoenix Accreditation Reaffirmation Draft Report
On February 22, 2013, University of Phoenix, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, received from The Higher Learning Commission, a commission member of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (HLC) the HLC peer review teams draft report regarding the ongoing accreditation reaffirmation review of the University. HLC, a regional accreditor, is the Universitys institutional accreditor. In the draft report, the peer review team determined that the University is not in compliance with Criterion One of the Criteria for Accreditation, Core Component 1d, and certain of the related Minimum Expectations, all of which relate to the Universitys administrative structure and governance. Based on these alleged administrative and governance deficiencies, the team recommended that HLC place the University on Probation status. Specifically, the review team concluded that the University of Phoenix has insufficient autonomy relative to its parent corporation and sole shareholder, Apollo Group, Inc., to assure that its board of directors can manage the institution, assure the Universitys integrity, exercise the boards fiduciary responsibilities, and make decisions necessary to achieve the institutions mission and successful operation.
Although certain concerns were expressed by the team in the draft review report, as described below, the team found that University of Phoenix was in compliance with substantially all other Criteria of Accreditation, including the criteria associated with academic matters and student services, and, with one recommendation of a follow up report, all the applicable Federal Compliance Program Components. The team specifically noted that the University is well resourced and innovative and has many strengths, including a high level of relevant student services and technology and systems that benefit students and provide a consistent approach to facilitate learning across its programs and facilities.
As we discussed in our first quarter earnings call on January 8, 2013, HLC on that date informed University of Phoenix that the draft review report would include a recommendation that the University be placed on Notice status, a lesser form of sanction, due to various areas of concern. At the receipt of the teams draft report on February 22, the University was informed for the first time that the teams recommendation had been changed from Notice to Probation status. The HLC has not explained why the recommendation changed from Notice to Probation.
University of Phoenix, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apollo Group, Inc. and the University generates over 90% of the consolidated net revenue of Apollo Group. As the sole shareholder of University of Phoenix, Apollo Group elects each member of the University of Phoenix board of directors and is deeply interested in the operations and financial well-being of its most significant subsidiary. The management structure of Apollo Group and University of Phoenix is customary for parent/subsidiary corporate families in America and was designed to allow the officers and directors of Apollo Group to appropriately discharge their fiduciary duties to Apollo Group and its shareholders. We believe that it is neither remarkable nor improper for a parent corporation to exercise appropriate influence over its wholly-owned subsidiary. We note in this regard that the level of independence exercised by University of Phoenix relative to its parent, Apollo Group, has only increased since the prior reviews by HLC in 2000 and 2002 that specifically addressed and approved our governance structure.
Accordingly, University of Phoenix intends to challenge and appeal the teams Probation recommendation while also working closely with HLC to achieve agreement on an appropriate governance model that protects the core policy concerns of HLC, while permitting the executive officers and directors of Apollo Group and University of Phoenix to fully discharge their fiduciary duties to Apollo Group, University of Phoenix and their respective shareholders.
In addition to the Probation recommendation based on the perceived insufficient autonomy of University of Phoenix, the draft report also identifies various other areas of concern that require future reporting and follow-up activities by the University, but which were not the basis for the teams Probation recommendation. These areas include:
If the Probation recommendation is approved, the draft report recommends a probationary period through the Fall of 2014, with the requirement that University of Phoenix submit a probation report at that time demonstrating that the specified matters have been ameliorated. In addition, the draft report also recommends that University of Phoenix be required to submit within three months of any final decision by the HLC Board of Trustees with regard to the initial recommendation of Probation a plan delineating the manner in which it will achieve compliance with the specified conditions.
Western International University Accreditation Reaffirmation Draft Report
Also on February 22, 2013, Western International University (WIU), our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, received from HLC its draft report regarding the ongoing accreditation reaffirmation review of WIU. In the draft report, the review team made a finding that WIU is not in compliance with three of the Criteria for Accreditation, including governance, and therefore recommended that HLC place WIU on Probation status. As in the case of University of Phoenix, the draft report concluded that WIU does not have sufficient autonomy relative to its parent corporation and controlling shareholder. In addition, the draft review report makes a finding that WIU is not in compliance with requirements relating to WIUs institutional financial stability and student learning assessment.
HLC Probation
Probation is a publicly disclosed sanction for noncompliance by HLC. Probation status means that HLC has found conditions that make the institution no longer in compliance with one or more of its Criteria for Accreditation. An institution that is placed on Probation remains in that status for up to two years, although the HLC Board of Trustees may set a shorter time and may include conditions for interim reports on select topics. Prior to the end of the period of Probation, the institution must participate in another comprehensive evaluation visit. The purpose of the evaluation is two-fold:
first
, to assess whether the specific conditions that led to the Probation status has been ameliorated; and
second
, to establish that the institution remains in compliance with all other requirements of the Criteria for Accreditation. During this visit, and with regard to the conditions that led to Probation, the institution must present clear evidence of its amelioration of such conditions.
 
If the HLC Board of Trustees were to adopt the sanction of Probation, the Board would also reaffirm the accreditation of the affected institution for the period of Probation. However, during the probationary period the affected institution would be required to disclose its Probation status in connection with any statements regarding its HLC accreditation.
* * *
Leadership of University of Phoenix and Western International University are reviewing the draft reports, and intend to work closely with HLC staff and the peer review team to address all necessary issues. Each of the universities has the opportunity to challenge findings of fact in the draft review report and, following that, to appeal the final review report findings and recommendations to the HLC Institutional Actions Council First Committee (IACFC) and subsequently to formally respond to the HLC Board of Trustees regarding any recommendation of the IACFC. University of Phoenix and WIU intend to challenge and appeal the teams Probation recommendations. HLC has indicated that it believes this appeals process will be complete by the end of June 2013, although it is possible that the process could extend beyond that date. There will be no change in the accreditation status of either University of Phoenix or Western International University until the review and appeals are complete.
If, after completing the review and appeal of the team and IACFC recommendations, HLC elects to impose the sanction of Probation, the reputation of University of Phoenix and/or WIU, as the case may be, could be adversely affected, which in turn may negatively impact their ability to recruit and enroll students and to recruit and retain faculty and staff. To the extent that the sanctions have this effect, our business could be materially and adversely affected. We intend to work vigorously and closely with HLC to address their concerns in due course, and the HLC peer review team for the University of Phoenix has indicated in its draft report that it is confident that its concerns can be successfully addressed by the University. However, if University of Phoenix should lose its institutional accreditation, our business would be substantially impaired and we would not be able to continue our business as it is presently conducted. See the discussion of this and related risks under Risk Factors in our 2012 Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 22, 2012.
2. Termination of SEC Investigation
In our most recent quarterly filing on Form 10-Q, we noted that we were continuing to cooperate with the investigation initiated in April 2012 by the Enforcement Division of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to certain stock sales by company insiders and our February 28, 2012 announcement regarding revised enrollment forecasts. Since that time, on January 17, 2013, we were informed in writing that the Enforcement Division has completed its investigation into this matter and does not intend to recommend any enforcement action by the Commission.

Exhibit Index

Apollo Group, Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2013 Results
Phoenix, March 25, 2013  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) today reported financial results for the three and six months ended February 28, 2013, with second quarter revenue of $834.4 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.12 per share, or $0.34 per share
excluding special items.
Higher education is rapidly evolving as workforce demands and technological innovations drive change in our global economy, said Apollo Group Chief Executive Officer Greg Cappelli. We are further positioning our organization and brand with our continued commitment to help students acquire real workplace skills, achieve their academic goals, and  through the power of education  realize their career aspirations.
Second Quarter 2013 Results of Operations
Results for the second quarter 2013 included restructuring and other charges of $44.1 million attributable to optimization efforts and $6.4 million of credits associated with the favorable resolution of certain legal matters. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release for second quarter 2013 and 2012 special items).
Excluding the special items noted above, income from continuing operations for the second quarter 2013 was $38.0 million, or $0.34 per share, compared to $72.2 million, or $0.57 per share, for the second quarter 2012. The decrease in income from continuing operations was attributable to lower enrollment and an increase in marketing costs primarily due to higher advertising expense, which was partially offset by a reduction in certain costs associated with the Companys restructuring activities and lower bad debt expense.
First Six Months of 2013 Results of Operations
Net revenue for the first six months of fiscal year 2013 totaled $1.9 billion, which represents an 11.5% decrease compared to the first six months of fiscal year 2012 principally due to lower enrollment. In the first six months of 2013, University of Phoenix Average Degreed Enrollment decreased 14.5% to 316,300 as compared to the same period a year ago. The Company reported income from continuing operations
attributable to Apollo Group for the six months ended February 28, 2013, of $147.0 million, or $1.30 per share, compared to $209.7 million, or $1.63 per share, for the six months ended February 29, 2012.
Results for the first six months of 2013 included restructuring and other charges of $68.2 million attributable to the Companys optimization efforts and $23.2 million of credits associated with the favorable resolution of certain legal matters. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release for the first six months of 2013 and 2012 special items.)
Excluding the special items noted above, income from continuing operations for the six months ended February 28, 2013, was $175.8 million, or $1.56 per share, compared to $237.5 million, or $1.84 per share, for the six months ended February 29, 2012.
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow
As of February 28, 2013, cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $821.2 million compared to $1.3 billion as of August 31, 2012. The decrease was primarily due to $629.5 million used for payments on borrowings, $49.0 million for capital expenditures, $42.5 million cash payment for the purchase of the noncontrolling interest in Apollo Global, and $39.4 million used for the purchase of short-term investments. These items were partially offset by $299.0 million of cash provided by operations.
Accounts receivable were $177.6 million as of February 28, 2013, compared to $198.3 million at August 31, 2012. Excluding accounts receivable and the related net revenue for Apollo Global, the Companys days sales outstanding was 19 days as of February 28, 2013, as compared to 22 days as of February 29, 2012.
Share Repurchase Authorization
On March 22, 2013, the Apollo Group Board of Directors approved a share repurchase authorization up to an aggregate amount of $250 million. There is no expiration date on the repurchase authorization and repurchases, if any, will be made at the discretion of management.
Business Outlook
The Company offers the following outlook for fiscal year 2013 based on the business trends observed during the second quarter 2013, as well as managements current expectations of future trends.
The Company continues initiatives to reengineer business processes and refine its educational delivery structure. These restructuring activities are expected to favorably impact annual operating expenses by at least $350 million by fiscal year 2014, when compared to fiscal year 2012. This is a $50 million increase in anticipated savings from the Companys previous outlook.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
This press release and the related conference call contain non-GAAP financial measures, which are intended to supplement, but not substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Management uses, and chooses to disclose to investors, these non-GAAP financial measures because (i) such measures provide an additional analytical tool to clarify the Companys results from operations and help to identify underlying trends in its results of operations; (ii) as to the non-GAAP earnings measures, such measures help compare the Companys performance on a consistent basis across time periods; and (iii) these non-GAAP measures are employed by the Companys management in its own evaluation of performance and are utilized in financial and operational decision-making processes, such as budgeting and forecasting. Exclusion of items in the non-GAAP presentation should not be construed as an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Other companies, including other companies in the education industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure across companies.

1. Higher Learning Commission Accreditation Reaffirmation Update regarding University of Phoenix
As previously disclosed, on February 22, 2013, University of Phoenix, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, received from The Higher Learning Commission, a commission member of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools ("HLC"), the HLC peer review team's draft report regarding the ongoing accreditation reaffirmation review of the University. HLC, a regional accreditor, is the University's institutional accreditor. In the draft report, the peer review team determined that the University is not in compliance with one of the Criteria for Accreditation and certain of the related Minimum Expectations, all of which relate to the University's administrative structure and governance. Based on these alleged administrative and governance deficiencies, the team recommended that HLC place the University on Probation status.
University of Phoenix subsequently submitted its response regarding factual errors in the draft report, following which the peer review team issued its final report, which was unchanged in all material respects from the draft report, including the Probation recommendation.
On May 6, 2013, the HLC Institutional Actions Council First Committee ("IACFC") convened a hearing in accordance with applicable HLC procedures to review the peer review team's report and recommendations. In advance of that hearing, HLC invited University of Phoenix to submit to the IACFC new and updated information addressing any deficiencies cited in the team report, which the University did. In particular, the University submitted evidence regarding various governance changes made by the University and Apollo Group to enhance the autonomy of the University in response to the concerns expressed in the peer review team's report.
The IACFC's role is to make a separate and parallel recommendation for action to the HLC Board of Trustees, which will be considered by the board together with the peer review team's recommendation. The HLC Board of Trustees makes the final determination, which may be to accept some, all or none of the recommendations of the peer review team and the IACFC.
On May 9, 2013, the University of Phoenix received the written hearing report from the IACFC, which recommends that HLC reaffirm the University's accreditation for a ten-year period and that the University be placed on Notice status for two years due to concerns cited in the peer review team's report relating to governance, student assessment and faculty scholarship/research for doctoral programs.
Notice status is a sanction that means that HLC has determined that an institution is on a course of action that, if continued, could lead the institution to be out of compliance with one or more of the HLC Criteria for Accreditation or Core Components. If this sanction is approved by the HLC Board of Trustees as recommended by the IACFC, University of Phoenix would remain accredited and would be required to submit various reports and engage in specified follow up activities during the Notice period, which would be expected to last until June 2015. During the period of this sanction, the University would be required to disclose its Notice status in connection with any statements regarding its HLC accreditation.
The HLC Board of Trustees is expected to take final action on the University of Phoenix accreditation reaffirmation at its next scheduled meeting on June 27, 2013, and to advise the University as to its decision in a Final Action Letter to be provided in the following weeks. We cannot predict what action will be taken by HLC, which could include imposition of the sanction of Notice, the sanction of Probation, no sanction, or some other special status.
We believe that imposition of the sanction of Probation would adversely impact the reputation of the University of Phoenix and its ability to attract and retain students, faculty and employees, and could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We believe that imposition of the sanction of Notice could have similar, although less prominent, consequences for the University and our business. See the discussion of these risks under Risk Factors in our Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 25, 2013 and available on our website at www.apollogrp.edu.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
