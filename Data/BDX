ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS In the product liability action entitled Grant v. Becton Dickinson & Co., et al. (Case No. 98CVB07-05616, in the Court of Common Pleas, Franklin County, Ohio), the Court filed a decision on July 17, 2002 under Ohio procedural law granting plaintiff's motion for class certification "subject to any necessary alteration, modification, or amendment pursuant to Ohio Civ. R. 23." Under the Court's decision, the certified class relates to persons located in the State of Ohio who sustained accidental needlesticks with certain products but did not contract any disease. The Company vigorously denies that the claims in the case have any merit and will continue to oppose class action certification by promptly filing an appeal of the Court's decision with the Ohio Court of Appeals for the 10th Appellate Judicial District. Class certification of similar claims has been denied in two other states (Texas and Illinois). Three other states (California, New Jersey and Pennsylvania) have dismissed similar claims for having no merit.

INDEX TO EXHIBITS -----------------

Contact: - -------- Dean J. Paranicas/Investor Relations - 201-847-7102 Charles A. Borgognoni/Corporate Communications - 201-847-6651 BD ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR FISCAL THIRD QUARTER Franklin Lakes, NJ (July 24, 2002) - BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported quarterly revenues of $998 million for the fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2002, an increase of 6 percent from the same period a year ago. "We are pleased with our performance, paced by solid increases in sales of our safety-engineered products, prefillable drug delivery devices, and BD Biosciences immunology/cell biology reagents and Discovery Labware products," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We remain on track to achieve our full-year performance objectives." Diluted earnings per share were 44 cents for the third quarter. Included in third quarter earnings per share was a special charge of 4 cents recorded primarily in connection with the previously announced manufacturing restructuring in the BD Medical Systems segment. In addition, operating earnings included one cent of other manufacturing costs related to the restructuring that are reflected in cost of products sold. Excluding the special charge of 4 cents, diluted earnings per share would be 48 cents. Q3 Segment Results - ------------------ In the BD Medical Systems segment, worldwide revenues of $544 million increased 7 percent. Included in BD Medical Systems revenues were U.S. safety-engineered product sales of $88 million, versus $66 million in the prior year's quarter. Also contributing to the growth of the segment were sales of prefillable drug delivery devices, which grew 20 percent. The overall growth rate in the segment was offset in part by reduced sales of conventional devices in the U.S. due to the transition to safety-engineered devices and by lower Consumer Health Care sales.
Within Consumer Health Care, recording of sales of diabetes syringes in the U.S. is deferred until these products are sold by the Company's distribution channel partners to their end customers. In determining the amount of sales to be recorded each quarter, the Company relies upon independent sales and inventory data from its distribution channel partners. In the third quarter, one distribution channel partner reported that it held a higher level of inventory than it had previously reported to the Company. Accordingly, reported sales of diabetes syringes were negatively impacted by approximately $8 million. Sales by distribution channel partners to their end customers increased in line with the Company's expectations in the third quarter. In the BD Clinical Laboratory Solutions segment, worldwide revenues increased 5 percent to $298 million. Revenue growth of 11 percent in the Preanalytical Solutions portion of the segment was attributable primarily to U.S. safety-engineered device sales, which were $57 million, versus $43 million in the prior year's quarter. These results were partly offset by reduced sales of conventional devices due, in large part, to the transition to safety-engineered devices. In addition, worldwide sales of the Diagnostic Systems portion of the segment declined by 2 percent. As discussed in the second quarter press release, U.S. distributors had stocked inventory in advance of the installation by Diagnostic Systems of a new enterprise resource planning system. This inventory stocking adversely impacted revenue growth in the third quarter. In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues grew 3 percent to $156 million. Revenue growth was driven by strong sales of immunology/cell biology reagents (Pharmingen) and Discovery Labware products, which together represent slightly less than half of BD Biosciences' worldwide revenues. Molecular biology reagent (Clontech) revenues decreased versus the prior year's quarter due to continued weakness in some portions of the molecular biology market, largely due to an industry shift from early stage drug target identification to later stage drug development. In response to these developments, BD Biosciences has adjusted its related workforce and redirected its research and development efforts toward later stage drug development products. Softness in pharmaceutical research and development and related capital spending, coupled with the timing of certain instrument installations that are anticipated to occur in the fourth quarter, resulted in essentially flat revenues from flow cytometry instruments and reagents (Immunocytometry Systems) in the quarter. Q3 Geographic Results - --------------------- On a geographic basis, third quarter revenues in the U.S. increased 4 percent to $532 million. Revenues outside the U.S. of $466 million grew 7 percent. At constant foreign exchange rates, revenues outside the U.S. grew 9 percent. Nine-month Results - ------------------ For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2002, reported revenues were $2.956 billion, a 7 percent increase over a year ago, or 8 percent at constant foreign exchange rates. Diluted earnings per share for the nine-month period were $1.29, or $1.35 excluding the special charges primarily relating to the manufacturing restructuring, and reflect an approximate 7 1/2 cent benefit from the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." For the same period in fiscal 2001, diluted earnings per share were $1.14, before the cumulative effect of an accounting change.
Restructuring and Divestitures - ------------------------------ In connection with the manufacturing restructuring, the Company recorded a special charge of approximately $12 million, or 4 cents per share, in the third quarter. Included in this amount was the reversal of approximately $4 million of special charges recorded in fiscal 2000, primarily resulting from lower than anticipated employee severance. As expected, ongoing operating results in the third quarter reflect the impact of other manufacturing restructuring costs included in cost of products sold, which reduced earnings per share by approximately one cent. The Company recorded a special charge of approximately $10 million, or two cents per share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 associated with this restructuring program. On April 8, 2002 the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Aortech International plc ("Aortech") to sell its critical care product line. As previously indicated, several important actions must occur, including the execution of a definitive purchase agreement and the approval of Aortech's Board of Directors and shareholders, before the sale can be completed. Assuming these actions are completed, the Company would record a substantially non-cash loss on sale (pre-tax), currently estimated to be in the $35 to $40 million range. Fiscal 2002 Outlook - ------------------- The Company continues to expect diluted earnings per share to be approximately $1.88 for fiscal 2002 and approximately 53 cents for the fourth quarter, excluding the special charges and loss on the potential sale of the Critical Care product line. The following table analyzes the estimated reported earnings per share for fiscal 2002: (A) These amounts include the previously announced favorable impact from the elimination of goodwill amortization under SFAS No. 142 of approximately $0.10 per share for the full year, or $0.025 per quarter. (B) Recorded to cost of products sold. (C) Does not include estimated loss on potential sale of Critical Care product line. BD is a medical technology company that serves healthcare institutions, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, industry and the general public. BD manufactures and sells a broad range of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment and diagnostic products. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001, BD reported total revenues of $3.8 billion. ***

BECTON DICKINSON AND COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS Nine Months Ended June 30, 2002 Fiscal 2002 revenues included hedging costs of approximately $3.1 million for the third quarter and $7.0 million for the nine months, compared with $0.4 million and $8.6 million, respectively, in fiscal 2001. These costs related to BD's purchased option contracts to hedge a portion of its anticipated sales from the United States to non-U.S. customers. Hedging costs of approximately $8.1 million for the first six months of fiscal 2001 were recorded in Other Expense under previous accounting guidance. This amount has been reclassed to revenues. Also included in revenues were gains on purchased option and forward contracts recorded in revenues in fiscal 2002 of approximately $1.3 million for the third quarter and $4.4 million for the nine months compared with $4.0 million and $8.1 million, respectively, in fiscal 2001. BD adopted the provisions of Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements," (SAB 101) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001,retroactive to October 1, 2000. Prior year amounts have been restated to reflect this adoption. A complete discussion of this accounting change can be found in BD's 2001 annual report on Form 10-K. Effective October 1, 2001, BD adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," which, among other things, eliminates the requirement to amortize goodwill and certain other intangible assets. The Company currently estimates the full year impact to earnings per share to be approximately 10 cents or 2.5 cents per quarter. Page 3

Item 9. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE The following statement is being furnished by the Company under the provisions of Regulation FD: The Company announced today that for fiscal 2003 the Company is revising its earlier diluted earnings per share guidance to approximately $2.07. This revision to previous guidance of approximately $2.05 per share reflects the Company's decision to no longer pursue the divestiture of its Critical Care Monitoring product line which has annual revenues of approximately $47 million, and certain other product lines having aggregate annual revenues of approximately $150 million. Previous fiscal 2003 guidance of approximately $2.05 per share reflected approximately 5 cents of dilution from the then anticipated divestitures. Revised guidance assumes that approximately 3 cents per share will be reinvested in these product lines and in other initiatives. The net effect of these decisions is to increase previous guidance by approximately two cents per share. This report may contain certain forward-looking statements (as defined under Federal securities laws) regarding the Company's performance, including future revenues, products and income, or events or developments that the Company expects to occur or anticipates occurring in the future. All such statements are based upon current expectations of the Company and involve a number of business risks and uncertainties. Actual results could vary materially from anticipated results described, implied or projected in any forward-looking statement. Factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from any forward-looking statement include, but are not limited to: competitive factors; pricing and market share pressures; uncertainties of litigation; the Company's ability to achieve sales and earnings forecasts, which are based on sales volume and product mix assumptions, to achieve its cost savings objectives, and to achieve anticipated synergies and other cost savings in connection with acquisitions; changes in regional, national or foreign economic conditions; increases in energy costs; fluctuations in costs and availability of raw materials and in the Company's ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships; changes in interest or foreign currency exchange rates; delays in product introductions; and changes in health care or other governmental regulation, as well as other factors discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not intend to update any forward-looking statements.

Contact: Dean J. Paranicas/Investor Relations - 201-847-7102 Charles A. Borgognoni/Corporate Communications - 201-847-6651 BD ANNOUNCES RECORD FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR REVENUES Franklin Lakes, NJ (November 6, 2002) - BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported record quarterly revenues of $1.077 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter ended September 30, 2002, an increase of 9 percent from the same period a year ago. For the full year, the Company reported record revenues of $4.033 billion, an 8 percent increase over a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were 50 cents for the fourth quarter, which included a charge of $13 million before taxes (recorded in "Other Expense") reflecting the non-cash write-down of two equity investments resulting from a decline in market values. Excluding the charge, diluted earnings per share would have been 53 cents. Diluted earnings per share for the full year of $1.79 also included special charges recorded in the second and third quarters totaling 6 cents per share, relating to the previously-announced manufacturing restructuring in the BD Medical Systems segment.
Results for fiscal 2002 also reflected a 10 cent benefit from the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Fiscal 2001 diluted earnings per share were 49 cents for the fourth quarter and $1.49 for the full year, which included a charge in the amount of 14 cents per share for the cumulative effect of an accounting change recorded in connection with the Company's adoption of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements." "Our strategies aimed at accelerating top line growth and driving productivity are working. Revenue and earnings growth represent the achievement of the full year performance objectives we had communicated to our shareholders at the beginning of the year," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "These results reflect solid revenue performance from all three business segments, and in particular from our growth drivers. Safety-engineered product sales grew 38 percent to $573 million, prefillable drug delivery devices enjoyed a year of mid-teens growth, and BD Biosciences closed the year strongly. Our strong cash flow continues to be driven by our ongoing efforts to achieve greater operational effectiveness and even stronger balance sheet productivity."
Segment Results In the BD Medical Systems segment, worldwide revenues of $574 million increased 7 percent for the quarter. Included in these revenues were U.S. safety-engineered product sales of $103 million, versus $78 million in the prior year's quarter. Sales of safety-engineered products for the full year totaled $353 million, versus $253 million in the prior year. Also contributing to the growth of the segment were sales of prefillable drug delivery devices, which grew 9 percent in the quarter and 17 percent for the full year. The overall growth rate in the segment was partly offset by reduced sales of certain conventional devices in the U.S. due to the transition to safety-engineered devices. In the BD Clinical Laboratory Solutions segment, worldwide revenues increased 11 percent for the quarter to $326 million. Revenue growth of 10 percent in the Preanalytical Solutions portion of the segment was due to U.S. safety-engineered product sales, which were $64 million, versus $50 million in the prior year's quarter. Sales of safety-engineered products for the full year totaled $220 million, versus $163 million in the prior year. The overall growth rate of the Preanalytical Solutions portion of the segment was partly offset by reduced sales of certain conventional devices in the U.S. due to the transition to safety-engineered devices. Also contributing to the segment's performance were worldwide sales of the Diagnostic Systems portion of the segment, which increased by 11 percent, driven by strong worldwide performance of its molecular diagnostic platform, BD ProbeTec ET'TM'.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues grew 14 percent to $177 million for the quarter. Revenue growth was driven by strong sales of flow cytometry instruments and reagents (Immunocytometry Systems), immunology/cell biology reagents (Pharmingen), and Discovery Labware products. Molecular biology reagent (Clontech) revenues of $18 million decreased by approximately $2 million versus the prior year's quarter due to continued weakness in some portions of the molecular biology market, largely due to softness in pharmaceutical/biotech research and development spending, and a shift in pharmaceutical focus from early stage drug target identification to later stage drug development. BD Biosciences has refocused the Clontech research and development efforts toward producing a product portfolio aligned with changing customer focus, and has streamlined operations. Geographic Results On a geographic basis, fourth quarter revenues in the U.S. increased 8 percent to $590 million. Revenues outside the U.S. of $487 million grew 10 percent, or 7 percent at constant foreign exchange rates. For the full year, revenues in the U.S. increased 8 percent to $2.173 billion. Revenues of $1.860 billion outside the U.S. increased by 8 percent, or 9 percent at constant foreign exchange rates. Fiscal 2003 Outlook The Company confirmed its estimate of approximately $2.07 for diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2003. The Company also indicated that it estimates first quarter diluted earnings per share would approximate 39 cents. Included in first quarter estimated diluted earnings per share are
approximately 2 cents of incremental costs associated with the anticipated U.S. launch of the Company's blood glucose monitoring product.

As part of the new product launches, BD has entered into two separate and unrelated strategic relationships with industry leaders Medtronic MiniMed, the diabetes management business of Medtronic, Inc. (NYSE: MDT), and Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) (NYSE: LLY) to increase its diabetes care market presence. "We are very excited to unveil our new products that offer patients a less painful, more convenient solution to managing their blood glucose levels," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of BD. "We believe these products set a new performance standard in the blood glucose monitoring industry. In addition, the strategic relationships we are announcing today with Medtronic MiniMed and Lilly, each leaders in their respective diabetes care markets, will significantly expand the reach of BD's new blood glucose products. Through these relationships, we also intend to pursue next-generation diabetes products." The BD Logic'TM' Blood Glucose Monitor is a cutting edge meter with best-in-class strip technology, an easy-to-read display screen and large data capacity. The BD Latitude'TM' Diabetes Management System is the first fully integrated therapeutic diabetes device that contains a blood glucose monitor, lancing device, lancets, strips, and storage for an insulin pen and pen needles, all the tools needed to test and inject. Both the BD Logic'TM' Blood Glucose Monitor and the BD Latitude'TM' Diabetes Management System use the thinnest lancet available (33-gauge) to minimize pain and test strips that require only a minimal amount of blood (.3'u'L), and deliver accurate results in just 5 seconds. Under the terms of the worldwide agreement, Medtronic MiniMed will distribute a co-branded version of the BD Logic'TM' Blood Glucose Monitor and BD'TM' strips through its global distribution channels. In addition, the companies will collaborate in the development of integrated systems that provide greater convenience for Medtronic MiniMed pump wearers, who represent the most frequent blood glucose testers.
"This alliance enables us to better serve our customers today by offering a best-in-class monitor and strips, and will extend our leadership position in the future by developing integrated systems to simplify diabetes management," said Jeffery A. McCaulley, Vice President and General Manager, Diabetes, Medtronic MiniMed. "We believe product simplification will foster patient adherence, improving blood sugar control and overall health of diabetes patients." Under the terms of the agreement with Lilly, Lilly will utilize its U.S. diabetes sales organization to provide targeted support for the market introduction of the new BD Latitude'TM' Diabetes Management System, and will help create awareness of the new product with healthcare professionals. There is no sharing of revenue between the companies. Lilly and BD also will jointly pursue future opportunities in diabetes disease management. "Lilly is committed to improving the care and quality of life for people with diabetes and considers this relationship as an opportunity to advance these objectives," said Khoso Baluch, U.S. diabetes care business unit leader for Lilly. A conference call regarding the new BD diabetes products and two agreements will be held on January 8, 2003 at 8:00 a.m. (EST). Investors and the general public are invited to listen via live webcast at www.bd.com.

Contact: - -------- Dean J. Paranicas/Investor Relations - 201-847-7102 Patricia A. Spinella/Investor Relations - 201-847-5453 Charles A. Borgognoni/Corporate Communications - 201-847-6651 BD ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR FISCAL FIRST QUARTER Franklin Lakes, NJ (January 23, 2003) - BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported revenues of $1.052 billion for the fiscal first quarter ended December 31, 2002, an increase of 11 percent from the same period a year ago. At constant foreign exchange rates, revenues increased 9 percent. "We are pleased with the Company's strong revenue growth in the quarter, paced by our BD Medical Systems and BD Clinical Laboratory Solutions segments that reflect contributions from several key areas - safety-engineered products, prefillable drug delivery devices and our BD ProbeTec ET'TM' diagnostic instrument platform," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "As we had forecast, BD Biosciences' first quarter revenues were slightly ahead of the prior year's quarter. This reflected the impact of factors unfavorably affecting sales of molecular biology reagents and flow cytometry instruments that we expect will continue through the second quarter, but which we anticipate will improve in the second half of the year." "We are very excited about the launch of our new blood glucose monitoring products, the BD Logic'TM' Blood Glucose Monitor and the BD Latitude'TM' Diabetes Management System," Mr. Ludwig added. "These products are among the most significant launches in the Company's history, and we believe their best-in-class performance characteristics, coupled with our strategic relationships with Medtronic, Inc. and Eli Lilly and Company, position us for success in the blood glucose monitoring market." Diluted earnings per share and net income for the quarter were 43 cents and $114 million, respectively. For the same period in fiscal 2002, diluted earnings per share and net income were 37 cents and $100 million, respectively. Diluted earnings per share reflected, among other things, the benefit of approximately 2 cents related to favorable foreign exchange translation, particularly in Europe.
Segment Results - --------------- In the BD Medical Systems segment, worldwide revenues of $572 million increased 14 percent in the quarter, driven by U.S. safety-engineered product sales of $100 million, versus $78 million in the prior year's quarter, and strong sales of prefillable drug delivery devices, which grew 30 percent to $93 million. Consumer Healthcare products also posted strong growth in the quarter, based in part on a favorable comparison to 2002 in U.S. diabetes syringe sales. The overall growth rate in the segment was partly offset by reduced sales of certain conventional devices in the U.S. due to the transition to safety-engineered devices. In the BD Clinical Laboratory Solutions segment, worldwide revenues increased 13 percent for the quarter to $332 million. Revenue growth of 12 percent in the Preanalytical Solutions portion of the segment was due primarily to strong U.S. safety-engineered product sales, which were $65 million, versus $49 million in the prior year's quarter, and which were partly offset by reduced sales of certain conventional devices in the U.S. due to the transition to safety-engineered devices. Contributing to revenue growth of 13 percent in the Diagnostics Systems portion of the segment were strong sales of respiratory and flu diagnostic tests, especially in Japan, and worldwide sales of its molecular diagnostic platform, BD ProbeTec ET'TM'. The BD Biosciences segment's worldwide revenues were slightly ahead of last year at $148 million. These results reflected strong sales of flow cytometry reagents and immunology/cell biology (Pharmingen) reagents and Discovery Labware products. This growth was partly offset by sales of molecular biology (Clontech) reagents, which were below the prior year due to continued weakness in some portions of the molecular biology research market. In addition, as anticipated, flow cytometry instrument sales growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by a reduction in order backlog in fiscal 2002 resulting from order fulfillment and installation improvements. In addition, favorable reaction to the first quarter announcement of the new BD FACSAria'TM' cell sorter caused some order postponement in anticipation of the availability of this new instrument later in the year. Geographic Results - ------------------ On a geographic basis, first quarter revenues in the U.S. increased 12 percent to $557 million. Revenues outside the U.S. of $494 million grew 10 percent, or 5 percent at constant foreign exchange rates. International revenues in the first quarter benefited from strong performance in Japan, offset in part by the effects of continuing unfavorable economic conditions in Latin America. A conference call regarding BD's first quarter results and its expectations for the second quarter and full fiscal year will be broadcast live on BD's website at 8:30 a.m. EST Thursday, January 23, 2003. The conference call will be available for playback at 1-800-468-0320 (domestic) and 1-402-344-6805 (international) through the close of business on January 30, 2003.

To be in proper written form, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must set forth (a) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and Rule 14a-11 thereunder (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected), (b) as to each matter such shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (c) the name and record address of such shareholder, (d) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Company that are owned beneficially or of record by such shareholder, (e) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such shareholder and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with -2-
such nomination or proposal of such business by such shareholder and any material interest of such shareholder in such business and (f) a representation that such shareholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such business before the meeting. No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of shareholders except business brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.D; provided, however, that, once business has been properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with such procedures, nothing in Section 2.D. shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any shareholder of any such business. If the Chairman of an annual meeting determines that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the Chairman shall declare to the meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting and such business shall not be transacted. SECTION 3. QUORUM. The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of shares representing a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at a meeting shall constitute a quorum. The shareholders present in person or by proxy at a duly organized meeting may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum. If a quorum not be present or represented at any meeting, the Chairman of the meeting or a majority of the shareholders present in person, or by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting without notice until the required voting shares shall be represented. At such adjourned meeting with the requisite amount of voting shares represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. SECTION 4. NOTICE OF MEETINGS. A written notice of each annual or special meeting of the shareholders of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board or the President or the Secretary, which shall state the time, place and purpose of such meeting, shall be delivered personally or mailed, not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days before the date of any such meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, the notice shall be directed to the shareholder at his address as it appears on the records of the stock transfer agent. Any shareholder, in person or by proxy, may at any time by a duly signed statement in writing to that effect, waive any statutory or other notice of any meeting, whether such statement be signed before or after such meeting. SECTION 5. VOTING. At all meetings of the shareholders, each holder of common stock having the right to vote, and present at the meeting in person or by proxy, shall be entitled to one vote for each full share of common stock of the Company entitled to vote and registered in his name. Each holder of preferred stock of any series shall have such voting powers, if any, as the Board of Directors shall have fixed by resolution prior to the issuance of any shares of such series. Whenever any action is to be taken by vote of the shareholders, it shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of the shareholders by the holders of shares entitled to vote, unless a greater plurality is required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation. -3-
SECTION 6. PROXIES. Any shareholder of record entitled to vote may be represented at any annual or special meeting of the shareholders by a duly appointed proxy.

The order of business at all meetings of the shareholders shall be as determined by the Chairman of the meeting, but the order of business to be followed at any meeting at which a quorum is present may be changed by a vote of the shareholders. SECTION 9. RECORD DATE FOR ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT. In order that the Corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in New Jersey, its principal place of business or to any officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action. Nothing in this Article II, Section 9 shall require the Board of Directors to take any action with respect to any proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought other than to fix a record date as provided for herein; and the fixing of any such record date shall not be deemed to be an action taken by the Board of Directors with -4-
respect to any such proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought for any other purpose. SECTION 10. INSPECTORS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by Article II, Section 9, to the Company of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Company shall engage nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Company that the consents delivered to the Company in accordance with Article II, Section 9 represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any shareholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation). SECTION 11. EFFECTIVENESS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each shareholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with Article II, Section 9, a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to the Company in the manner prescribed in Article II, Section 9.

1 Becton Drive Franklin Lakes, NJ 07417 www.bd.com NEWS RELEASE [LOGO] Contact: Charles A. Borgognoni, Corporate Communications - 201-847-6651 Patricia A. Spinella, Investor Relations - 201-847-5453 BD Comments Further on West Pharmaceutical Services Plant Incident Franklin Lakes, NJ (February 5, 2003) - BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE:BDX) and West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (NYSE:WST) have completed a comprehensive review of potential impacts to BD resulting from the tragic events of January 29 at the West manufacturing facility in Kinston, NC. West is a supplier of rubber, plastic and metal components used in the manufacture of various BD products. "BD shares in the sorrow experienced by all employees of West Pharmaceutical Services from this tragedy," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "BD and West are working closely together to maintain stability in the supply of vital medical devices to our customers." Four BD units were served in some part by the Kinston facility. For Consumer Healthcare products (insulin syringes) and Pharmaceutical Systems products (prefillable injection devices), detailed action plans are already being implemented to shift services performed by the West Kinston facility to other West facilities. BD anticipates no interruptions in supply to Consumer Healthcare customers, and is working to maintain consistent supply to Pharmaceutical Systems customers. For Preanalytical Solutions and Medical Surgical, the products impacted include BD Vacutainer'TM' blood collection needles and winged collection sets, and BD'TM' syringes. The West Kinston facility supplied BD with rubber sleeves for blood collection needles and winged sets, and plunger stoppers for BD'TM' syringe sizes 5ml and larger. BD and West are now implementing actions to expand manufacturing of these components in other West facilities, while also preparing to move certain manufacturing equipment for these components from Kinston to other West facilities that currently run similar processes. BD and West are working with regulatory authorities to expedite the equipment relocations. Based on these facts, BD anticipates that supply interruptions to our customers, if any, will be short-term in nature. Due to the anticipated timing, scope and costs associated with the actions described above, BD estimates that up to 2 cents of diluted earnings per share could shift from this quarter to the second half of the year. BD does not expect these events to otherwise affect its financial results for fiscal 2003. * * *
BD is a medical technology company that serves healthcare institutions, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, industry and the general public. BD manufactures and sells a broad range of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment and diagnostic products. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, BD reported total revenues of $4.033 billion. This press release may contain certain forward-looking statements (as defined under Federal securities laws) regarding BD's performance, including future revenues, products and income, or events or developments that BD expects to occur or anticipates occurring in the future. All such statements are based upon current expectations of BD and involve a number of business risks and uncertainties. Actual results could vary materially from anticipated results described, implied or projected in any forward-looking statement. Factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from any forward-looking statement include, but are not limited to: competitive factors; pricing and market share pressures; uncertainties of litigation; BD's ability to achieve sales and earnings forecasts, which are based on sales volume and product mix assumptions, to achieve its cost savings objectives, and to achieve anticipated synergies and other cost savings in connection with acquisitions; changes in regional, national or foreign economic conditions; increases in energy costs; fluctuations in costs and availability of raw materials and in BD's ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships; changes in interest or foreign currency exchange rates; delays in product introductions; and changes in health care or other governmental regulation, as well as other factors discussed in this press release and in BD's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not intend to update any forward-looking statements.

Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits. (c) Exhibits. Exhibit 99.1 Press release dated April 25, 2003 announcing financial results for the second quarter ended March 31, 2003. Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure. The information contained in this Item 9 of this Current Report is being furnished pursuant to "Item 12. Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition", in accordance with SEC Release No. 33-8216. The information in this Current Report is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section. On April 25, 2003, the Company issued a press release announcing its preliminary financial results for the second quarter ended March 31, 2003. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. In the press release, the Company presented the following non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures: o The Company presented the Company's revenue growth rates at constant foreign exchange rates. Management believes that presenting growth rates at constant foreign exchange rates allows investors to view the business results of the Company and of its segments without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating comparisons to prior periods. o The Company presented the Company's earnings per share for the three and six-month periods ended March 31, 2002 after excluding the impact of a special charge relating to a manufacturing restructuring. Management believes that excluding this charge from earnings per share allows investors to more easily compare the Company's financial performance to the corresponding prior period and to understand the operating results of the Company without the effects of this charge. The Company's management considers these non-GAAP financial measures internally in evaluating the Company's performance. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in the press release. 1

INDEX TO EXHIBITS -----------------

Contact: Patricia A. Spinella/Investor Relations - 201-847-5453 Charles A. Borgognoni/Corporate Communications - 201-847-6651 BD ANNOUNCES FISCAL SECOND QUARTER RESULTS Company Increases Earnings Guidance For Fiscal Year 2003 Franklin Lakes, NJ (April 25, 2003) - BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported record quarterly revenues of $1.134 billion for the fiscal second quarter ended March 31, 2003, an increase of 12 percent from the same period a year ago. At constant foreign exchange rates, revenues increased 7 percent. Revenue growth in all segments benefited from favorable foreign currency translation, particularly with respect to the Euro. "We are pleased with our performance in the second quarter," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Strong revenue growth was driven, in particular, by our broad line of safety-engineered devices. Also this quarter, the Company launched significant new products - the BD Logic(TM) Blood Glucose Monitor, the BD Latitude(TM) Diabetes Management System and the BD FACSAria(TM) cell sorter. These introductions underscore our strategy of pursuing sustainable revenue growth by focusing on products that have a higher benefit to patients, healthcare workers and researchers." Diluted earnings per share and net income for the quarter were 54 cents and $142 million, respectively. For the same period in fiscal 2002, net income was $129 million and diluted earnings per share were 48 cents, or 50 cents excluding the impact of a special charge of 2 cents per share relating to the manufacturing restructuring in the BD Medical Systems segment. Q2 Segment Results - ------------------ In the BD Medical Systems segment, worldwide revenues of $602 million increased 13 percent. Included in BD Medical Systems revenues were U.S. safety-engineered product sales of $98 million, versus $85 million in the prior year's quarter. Also contributing to the growth of the segment were sales of prefillable drug delivery devices. The overall growth rate in the segment was partly offset by reduced sales of conventional devices in the U.S. due to the transition to safety-engineered devices. In the BD Clinical Laboratory Solutions segment, worldwide revenues increased 12 percent to $357 million. Revenue growth of 15 percent in the Preanalytical Solutions portion of the segment included U.S. safety-engineered device sales of $68 million, versus $50 million in the prior year's quarter. These results were partly offset by reduced sales of conventional devices due to the transition to safety-engineered devices.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues grew 6 percent to $175 million. Revenue growth was driven primarily by favorable foreign exchange as well as immunology/cell biology (Pharmingen) reagents and Discovery Labware products. This growth was offset in part by continued weaker demand for certain molecular biology (Clontech) reagents. As expected, sales of current flow cytometry instruments were negatively impacted as some customers decided to wait for the new BD FACSAria(TM) cell sorter, which began initial shipments at the end of March. Q2 Geographic Results - --------------------- On a geographic basis, second quarter revenues in the U.S. increased 6 percent to $578 million. Revenues outside the U.S. of $556 million grew 19 percent, or 9 percent at constant foreign exchange rates. International revenues in the second quarter benefited from favorable foreign exchange as well as strong performance in Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific, offset in part by the effects of continuing unfavorable economic conditions in Latin America. Six-month Results - ----------------- For the six-month period ended March 31, 2003, reported revenues were $2.186 billion, a 12 percent increase over a year ago, or 8 percent at constant foreign exchange rates. Diluted earnings per share for the six-month period were 97 cents. For the same period in fiscal 2002, diluted earnings per share were 85 cents, or 87 cents excluding the special charge relating to the manufacturing restructuring. West Pharmaceutical Services Update - ----------------------------------- BD has completed its assessment of the impacts resulting from the explosion on January 29, 2003 of the West Pharmaceutical Services facility in Kinston, NC. West is a supplier of rubber, plastic and metal components used in the manufacture of various BD products. West and BD successfully worked together under difficult circumstances following the explosion to minimize the impact on product supply to customers. The cost to BD in the second quarter was negligible, and the Company expects the impact for the balance of fiscal 2003 also to be negligible. Fiscal 2003 Outlook - ------------------- The Company increased its earnings guidance for fiscal 2003 from $2.09 to $2.12. For the third and fourth quarters, the Company expects diluted earnings per share of 54 cents and 61 cents, respectively. These expectations assume that U.S. dollar exchange rates, in particular related to the Euro, remain approximately at current levels. Conference Call Information - --------------------------- A conference call regarding BD's second quarter results and its expectations for the third and fourth quarters will be broadcast live on BD's website at www.bd.com at 8:30 a.m. (ET) Friday, April 25, 2003. The conference call will be available for replay on BD's website at www.bd.com/investors or at 1-800-945-6737 (domestic) and 1-402-220-3456 (international) through the close of business on May 2, 2003. This news release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in this release and in the attached financial tables.
BD is a medical technology company that serves healthcare institutions, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, industry and the general public.

Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure. The following statement is being furnished by the Company under the provisions of Regulation FD: BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) announced on July 23, 2003 that it is conducting a voluntary recall in Canada of three lots of BD'TM' Test Strips that were manufactured for use with the BD Latitude'TM' Diabetes Management System. The distribution of these three lots was limited to Canada, and represents a small percentage of total BD'TM' Test Strips produced to date. The costs anticipated with recalling these three lots are not expected to be significant and will be reflected in the Company's third quarter results for the period ended June 30, 2003. The sales value of the BD'TM' Test Strips being recalled in Canada is approximately U.S. $400,000. Total sales of BD'TM' Test Strips in the U.S. and Canada for the first half of BD's fiscal year 2003, for use with the BD Latitude'TM' Diabetes Management System and the BD Logic'TM' Blood Glucose Monitor, were approximately $5 million. BD is taking this action following an internal quality review, which determined that test strips from these three lots did not meet all of BD's quality and performance specifications. The potential issues presented by test strips from these lots relate primarily to the accuracy of readings at low blood glucose levels, especially for asymptomatic hypoglycemic patients. BD has not received any reports of serious injury resulting from inaccurate readings from test strips in these lots. The Company is advising the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Health Canada of this corrective action. BD is continuing its quality review of its BD'TM' Test Strips, will work with the FDA and Health Canada in connection with the issues associated with this announced recall and market notification process, and will take any other corrective actions that may be required. This report may contain certain forward-looking statements (as defined under Federal securities laws) regarding BD's performance, including future revenues, products and income, or events or developments that BD expects to occur or anticipates occurring in the future. All such statements are based upon current expectations of BD and involve a number of business risks and uncertainties. Actual results could vary materially from anticipated results described, implied or projected in any forward-looking statement. Factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from any forward-looking statement include, but are not limited to: competitive factors; pricing and market share pressures; uncertainties of litigation; BD's ability to achieve sales and earnings forecasts, which are based on sales volume and product mix assumptions, to achieve its cost savings objectives, and to achieve anticipated synergies and other cost savings in connection with acquisitions; changes in regional, national or foreign economic conditions; increases in energy costs; fluctuations in costs and availability of raw materials and in BD's ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships; changes in interest or foreign currency exchange rates; delays in product introductions; and changes in health care or other governmental regulation, as well as other factors discussed in this report and in BD's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. BD does not intend to update any forward-looking statements.

1 Becton Drive Franklin Lakes, NJ 07417 Tel: 201.847.4000 Fax: 201.847.6692 www.bd.com News Release [Becton, Dickinson and Company LOGO] Helping all people live healthy lives Contact: Charles A. Borgognoni/Corporate Communications - 201-847-6651 Patricia A. Spinella/Investor Relations - 201-847-5453 BD ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR FISCAL THIRD QUARTER Franklin Lakes, NJ (July 24, 2003) - BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported record quarterly revenues of $1.165 billion for the fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2003, an increase of 17 percent from the same period a year ago. At constant foreign exchange rates, revenues increased 11 percent. Revenue growth in all segments benefited from favorable foreign currency translation, particularly with respect to the Euro. Diluted earnings per share and net income for the quarter were 49 cents and $130 million, respectively. Included in third quarter results were non-cash charges of $34 million, recorded in cost of products sold, relating to the write-down of certain intangible assets and inventory in the BD Biosciences segment. These charges reduced net income by $20 million and diluted earnings per share by 8 cents. For the third quarter of fiscal 2002, diluted earnings per share were 44 cents and net income was $120 million, including special charges of $12 million, or 4 cents per share relating to the manufacturing restructuring in the BD Medical Systems segment. "Strong revenue growth in all three of our business segments, as well as in most of our international regions, was the driving force behind another sound quarter for BD," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Of the many products that added to this quarter's revenue growth, we were especially pleased by the contribution from the BD FACSAria'TM', our recently launched BD Biosciences instrument, which generated $20 million in revenue." Q3 Segment Results - ------------------ In the BD Medical Systems segment, worldwide revenues of $648 million increased 19 percent. The Medical Surgical, Pharmaceutical Systems and Consumer Healthcare units each contributed double-digit growth to the segment's results. Included in BD Medical Systems revenues were U.S. safety-engineered product sales of $101 million, versus $88 million in the prior year's quarter. The overall growth rate in the segment was offset in part by reduced sales of conventional devices in the U.S. due to the transition to safety-engineered devices.
In the BD Clinical Laboratory Solutions segment, worldwide revenues increased 13 percent to $338 million. Revenue growth of 11 percent in the Preanalytical Solutions unit of the segment was attributable in part to U.S. safety-engineered device sales, which were $66 million, versus $57 million in the prior year's quarter. These results were offset in part by reduced sales of conventional devices due to the transition to safety-engineered devices. Worldwide revenues of the Diagnostic Systems unit of the segment increased 17 percent. This growth reflected strong worldwide sales of its molecular diagnostic platform, BD ProbeTec'TM' ET. In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues grew 14 percent to $179 million. Revenue growth was driven by strong sales of the new BD FACSAria'TM' cell sorter, which BD Biosciences began shipping at the end of March, and by sales of immunology/cell biology reagents. This growth was offset in part by continued weaker demand for certain molecular biology (Clontech) reagents. Non-Cash Charges - ---------------- During the third quarter, the BD Biosciences segment discontinued the development of certain products and product applications associated with its BD IMAGN'TM' instrument platform. In connection with this decision, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $27 million for related intangible assets and inventory. In addition, as the result of a revised outlook with respect to under-performing portions of its molecular biology (Clontech) product line, BD Biosciences wrote down the value of related inventory and intellectual property by $7 million. In connection with the foregoing decisions, in the third quarter, the Company recorded, in cost of products sold, non-cash charges of $34 million. Q3 Geographic Results - --------------------- On a geographic basis, third quarter revenues in the U.S. increased 10 percent to $583 million. Revenues outside the U.S. of $582 million grew 24 percent, or 11 percent at constant foreign exchange rates. International revenues in the third quarter, benefited from favorable foreign exchange as well as strong performance in Europe, Canada, Japan, and Asia Pacific, offset in part by the effects of unfavorable performance and economic conditions in Latin America. Nine-Month Results - ------------------ For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2003, reported revenues were $3.351 billion, a 13 percent increase over a year ago, or 9 percent at constant foreign exchange rates. Diluted earnings per share for the nine-month period were $1.46, or $1.54 excluding the aforementioned non-cash charges relating to intangible asset impairments and inventory write-downs. For the same period in fiscal 2002, diluted earnings per share were $1.29, or $1.35 before the special charges related to the manufacturing restructuring in the BD Medical Systems segment. Fiscal 2003 Outlook - ------------------- For the fourth quarter, the Company expects diluted earnings per share of 60 cents, and $2.06 for the full fiscal year, or $2.14 excluding the 8 cents of non-cash charges relating to the intangible asset impairments and inventory write-downs included in the third quarter results. These expectations assume that foreign currency exchange rates, in particular as related to the Euro, remain approximately at current levels.

Notwithstanding anything in the first sentence of the preceding paragraph to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors is increased and there is no notice or public disclosure by the Company naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least 70 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 2.D. shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made. To be in proper written form, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must set forth (a) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and Rule 14a-11 thereunder (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected), (b) as to each matter such shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (c) the name and record address of such shareholder, (d) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Company that are owned beneficially or of record by such shareholder, (e) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such shareholder and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with -2-
such nomination or proposal of such business by such shareholder and any material interest of such shareholder in such business and (f) a representation that such shareholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such business before the meeting. No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of shareholders except business brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.D; provided, however, that, once business has been properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with such procedures, nothing in Section 2.D. shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any shareholder of any such business. If the Chairman of an annual meeting determines that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the Chairman shall declare to the meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting and such business shall not be transacted. SECTION 3. QUORUM. The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of shares representing a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at a meeting shall constitute a quorum. The shareholders present in person or by proxy at a duly organized meeting may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum. If a quorum not be present or represented at any meeting, the Chairman of the meeting or a majority of the shareholders present in person, or by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting without notice until the required voting shares shall be represented. At such adjourned meeting with the requisite amount of voting shares represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. SECTION 4. NOTICE OF MEETINGS. A written notice of each annual or special meeting of the shareholders of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board or the President or the Secretary, which shall state the time, place and purpose of such meeting, shall be delivered personally or mailed, not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days before the date of any such meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, the notice shall be directed to the shareholder at his address as it appears on the records of the stock transfer agent. Any shareholder, in person or by proxy, may at any time by a duly signed statement in writing to that effect, waive any statutory or other notice of any meeting, whether such statement be signed before or after such meeting. SECTION 5. VOTING. At all meetings of the shareholders, each holder of common stock having the right to vote, and present at the meeting in person or by proxy, shall be entitled to one vote for each full share of common stock of the Company entitled to vote and registered in his name. Each holder of preferred stock of any series shall have such voting powers, if any, as the Board of Directors shall have fixed by resolution prior to the issuance of any shares of such series. Whenever any action is to be taken by vote of the shareholders, it shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of the shareholders by the holders of shares entitled to vote, unless a greater plurality is required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation. -3-

SECTION 9. RECORD DATE FOR ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT. In order that the Corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in New Jersey, its principal place of business or to any officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action. Nothing in this Article II, Section 9 shall require the Board of Directors to take any action with respect to any proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought other than to fix a record date as provided for herein; and the fixing of any such record date shall not be deemed to be an action taken by the Board of Directors with -4-
respect to any such proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought for any other purpose. SECTION 10. INSPECTORS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by Article II, Section 9, to the Company of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Company shall engage nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Company that the consents delivered to the Company in accordance with Article II, Section 9 represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any shareholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation). SECTION 11. EFFECTIVENESS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each shareholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with Article II, Section 9, a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to the Company in the manner prescribed in Article II, Section 9.

Spinella, Investor Relations - 201-847-5453 BD Statement Regarding Voluntary National Recall of BD ProbeTec'TM' ------------------------------------------------------------------- ET Instrument ------------- Franklin Lakes, NJ (August 22, 2003) - BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE:BDX) today provided a summary of its voluntary product recall of the BD ProbeTec'TM' ET instrument for the detection of Chlamydia and gonorrhea, initiated July 21, 2003. Neither the costs anticipated with this recall, nor the impact on BD's ProbeTec'TM' ET instrument business, are expected to be significant. Last month, BD received one report from the field in the U.S. regarding a defect discovered in the course of instrument evaluation. An investigation by BD determined that the optical bundles may have been incorrectly installed in certain instruments, which could produce false positive and false negative results for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis with specimens from symptomatic and asymptomatic males and females. It was determined that this particular instrument produced 12 inaccurate results within the two week time period it was in use. The incorrect patient samples were identified, retested, and the physicians notified. BD initiated a field corrective action that included notifying customers worldwide and asking them to perform a test to verify the functioning of each instrument. To date, 522 units out of 526 distributed in the United States have been checked and found to be functioning correctly. The remaining four units will be tested by BD. Nearly 100% of the instruments worldwide (about 1000 units) have been tested, and only one additional defective unit used for patient testing has been identified, in Canada. BD is working directly with Health Canada to ensure that all appropriate parties are notified. BD has adopted additional quality checks and reviews of the optical bundle assembly process to prevent any potential recurrence. The instruments, manufactured since September 1998 and distributed through June 2003, have serial numbers 1001 through 2056. BD has notified Health Canada and the FDA and is working with them to coordinate recall activities. Patients, laboratories or physicians with questions can contact Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Systems at 1-800-638-8663, selection 2.
*** BD is a medical technology company that serves healthcare institutions, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, industry and the general public. BD manufactures and sells a broad range of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment and diagnostic products. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, BD reported total revenues of $4.033 billion. This press release may contain certain forward-looking statements (as defined under Federal securities laws) regarding BD's performance, including future revenues, products and income, or events or developments that BD expects to occur or anticipates occurring in the future. All such statements are based upon current expectations of BD and involve a number of business risks and uncertainties. Actual results could vary materially from anticipated results described, implied or projected in any forward-looking statement. Factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from any forward-looking statement include, but are not limited to: competitive factors; pricing and market share pressures; uncertainties of litigation; BD's ability to achieve sales and earnings forecasts, which are based on sales volume and product mix assumptions, to achieve its cost savings objectives, and to achieve anticipated synergies and other cost savings in connection with acquisitions; changes in regional, national or foreign economic conditions; increases in energy costs; fluctuations in costs and availability of raw materials and in BD's ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships; changes in interest or foreign currency exchange rates; delays in product introductions; and changes in health care or other governmental regulation, as well as other factors discussed in this press release and in BD's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not intend to update any forward-looking statements.

Contact: - -------- Charles A. Borgognoni/Corporate Communications - 201-847-6651 Patricia A. Spinella/Investor Relations - 201-847-5453 BD ANNOUNCES RECORD FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR REVENUES Franklin Lakes, NJ (November 6, 2003) - BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported record quarterly revenues of $1.177 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter ended September 30, 2003, an increase of 9 percent from the same period a year ago. For the full year, the Company reported record revenues of $4.528 billion, a 12 percent increase over a year ago. At constant foreign exchange rates, revenues increased 5 percent for the quarter and 8 percent for the fiscal year. Revenue growth in all segments benefited from favorable foreign currency translation, particularly with respect to the Euro, for the quarter and the year. Diluted earnings per share and net income for the quarter were 61 cents and $161 million, respectively. Diluted earnings per share and net income for the year were $2.07 and $547 million, respectively. Included in the full year results were non-cash charges recorded in the third quarter totaling 8 cents per share. These non-cash charges related to the write-down of certain intangible assets and inventory in the BD Biosciences segment. Excluding these charges, diluted earnings per share for the full year of fiscal 2003 would have been $2.15. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002 were 50 cents, which included a charge totaling 3 cents per share relating to the non-cash write-down of two equity investments resulting from a decline in market values. Excluding this charge, diluted earnings per share would have been 53 cents. In addition to the investment write-downs, diluted earnings per share for the full year of fiscal 2002 of $1.79 also included special charges recorded in the second and third quarters totaling 6 cents per share, related to the manufacturing restructuring in the BD Medical segment. Excluding charges, diluted earnings per share for the full year of fiscal 2002 would have been $1.88. "We accelerated growth and improved our operating effectiveness during the past year by driving innovation and productivity. Revenue growth for the year was driven, in particular, by our broad line of safety-engineered products, prefillable devices, the BD ProbeTec ET'TM', and the BD FACSAria'TM', our state-of-the-art BD Biosciences instrument," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Importantly, our investments in operational improvements worldwide are contributing to strong cash flow and higher gross profit margins. We are successfully implementing our strategy and we're seeing very tangible results."
Segment Results - --------------- In an effort to simplify and clarify the names of its business segments and units, the Company has announced the following changes, which became effective October 1, 2003. The three segment names are now BD Medical (formerly BD Medical Systems), BD Diagnostics (formerly BD Clinical Laboratory Solutions), and BD Biosciences (no change). Within BD Medical, unit name changes are Diabetes Care (formerly Consumer Healthcare), and Medical Surgical Systems (formerly Medical Surgical). Within BD Diagnostics, the only name change is Preanalytical Systems (formerly Preanalytical Solutions). Finally, within BD Biosciences, name changes are Immunocytometry Systems (formerly Flow Cytometry Instruments and Reagents), Clontech (formerly Molecular Biology Reagents), and Pharmingen (formerly Immunology/Cell Biology Reagents). In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues of $635 million increased 11 percent for the quarter. Included in these revenues were U.S. safety-engineered product sales of $108 million, versus $103 million in the prior year's quarter. U.S. sales of safety-engineered products for the full year totaled $407 million, versus $353 million in the prior year. The Pharmaceutical Systems unit contributed double-digit growth to the segment's results in the quarter and the full year. The overall growth rate in the segment for the quarter and the full year was partly offset by reduced sales of certain conventional devices in the U.S. due to the transition to safety-engineered devices. In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues increased 6 percent for the quarter to $347 million. Revenue growth of 7 percent in the Preanalytical Systems unit was due primarily to U.S. safety-engineered product sales, which were $74 million, versus $64 million in the prior year's quarter. U.S. sales of safety-engineered products for the full year totaled $273 million, versus $220 million in the prior year. Also contributing to the segment's performance were worldwide sales of Diagnostic Systems products, which increased by 6 percent, driven in large part by solid performance of its molecular diagnostic platform, the BD ProbeTec ET'TM'. The overall growth rate of the Preanalytical Systems unit was partly offset by reduced sales of certain conventional devices in the U.S. due to the transition to safety-engineered devices. In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues grew 10 percent to $195 million for the quarter. Revenue growth was driven by strong sales of the new BD FACSAria'TM' cell sorter, which BD Biosciences began shipping at the end of March 2003. This growth was offset in part by continued weak demand for certain Clontech reagents as well as a general slowdown in biotechnology research spending affecting our Pharmingen and Discovery Labware units. Geographic Results - ------------------ On a geographic basis, fourth quarter revenues in the U.S. increased 4 percent to $610 million. Revenues outside the U.S. of $567 million grew 15 percent, or 6 percent at constant foreign exchange rates. For the full year, revenues in the U.S. increased 8 percent to $2.328 billion. Revenues of $2.2 billion outside the U.S. increased by 17 percent, or 8 percent at constant foreign exchange rates.
Fiscal 2004 Outlook - ------------------- The Company estimates diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2004 will increase in the range of 10-12 percent, based on fiscal 2003 earnings per share of $2.15, which excludes non-cash charges as previously discussed. The Company estimates that first quarter diluted earnings per share will increase approximately 8-10 percent, based on fiscal first quarter 2003 diluted earnings per share of $0.43, reflecting the timing of investment spending on the blood glucose monitoring initiative. Conference Call Information - --------------------------- A conference call regarding BD's fourth quarter results and its expectations for the first quarter will be broadcast live on BD's website www.bd.com/investors at 8:30 a.m. (ET) Thursday, November 6, 2003. The conference call will be available for replay on BD's website www.bd.com/investors or at 1-888-566-0450 (domestic) and 1-402-998-0620 (international) through the close of business on November 13, 2003.

Spinella/Investor Relations - 201-847-5453 Colleen White/Corporate Communications - 201-847-5369 BD ANNOUNCES FISCAL FIRST QUARTER REVENUE AND EARNINGS GROWTH Results Include Charge of 11 Cents Per Share Related to Actions Taken In Connection With Blood Glucose Monitoring Products Franklin Lakes, NJ (January 29, 2004) - BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported record revenues of $1.2 billion for the fiscal first quarter ended December 31, 2003, an increase of 14 percent from the same period a year ago. Revenue growth in all segments benefited from favorable foreign currency translation, particularly with respect to the Euro. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, revenues increased 7 percent. Diluted earnings per share and net income for the quarter were 48 cents and $125 million, respectively. For the same period in fiscal 2003, diluted earnings per share and net income were 43 cents and $114 million, respectively. Included in the first quarter results of fiscal 2004 was a charge of $45 million related to certain actions taken in connection with our blood glucose monitoring products, which are sold by the BD Medical segment. This charge reduced net income by $28 million and diluted earnings per share by 11 cents. Excluding the charge of 11 cents, fully diluted earnings per share for the quarter were 59 cents.
"BD's strong underlying performance was the result of solid revenue growth and continued improvement in operating effectiveness. Sales growth was driven, in particular, by exceptionally strong sales of respiratory and flu diagnostic tests, as well as our broad line of safety-engineered products, immunocytometry instruments and reagents, and the BD ProbeTec'TM' ET system," said Edward J. Ludwig, BD Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We are also pleased that our gross profit margin, excluding the blood glucose monitoring charge, continues to improve." The $45 million charge for blood glucose monitoring products, recorded in cost of products sold, includes a reserve established in connection with the planned voluntary recall of certain lots of test strips, to be announced separately today, and the write-off of certain test strip inventories. The charge also reflects the Company's decision to focus its sales and marketing efforts on the BD Logic'TM' and Paradigm Link'TM' blood glucose meters, and to discontinue supply of the BD Latitude'TM' system product offering in the U.S., resulting in a write-off of related blood glucose meters and fixed assets. BD is undertaking the product recall and related inventory write-off as a result of a product performance issue that recently emerged. The issue involves an increase in the frequency of "E3" messages during blood glucose testing. E3 messages are a protective feature of the meter to signal that the meter is unable to obtain a reading from the test strip for various reasons. Based upon internal testing, it was determined that certain test strip lots were not performing within BD's specifications for E3 messages. To maintain the highest product quality standards and ensure customer satisfaction, BD decided to recall the affected lots and dispose of non-conforming product in inventory. BD has a sufficient remaining quantity of test strips in
inventory to replace the recalled product and to continue supplying the market. As a result, the Company anticipates that any customer impacts from these actions will be short term in nature. Segment Results In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues of $627 million increased 10 percent in the quarter, driven by U.S. safety-engineered product sales of $112 million, versus $100 million in the prior year's quarter. The overall growth rate in the segment was partly affected by reduced sales of certain conventional devices in the U.S. due to the transition to safety-engineered devices and sales growth in the Pharmaceutical Systems unit being lower than recent quarters. In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues increased 21 percent for the quarter to $401 million. Revenue growth of 11 percent in the Preanalytical Systems unit of the segment was due primarily to strong U.S. safety-engineered product sales, which were $76 million, versus $65 million in the prior year's quarter, and which were partly affected by reduced sales of certain conventional devices in the U.S. due to the transition to safety-engineered devices. Revenues in the Diagnostic Systems unit of the segment grew 31 percent based on exceptionally strong sales of respiratory and flu diagnostic tests in Japan and the U.S., and an increase in worldwide sales of the BD ProbeTec'TM' ET molecular diagnostic platform. Revenues in the BD Biosciences segment grew 16 percent to $172 million for the quarter. These results reflected strong sales of the BD FACSAria'TM' cell sorter, which BD Biosciences began shipping at the end of the second fiscal quarter of 2003, along with strong sales of flow cytometry reagents. This growth was partly affected by continued weak demand of certain Clontech reagents.
Geographic Results On a geographic basis, first quarter revenues in the U.S. increased 6 percent to $592 million. Revenues outside the U.S. of $608 million grew 23 percent, or 9 percent at constant foreign exchange rates. International revenues in the first quarter benefited from strong performance in Japan, which experienced exceptionally strong sales of respiratory and flu diagnostic tests. Fiscal 2004 Outlook The Company estimates diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2004, including the charge of 11 cents per share for blood glucose monitoring products, will increase in the range of 10 to12 percent. This estimate is based on fiscal 2003 pro forma earnings per share of $2.15, which excludes 8 cents of non-cash charges related to the write-down of certain intangible assets and inventory in the BD Biosciences segment. The Company estimates that second quarter diluted earnings per share will increase approximately 10 to 12 percent, based on fiscal second quarter 2003 diluted earnings per share of $0.54.

[Letterhead] NEWS RELEASE [BECTON DICKINSON LOGO] Contact: Colleen White, Corporate Communications - 201-847-5369 Patricia Spinella, Investor Relations - 201-847-5453 BD Initiates Voluntary Recall of Certain BD'TM' Test Strips FRANKLIN LAKES, NJ (January 29, 2004) - BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE:BDX) announced today that it has initiated a voluntary product recall of certain lots of its BD'TM' Test Strips used for blood glucose monitoring. These lots may produce an increased frequency of "E-3" messages when used during blood glucose testing. The E-3 message is a protective feature of the meter that appears during a test to indicate issues with the application of a blood sample or with the test strip. This message does not cause erroneous test results, as no test result is shown when the E-3 message is displayed. To maintain the highest product quality standards and ensure customer satisfaction, BD is performing this recall and replacing strips from all affected lots. BD has a sufficient remaining quantity of test strips in inventory to replace the recalled product and to continue supplying the market. BD is informing its customers, including distributors, retailers and healthcare professionals, about this situation and has outlined steps for replacement of test strips from affected lots. Patient safety and the efficacy of its products are BD's first priorities. Customers with questions or concerns can call BD toll-free at 1-866-556-8123. BD is a medical technology company that serves healthcare institutions, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, industry and the general public. BD manufactures and sells a broad range of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment and diagnostic products. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, BD reported total revenues of $4.528 billion. *** This press release may contain certain forward-looking statements (as defined under Federal securities laws) regarding BD's performance, including future revenues, products and income, or events or developments that BD expects to occur or anticipates occurring in the future. All such statements are based upon current expectations of BD and involve a number of business risks and uncertainties. Actual results could vary materially from anticipated results described, implied or projected in any forward-looking statement. Factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from any forward-looking statement include, but are not limited to: competitive factors; pricing and market share pressures; uncertainties of litigation; BD's ability to achieve sales and earnings forecasts, which are based on sales volume and product mix assumptions, to achieve
its cost savings objectives, and to achieve anticipated synergies and other cost savings in connection with acquisitions; changes in regional, national or foreign economic conditions; increases in energy costs; fluctuations in costs and availability of raw materials and in BD's ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships; changes in interest or foreign currency exchange rates; delays in product introductions; and changes in health care or other governmental regulation, as well as other factors discussed in this press release and in BD's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not intend to update any forward-looking statements.

1 Becton Drive Franklin Lakes, NJ 07417 www.bd.com News Release [BD LOGO] Helping all people live healthy lives Contact: Patricia A. Spinella, Investor Relations - 201-847-5453 Colleen White, Corporate Communications - 201-847-5369 BD ANNOUNCES FISCAL SECOND QUARTER RESULTS Franklin Lakes, NJ (April 22, 2004) - BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported record quarterly revenues of $1.271 billion for the fiscal second quarter ended March 31, 2004, an increase of 12 percent from the same period a year ago. At constant foreign exchange rates, revenues increased 6 percent. Revenue growth in all segments benefited from favorable foreign currency translation, particularly with respect to the Euro. "We are pleased with the Company's continued strong performance in the second quarter. Solid revenue growth in our BD Medical and BD Biosciences segments reflects contributions from several key areas - prefillable drug delivery devices, diabetes related products and our BD FACSAria'TM' cell sorter," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Strong revenue growth in nearly all of our international regions was another driving force." Diluted earnings per share and net income for the quarter were 62 cents and $165 million, respectively. For the same period in fiscal 2003, diluted earnings per share were 54 cents and net income was $142 million. Q2 Segment Results In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $683 million, representing an increase of 13 percent over the prior year period. Included in BD Medical revenues were U.S. safety-engineered product sales of $107 million, as compared with $98 million in the prior year's quarter, which was offset in part by reduced sales of certain conventional devices in the U.S. due to the transition to safety-engineered devices. Also contributing to the growth of the segment were increased sales of diabetes related products and prefillable drug delivery devices. In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $383 million, representing an increase of 7 percent over the prior year period. Revenue growth of 11 percent in the Preanalytical Systems unit of the segment included U.S. safety-engineered device sales of $75 million, compared with $68 million in the prior year's quarter, which was offset in part by reduced sales of conventional devices in the U.S. due to the transition to safety-engineered devices. After having experienced a 31 percent increase in the first quarter, due in large part to earlier than usual and exceptionally strong sales of respiratory and flu diagnostic tests in the U.S. and Japan, revenues in the Diagnostic Systems unit of the segment increased 3 percent in the second quarter. For the first half of fiscal 2004, the Diagnostic Systems unit reported 17 percent revenue growth.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues were $205 million, representing an increase of 17 percent over the prior year period. These results reflected broad market acceptance of the BD FACSAria'TM' cell sorter, which BD Biosciences began shipping at the end of the second fiscal quarter of 2003, along with strong sales of flow cytometry reagents in the Immunocytometry Systems and Pharmingen units. Revenue growth was also driven by Discovery Labware products. Q2 Geographic Results Second quarter revenues in the U.S. of $619 million represented an increase of 7 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside the U.S. of $651 million represented an increase of 17 percent over the prior year period, or 4 percent at constant foreign exchange rates. International revenues in the second quarter benefited from favorable foreign exchange in substantially all regions. Excluding the impact of favorable foreign exchange, revenues increased in substantially all regions. Six-month Results For the six-month period ended March 31, 2004, reported revenues were $2.470 billion, a 13 percent increase over the same period a year ago, or 6 percent at constant foreign exchange rates. Diluted earnings per share for the six-month period were $1.10. For the same period in fiscal 2003, diluted earnings per share were 97 cents. Included in the first half results of fiscal 2004 was a first quarter charge of 11 cents related to certain actions taken in connection with our blood glucose monitoring products. Excluding the charge of 11 cents, pro forma diluted earnings per share for the first half of fiscal 2004 were $1.21. Fiscal 2004 Outlook The Company estimates that its reported diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2004, which includes a charge of 11 cents per share relating to its blood glucose monitoring products, will increase in the range of 10 to 12 percent over the prior period. This estimate is based on fiscal 2003 pro forma earnings per share of $2.15, which excludes 8 cents of non-cash charges related to the write-down of certain intangible assets and inventory in the BD Biosciences segment.

Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure. The following statement is being furnished by the Company under the provisions of Regulation FD: On May 25, 2004, Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD"), exercised options for 38,542 BD shares and sold 32,512 of the acquired shares. On May 27, 2004, Mr. Ludwig also entered into a pre-arranged trading plan (the "Plan") established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and BD's policies with respect to stock transactions. Pursuant to the Plan, Mr. Ludwig intends to exercise options for 160,000 shares, and to sell 152,000 of the shares acquired upon exercise, over an eight-month period beginning in July 2004. The shares will be sold on the open market at prevailing market prices, subject to a minimum price threshold. The transactions announced today are part of Mr. Ludwig's long-term financial strategy for prudent asset diversification and liquidity. The options exercised by Mr. Ludwig and the options covered under Mr. Ludwig's trading plan collectively represent approximately 19% of the vested options and 13% of the total options held by Mr. Ludwig. All of these were granted in January 1996 and would otherwise expire in January 2006, except for 4,030 options that were exercised and the underlying shares retained by Mr. Ludwig. These options were granted in January 1997 and were due to expire in January 2007. Excluding the options covered by the Plan, Mr. Ludwig holds additional options to acquire 1,283,147 BD shares. As a result of the transaction on May 25, 2004 described above, Mr. Ludwig currently beneficially owns approximately 145,423 shares of BD (excluding shares that may be acquired under stock options). As a result of such holdings, Mr. Ludwig satisfies the BD share ownership guidelines, which require BD's CEO to own shares equal in value to at least five times the CEO's salary. Mr. Ludwig has also elected, on a discretionary basis, to defer approximately $100,000 of his 2004 salary into a BD stock account under BD's deferred compensation plan. Rule 10b5-1 allows corporate officers who are not aware of material, non-public information to adopt written, pre-arranged trading plans. Individuals may use these plans to diversify their investment portfolios over time. Mr. Ludwig, as well as other BD officers and directors, may adopt similar plans in the future. BD does not undertake to report Rule 10b5-1 plans that may be adopted by any officers or directors of BD in the future, or to report any modifications or termination of any publicly announced plan, except to the extent required by law.

Exhibit 99.1 Contact: - -------- Patricia A. Spinella, Investor Relations - 201-847-5453 Colleen T. White, Corporate Communications - 201-847-5369 BD ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR FISCAL THIRD QUARTER Franklin Lakes, NJ (July 22, 2004) - BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported quarterly revenues of $1.258 billion for the fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2004, representing an increase of 8 percent from the same period a year ago. At constant foreign exchange rates, revenues increased 5 percent. Revenue growth in all segments benefited from favorable foreign currency translation, particularly with respect to the Euro. Diluted earnings per share and net income for the quarter were 41 cents and $109 million, respectively. As announced in our July 2, 2004 press release, third quarter results included a pre-tax charge of $100 million relating to the agreement with Retractable Technologies, Inc. to settle its lawsuit against BD. This charge reduced net income by $63 million and diluted earnings per share by 24 cents. For the third quarter of fiscal 2003, reported diluted earnings per share and net income were 49 cents and $130 million, respectively. Included in these prior period results was a charge of $34 million related to the write-down of certain intangible assets and inventory in the BD Biosciences segment. This charge reduced diluted earnings per share by 8 cents and net income by $20 million. Excluding the charge of 8 cents, pro forma diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 were 57 cents. "These results reflect another solid quarter of revenue and earnings growth, fueled especially by sales of safety-engineered products and immunocytometry instruments and reagents, along with improved gross profit margins," stated Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "In addition, having settled the lawsuit, we can now concentrate all of our efforts on driving revenue growth through innovation focused on products that have a higher benefit to patients, healthcare workers and researchers." Q3 Segment Results In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $683 million, representing an increase of 5 percent over the prior year period. BD Medical revenues reflect the continued conversion in the U.S. to safety-engineered products, which had sales of $110 million, as compared with $101 million in the prior year's quarter. The BD Medical sales growth rate was constrained by comparison to a particularly strong quarter in fiscal 2003.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $374 million, representing an increase of 11 percent over the prior year period. Revenue growth of 12 percent in the Preanalytical Systems unit of the segment reflects the continued conversion in the U.S. to safety-engineered devices which had sales of $80 million, compared with $66 million in the prior year's quarter. Revenue growth of 9 percent in the Diagnostic Systems unit of the segment included solid worldwide sales of its molecular diagnostic platform, BD ProbeTec'TM' ET. In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $201 million, representing an increase of 12 percent over the prior year period. Instrument revenue growth was driven by sales of the recently launched BD FACSCanto'TM' and BD FACSArray'TM' analyzers and continued strong performance of the BD FACSAria'TM' cell sorter. Sales of flow cytometry reagents were also strong in both the clinical and the research markets. Q3 Geographic Results Third quarter revenues in the U.S. of $617 million represented an increase of 6 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside the U.S. of $641 million represented an increase of 10 percent over the prior year period, or 4 percent at constant foreign exchange rates. Nine-Month Results For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2004, reported revenues were $3.728 billion, an 11 percent increase over the same period a year ago, or 6 percent at constant foreign exchange rates. Reported diluted earnings per share for the nine-month period were $1.51. Included in the nine-month results of fiscal 2004 was a first quarter charge of 11 cents related to certain actions taken in connection with our blood glucose monitoring products and a third quarter charge of 24 cents related to the previously mentioned litigation settlement. Excluding both these charges, pro forma diluted earnings per share for the nine-month period were $1.86. For the same nine-month period in fiscal 2003, reported diluted earnings per share were $1.46. Excluding the aforementioned charge of 8 cents related to the write-down of certain intangible assets and inventory in the BD Biosciences segment, pro forma diluted earnings per share for the nine-month period in fiscal 2003 were $1.54. Fiscal 4Q 2004 Outlook For the fourth quarter, the Company expects reported diluted earnings per share will increase about 10 percent. Conference Call Information A conference call regarding BD's third quarter results and its expectations for the fourth quarter will be broadcast live on BD's website www.bd.com/investors at 10:00 a.m. (ET) Thursday, July 22, 2004.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition. On October 4, 2004, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing that its Board of Directors had approved a plan to sell BD's Clontech operation. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. On September 30, 2004, the Board of Directors of BD approved a plan to sell BD's Clontech operation, a unit of the BD Biosciences segment. The plan to divest Clontech is a result of BD Bioscience's decision to focus its strategy on cell analysis, discovery labware and its new platforms of imaging and in vitro drug metabolism/toxicity testing. BD expects to complete the divestiture of Clontech in the second quarter of BD's 2005 fiscal year. Goldman Sachs & Company is acting as BD's financial advisor in connection with the planned sale. BD estimates that it will record a pre-tax loss in its 2004 fiscal fourth quarter of approximately $125 million ($115 million after-tax), or approximately $0.44 per share, in connection with the planned sale. This charge, other than for certain immaterial cash costs of approximately $2 million, consists of non-cash charges relating to the write down of the business' assets (primarily intangible assets) to fair value. The above estimates of the charges to be incurred in connection with the planned sale of Clontech are based upon current expectations of BD and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual charges could vary materially from BD's estimates. Factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from BD's estimates include, but are not limited to, BD's ability to successfully complete the proposed divestiture within the expected timeframe, and the structure of any transaction involving a divestiture of Clontech and the purchase price and other terms relating thereto. BD does not intend to update any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof, except as required by applicable laws or regulations.

1 Becton Drive Franklin Lakes, NJ 07417 www.bd.com [BECTON DICKINSON LOGO] Contact: - -------- Patricia A. Spinella, Investor Relations - 201-847-5453 Colleen T. White, Corporate Communications - 201-847-5369 BD ANNOUNCES FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR RESULTS Franklin Lakes, NJ (November 4, 2004) - BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported quarterly revenues from continuing operations of $1.253 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter ended September 30, 2004, representing an increase of 8 percent from the same period a year ago. For the full year, the Company reported record revenues of $4.935 billion from continuing operations, which represents an 11 percent increase over the same period a year ago. At constant foreign exchange rates, revenues increased 5 percent for the quarter and 6 percent for the fiscal year. Revenue growth in all segments benefited from favorable foreign currency translation, particularly with respect to the Euro, for the quarter and the year. "We had a strong finish to a successful year in which BD exceeded its operating goals and showed significant improvement over 2003," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "In the fourth quarter, all segments contributed solid revenue growth, resulting in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 70 cents, which exceeded our expectations. For the year, pro forma gross profit margin improvement of 100 basis points and cash flow from operations of over $1 billion were driven by a combination of revenue growth, continued operating effectiveness and productivity improvement." Reported diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were 26 cents, which reflected diluted earnings per share of 70 cents from continuing operations, and a loss of 44 cents per share from discontinued operations. Reported diluted earnings per share for the year were $1.77, which reflected diluted earnings per share of $2.21 from continuing operations, and a loss of 44 cents per share from discontinued operations. Included in the results of continuing operations for the year were a first quarter charge of 11 cents related to our blood glucose monitoring products and a third quarter charge of 24 cents related to the settlement of the Retractable Technologies, Inc. litigation. Excluding these items, pro forma diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2004 were $2.56. Reconciliations of these pro forma financial measures and other financial measures discussed in this release are provided in the tables below.
Planned Sale of Clontech Operation On October 4, 2004, BD announced that a plan had been initiated to offer Clontech, a unit of the BD Biosciences segment, for sale. The results of operations for Clontech have been classified as "discontinued operations" for all quarters and years referred to in this release. In connection with the planned disposition, BD has recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of 44 cents per diluted share in the results of discontinued operations, reflecting the write-down of Clontech's net assets to estimated fair value. Also included in the results of discontinued operations for the quarter and the year were a loss from operations of $0.1 million and income from operations of $0.7 million, respectively, resulting in an impact of less than 1 cent on reported diluted earnings per share for the quarter and the year. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2003 Reported diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003 were 61 cents, which included a net loss from discontinued operations of $0.9 million (less than 1 cent diluted earnings per share). Reported diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2003 were $2.07 and reflected diluted earnings per share of $2.10 from continuing operations and a loss of 3 cents per share from discontinued operations. The loss from discontinued operations included 2 cents per diluted share related to the write-down of certain intangible assets and inventory and 1 cent per diluted share of operating loss. Also reflected in the full fiscal year 2003 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were additional charges of 6 cents per diluted share related to the write-down of certain intangible assets and inventory in the BD Biosciences segment unrelated to Clontech. Excluding this 6 cents charge per diluted share, pro forma diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2003 were $2.16. Reconciliations of Reported Results The following tables are provided to assist in reconciling reported diluted earnings per share to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and pro forma diluted earnings per share from continuing operations:
Reconciliation from Reported Diluted Earnings Per Share to Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations and Pro Forma Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations (1) Loss from FY2004 Discontinued Operations of $(0.1) Million is less than $(0.01) Diluted EPS. (2) Loss from FY2003 Discontinued Operations of $(0.9) Million is less than $(0.01) Diluted EPS, however, due to rounding, Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations is $0.01 higher than Reported Diluted EPS. - --------------------------------------------------------------------------- (3) Income from FY2004 Discontinued Operations of $0.7 Million is less than $0.01 Diluted EPS. Loss from FY2003 Discontinued Operations of $(3.8) Million represents $0.01 Diluted EPS. (4) Total of $0.08 relates to charges in the third quarter of FY2003, reflecting write-down of certain intangible assets and inventory in the BD Biosciences segment, of which $0.02 is related to Clontech.
Segment Results In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $688 million, representing an increase of 8 percent over the prior year period. BD Medical revenues reflect the continued conversion in the U.S. to safety-engineered products, accounting for sales of $118 million compared with $108 million in the prior year's quarter. Also contributing to the growth of the segment were sales of prefillable drug delivery devices, which grew to $126 million from $101 million in the prior year's quarter. U.S. sales of safety-engineered products for the full year in the BD Medical segment totaled $448 million compared with $407 million in the prior year. BD Medical worldwide revenues for the year were $2.680 billion, representing an increase of 9 percent over the prior year. In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $374 million, representing an increase of 8 percent over the prior year period. Revenue growth of 12 percent in the Preanalytical Systems unit of the segment reflects the continued conversion in the U.S. to safety-engineered products, accounting for sales of $85 million, compared with $74 million in the prior year's quarter. U.S. sales of safety-engineered products for the full year in the BD Diagnostics segment totaled $317 million compared with $273 million in the prior year. Total U.S. sales of safety-engineered products for the full year were $765 million compared with $680 million in the prior year, representing an increase of 13 percent. Revenue growth in the Diagnostic Systems unit of the segment was 3 percent for the quarter. Sales of the unit's molecular diagnostic platform, the BD ProbeTec'TM' ET system, continued to contribute to its growth, while sales of respiratory and flu diagnostic tests for the quarter were lower than the prior year's period due to a shift in the timing of distributor purchases, which are expected to occur over the next two quarters. In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the full fiscal year were $1.532 billion, representing an increase of 12 percent over the prior year. In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues from continuing operations for the quarter were $192 million, representing an increase of 7 percent over the prior year period. Instrument revenue growth was driven by sales of the recently launched BD FACSCanto'TM' and BD FACSArray'TM' analyzers and continued strong market acceptance of the BD FACSAria'TM' cell sorter. Fourth quarter sales of flow cytometry reagents were also strong in both the clinical and research markets. BD Biosciences worldwide revenues for the year were $723 million, representing an increase of 14 percent over the prior year. As previously discussed, revenue results exclude sales from the Clontech business unit. Geographic Results Fourth quarter revenues in the U.S. of $631 million represented an increase of 5 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside the U.S. of $622 million represented an increase of 11 percent over the prior year period, or 6 percent at constant foreign exchange rates. For the full year, revenues in the U.S. of $2.436 billion represented an increase of 6 percent over the prior year. Revenues outside the U.S. of $2.499 billion increased by 15 percent, or 6 percent at constant foreign exchange rates. Fiscal 2005 Outlook The Company estimates pro forma diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 will increase in the range of 10 to 12 percent as compared with fiscal 2004 pro forma diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.56, excluding the anticipated impact of expensing equity-based compensation as described below.
The Company also estimates that first quarter 2005 pro forma diluted earnings per share from continuing operations will increase about 7 percent, compared with fiscal first quarter 2004 pro forma diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 58 cents, which excludes the previously noted charge of 11 cents per diluted share related to our blood glucose monitoring products. Anticipated first quarter growth is affected by the timing of respiratory and flu diagnostic sales, which occurred in the fiscal first quarter of last year due to an early expectation of an unusually severe flu season. Equity-Based Compensation The Company anticipates that it will adopt, in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the fair value recognition provisions for stock-based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," as amended by SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure." As a result, prior unvested stock options and new equity-based awards issued pursuant to the Company's previously approved long-term incentive program (which replaces, in part, grants of stock options with performance-based stock awards and restricted stock units), will begin to be expensed. These changes, in the aggregate, are estimated to reduce full year fiscal 2005 pro forma diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by about 6 percent. Conference Call Information A conference call regarding BD's fourth quarter and full year results and expectations for fiscal 2005 will be broadcast live on BD's website (www.bd.com/investors) at 10:00 a.m. (ET) Thursday, November 4, 2004.

Spinella, Investor Relations - 201-847-5453 BD BOARD DECLARES DIVIDEND INCREASE AND AUTHORIZES ADDITIONAL SHARE REPURCHASES Franklin Lakes, NJ (November 23, 2004) - The Board of Directors of BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE:BDX) has declared a quarterly dividend of 18 cents per common share, an increase of 3 cents per share or 20% from the previous quarter. The dividend will be payable on January 3, 2005 to holders of record on December 13, 2004. At the current rate, the annual dividend would be 72 cents per share, a rise of 20% from a year ago. The Board has also authorized the Company to repurchase up to 10 million common shares of the Company. The Company plans to use the shares for general corporate purposes. This authorization is in addition to the approximately 4.1 million shares that remained available at September 30, 2004 under a 10 million-share repurchase authorization approved in January 2004. On September 30, 2004, the Company had approximately 249 million common shares outstanding. The Company said the new authorization is consistent with continued strong cash flow. "This is the 32nd year in a row that BD has increased its dividends. Our dividend, along with the repurchasing of our shares, has allowed us to return significant dollars to our shareholders," said Edward J. Ludwig, BD Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "This provides evidence that the strategy we have been implementing over the last several years is working. We're continuing to pursue this strategy of growth through innovation combined with operational effectiveness, and our shareholders will continue to be the beneficiaries." BD is a medical technology company that serves healthcare institutions, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, industry and the general public. BD manufactures and sells a broad range of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment and diagnostic products. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, BD reported total revenues of $4.935 billion. ***

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition. On January 26, 2005, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the first fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2005. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those under U.S. generally accepted accounting principals (GAAP), as follows: o We present revenue growth rates at constant foreign exchange rates. We believe that presenting growth rates at constant foreign exchange rates allows investors to view the underlying operating results of BD and of its segments without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating comparisons to prior periods. o We present earnings per share and other financial measures after excluding the impact of significant charges, and the impact of unusual or non-recurring items. We believe that excluding such impact from these financial measures allows investors to more easily compare BD's financial performance with prior period performance and to understand the operating results of BD without the effects of these significant charges and unusual or non-recurring items. o We present earnings per share and other financial measures after excluding the impact of share-based compensation expense for the period, to the extent such period is being compared to a prior period where such expense was either not recognized or was immaterial. We believe that excluding these expenses, which are non-cash items, allows investors to more easily compare BD's financial performance with prior period performance. o We present earnings per share and other financial measures after excluding the effects of changes in tax laws and regulations (including without limitation, rate changes) and other events that cause the tax rate for the period being presented to vary from the Company's expected effective tax rate for the full fiscal year. We believe that excluding such effects facilitates comparisons of BD's financial performance with prior period performance. BD's management considers these non-GAAP financial measures internally in evaluating BD's performance. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

News Release [BECTON DICKINSON LOGO] Contact: Patricia A. Spinella, Investor Relations - 201-847-5453 Colleen T. White, Corporate Communications - 201-847-5369 BD ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR FISCAL FIRST QUARTER Franklin Lakes, NJ (January 26, 2005) - BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported record quarterly revenues of $1.288 billion for the fiscal first quarter ended December 31, 2004, representing an increase of 9 percent from the same period a year ago. At constant foreign exchange rates, revenues increased 6 percent for the quarter. Revenue growth in all segments benefited from favorable foreign currency translation, particularly with respect to the Euro. "We're off to a strong start for fiscal 2005 with all business segments contributing solid results. Our global revenue growth, disciplined cost control and supply chain productivity continue to deliver earnings increases," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "This strong performance is enabling us to increase our investments in innovation and growth for the future." Reported diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were 75 cents. On October 4, 2004, BD announced that a plan had been initiated to offer Clontech, a unit of the BD Biosciences segment, for sale; therefore, the results of operations from Clontech have been classified as "discontinued operations." Income from discontinued operations for the first quarter of $1.0 million is less than 1 cent per diluted share; however, due to rounding, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 74 cents.
Analyses of First Quarter Fiscal Year 2005 and 2004 Earnings The following analyses of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations have been provided to reconcile to pro forma diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarters of fiscal 2005 and 2004. (1) Included in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 is approximately 4 cents per diluted share due to the reversal of tax reserves in connection with the conclusion of tax examinations in four non-U.S. jurisdictions. (2) Represents the effect on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of tax-related events that caused the quarter's tax rate to vary from the expected effective tax rate for the year. The expected effective tax rate for the year, without taking into account the tax impact of the items described in notes (1) and (3) herein, is 25.5%. (3) Included in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is approximately 3 cents per diluted share related to share-based compensation expense recorded in connection with the early adoption of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised), and the restricted stock awards granted under the new long-term incentive program, both of which occurred this quarter and are described below. (4) Included in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is a charge of 11 cents per diluted share related to the voluntary recall and write-off of certain blood glucose strip inventory and other actions taken with respect to our blood glucose monitoring products. Based on the foregoing analyses, pro forma diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 71 cents for the fiscal first quarter of 2005 increased by 22 percent over pro forma diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 58 cents for the fiscal first quarter of 2004. Share-Based Compensation As planned, effective October 1, 2004, the Company adopted FASB Statement No.123 (revised) relating to the expensing of share-based incentive awards. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter included 3 cents of share-based compensation expense associated with the adoption and the restricted stock awards granted under the new long-term incentive program, which consisted of a mix of performance-based restricted stock awards, time-vested restricted stock awards and stock options or stock appreciation rights. We estimate that total share-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2005 will be about 17 cents per diluted share. Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $694 million, representing an increase of 11 percent over the prior year period. BD Medical revenues reflect the continued conversion in the U.S. to safety-engineered products, accounting for sales of $126 million compared with $114 million in the prior year's quarter. Included in BD Medical revenues were international sales of safety-engineered products of $18 million, compared with $14 million in the prior year's quarter. Also contributing to the growth of the segment were strong sales in the Diabetes Care unit. In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $414 million, representing an increase of 3 percent over the prior year period. Revenue growth of 13 percent in the Preanalytical Systems unit of the segment reflects the continued conversion in the U.S. to safety-engineered products, accounting for sales of $86 million, compared with $76 million in the prior year's quarter. Included in Preanalytical Systems revenues were international sales of safety-engineered products of $42 million, compared with $29 million in the prior year's quarter. As anticipated, and despite strong sales from the BD ProbeTec'TM' ET and BD Phoenix'TM' instruments, revenues in the Diagnostic Systems unit of the segment declined 5 percent from the prior year's quarter. The first quarter of fiscal 2004 benefited from exceptionally strong sales of flu tests in Japan and the U.S., which did not recur in this year's fiscal first quarter. In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues from continuing operations for the quarter were $181 million, representing an increase of 15 percent over the prior year period. Instrument revenue growth was primarily driven by sales of the recently launched BD FACSCanto'TM' analyzer. Continued strong market acceptance of the BD FACSAria'TM' cell sorter also contributed to sales. First quarter sales of flow cytometry reagents were also strong in both the clinical and research markets. Geographic Results First quarter revenues in the U.S. of $624 million represented an increase of 7 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside the U.S. of $664 million represented an increase of 11 percent over the prior year period, or 5 percent at constant foreign exchange rates.
Fiscal 2005 Outlook for Second Quarter and Full Year The following analyses of estimated diluted earnings per share from continuing operations have been provided to reconcile to estimated pro forma diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fiscal 2005 second quarter and full year. (1) Fiscal 2005 second quarter and full year estimated diluted earnings per share from continuing operations do not include the impact on taxes that would result if the Company were to repatriate certain undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. (2) Represents diluted earnings per share from continuing operations due to the reversal of tax reserves in the first quarter in connection with the conclusion of tax examinations in four non-U.S. jurisdictions. (3) Represents the effect on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of tax-related events that causes the quarter's tax rate to vary from the expected effective tax rate for the year. The expected effective tax rate for the year, without taking into account the tax impact of the items described in notes (1), (2) and (4) herein, is 25.5%. (4) Represents the effect on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations relating to share-based compensation expense associated with the early adoption of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised), and the restricted stock awards granted under the new long-term incentive program. (5) Included in full year fiscal 2004 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was a third quarter charge of 24 cents per diluted share related to the settlement of the Retractable Technologies, Inc. litigation, in addition to the previously noted first quarter BGM charge of 11 cents per diluted share. The Company estimates that second quarter 2005 pro forma diluted earnings per share from continuing operations will increase in the range of 13 to 16 percent as compared with fiscal second quarter 2004 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 62 cents. The Company also estimates pro forma diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 will increase in the range of 13 to 15 percent compared with fiscal 2004 pro forma diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.56.

SECTION 2. A. ANNUAL MEETINGS.

C. SPECIAL MEETINGS. Special meetings of the shareholders may be called by the Board of Directors or by the Chairman of the Board or by the President, and shall be called by the Chairman of the Board or by the President upon written request of a majority of the Directors then in office, which request shall state the time, place and purpose of the meeting. D. ADVANCE NOTICE OF NOMINATIONS AND BUSINESS TO BE TRANSACTED AT ANNUAL MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS. No business may be transacted at an annual meeting of shareholders, other than business that is either (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof), (b) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or (c) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by any shareholder of the Company (i) who is a shareholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 2.D. and on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote at such annual meeting and (ii) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.D.
In addition to any other applicable requirements, for nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors or for other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder, such shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the Company. To be timely, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Company not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders; provided however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for on a date that is not within 30 days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder in order to be timely must be so received not earlier than the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of shareholder's notice as described above. Notwithstanding anything in the first sentence of the preceding paragraph to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors is increased and there is no notice or public disclosure by the Company naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least 70 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 2.D. shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made. To be in proper written form, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must set forth (a) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and Rule 14a-11 thereunder (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected), (b) as to each matter such shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (c) the name and record address of such shareholder, (d) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Company that are owned beneficially or of record by such shareholder, (e) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such shareholder and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with such nomination or proposal of such business by such shareholder and any material interest of such shareholder in such business and (f) a representation that such shareholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such business before the meeting. -2-
No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of shareholders except business brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.D; provided, however, that, once business has been properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with such procedures, nothing in Section 2.D. shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any shareholder of any such business. If the Chairman of an annual meeting determines that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the Chairman shall declare to the meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting and such business shall not be transacted. SECTION 3. QUORUM. The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of shares representing a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at a meeting shall constitute a quorum. The shareholders present in person or by proxy at a duly organized meeting may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum. If a quorum not be present or represented at any meeting, the Chairman of the meeting or a majority of the shareholders present in person, or by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting without notice until the required voting shares shall be represented. At such adjourned meeting with the requisite amount of voting shares represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. SECTION 4. NOTICE OF MEETINGS. A written notice of each annual or special meeting of the shareholders of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board or the President or the Secretary, which shall state the time, place and purpose of such meeting, shall be delivered personally or mailed, not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days before the date of any such meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, the notice shall be directed to the shareholder at his address as it appears on the records of the stock transfer agent. Any shareholder, in person or by proxy, may at any time by a duly signed statement in writing to that effect, waive any statutory or other notice of any meeting, whether such statement be signed before or after such meeting. SECTION 5. VOTING. At all meetings of the shareholders, each holder of common stock having the right to vote, and present at the meeting in person or by proxy, shall be entitled to one vote for each full share of common stock of the Company entitled to vote and registered in his name.

Whenever any action is to be taken by vote of the shareholders, it shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of the shareholders by the holders of shares entitled to vote, unless a greater plurality is required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation. SECTION 6. PROXIES. Any shareholder of record entitled to vote may be represented at any annual or special meeting of the shareholders by a duly appointed proxy.

chairman of the meeting at all meetings of the shareholders. The Secretary, or in his absence one of the Assistant Secretaries, shall act as secretary of the meeting.

SECTION 8. ORDER OF BUSINESS. The order of business at all meetings of the shareholders shall be as determined by the Chairman of the meeting, but the order of business to be followed at any meeting at which a quorum is present may be changed by a vote of the shareholders. SECTION 9. RECORD DATE FOR ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT. In order that the Corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in New Jersey, its principal place of business or to any officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.

Nothing in this Article II, Section 9 shall require the Board of Directors to take any action with respect to any proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought other than to fix a record date as provided for herein; and the fixing of any such record date shall not be deemed to be an action taken by the Board of Directors with respect to any such proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought for any other purpose. SECTION 10. INSPECTORS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by Article II, Section 9, to the Company of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Company shall engage nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such -4-
date as the independent inspectors certify to the Company that the consents delivered to the Company in accordance with Article II, Section 9 represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any shareholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation). SECTION 11. EFFECTIVENESS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each shareholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with Article II, Section 9, a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to the Company in the manner prescribed in Article II, Section 9.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure. On February 9, 2005, Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD"), entered into a pre-arranged trading plan (the "Plan") established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and BD's policies with respect to stock transactions. Pursuant to the Plan, Mr. Ludwig intends to exercise options for 180,000 shares, and to sell 171,000 of the shares acquired upon exercise, over a nine-month period beginning in March 2005. The shares will be sold on the open market at prevailing market prices, subject to a minimum price threshold. The Plan follows the completion of a prior trading plan reported on May 27, 2004, and is part of Mr. Ludwig's long-term financial strategy for prudent asset diversification and liquidity. The options covered by the Plan were granted in January 1997 and were scheduled to expire in January 2007. These options represent approximately 18% of the vested options and 13.5% of the total options held by Mr. Ludwig. Excluding the options covered by the Plan, Mr. Ludwig holds additional options to acquire 1,152,964 BD shares. Mr. Ludwig currently beneficially owns approximately 126,680 shares of BD (excluding shares that may be acquired under stock options or performance-based awards). Mr. Ludwig's share holdings exceed the target ownership level for the CEO under BD's share retention and ownership guidelines of shares having a value of at least five times salary. Rule 10b5-1 allows persons who are not aware of material, non-public information to adopt written, pre-arranged trading plans. Individuals may use these plans to diversify their investment portfolios over time. Mr. Ludwig, as well as other BD officers and directors, may adopt similar plans in the future. BD does not undertake to report Rule 10b5-1 plans that may be adopted by any officers or directors of BD in the future, or to report any modifications or termination of any publicly announced plan, except to the extent required by law.

ITEM 2.02
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
On April 27, 2005, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the second fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2005. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted principles (GAAP), as follows:
        BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
        Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on the Company's net income, net income per share, or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.
        BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.

BD ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR SECOND FISCAL QUARTER
Franklin Lakes, NJ (April 27, 2005)
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported record quarterly revenues of $1.366 billion for the second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2005, representing an increase of 9 percent over the prior year period. This quarter's growth rate includes an estimated 3 percent benefit from foreign currency translation. Revenue growth in all segments benefited from foreign currency translation, particularly with respect to the Euro.
Reported diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were 72 cents, which reflected diluted earnings per share of 71 cents from continuing operations and 1 cent per share from discontinued operations. Reported diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 were 62 cents, which included less than 1 cent per share from discontinued operations. The results of operations from Clontech, a unit of the BD Biosciences segment, have been classified as "discontinued operations" as a result of the October 4, 2004 announcement of BD's intention to sell Clontech.
 
"We're pleased with our second quarter performance, which reflected revenue growth across all three segments and every global business unit of the Company. The combination of top-line results and continued improvement in operating efficiency resulted in double-digit earnings growth and strong cash flow," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our strong performance enables us to deliver on the commitment we have made to our shareholders to continue to make the additional investments necessary to fuel future innovation."
For the six-month period ended March 31, 2005, reported revenues were $2.654 billion, representing a 9 percent increase from the same period a year ago, including an estimated 3 percent benefit from foreign currency translation. Reported diluted earnings per share for the six-month period ended March 31, 2005 were $1.46, which reflected diluted earnings per share of $1.45 from continuing operations and 1 cent per share from discontinued operations. For the same period in fiscal 2004, reported diluted earnings per share were $1.10 and included income of 1 cent per share from discontinued operations. However, due to rounding, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.10.
 
 
Analyses of Second Quarter and Six-month Period of Fiscal Year 2005 and 2004 Earnings
The following analyses of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter and six-month period of fiscal 2005 and 2004 exclude specified items that affect the comparability of results between periods.
 
 
Based on the foregoing analyses, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, of 75 cents for the second fiscal quarter of 2005 increased by 21 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 62 cents for the second fiscal quarter of 2004. For the six-month period, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, of $1.46 for fiscal 2005 increased by 22 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, of $1.20 for fiscal 2004.
Share-Based Compensation
Effective October 1, 2004, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 123 (revised) relating to the expensing of share-based incentive awards. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter and six-month period included 5 cents and 8 cents, respectively, of share-based compensation expense associated with the adoption of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised), and the equity-based awards granted under the Company's new long-term incentive program. This program consists of a mix of performance-based restricted stock unit awards, time-vested restricted stock unit awards and stock options or stock appreciation rights. We estimate that total share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2005 will be about 17 cents per diluted share.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $732 million, representing an increase of 7 percent from the prior year period. U.S. sales of safety-engineered products totaled $115 million compared with $110 million in the prior year's quarter. The growth rate of U.S. safety-engineered products for the three months ended March 31, 2005 was adversely impacted by a major U.S. distributor reducing its inventory levels. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2005, U.S. sales of safety-engineered products totaled $241 million compared with $224 million in the prior year's period. Included in BD Medical revenues were international sales of
 
safety-engineered products of $21 million, compared with $17 million in the prior year's quarter. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2005, international sales of safety-engineered products totaled $39 million compared with $31 million in the prior year's period. Also contributing to the growth of the segment were strong sales in the Diabetes Care unit and the international portion of the Pharmaceutical Systems unit. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2005, the BD Medical segment reported 9 percent revenue growth.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $430 million, representing an increase of 12 percent from the prior year period. The Preanalytical Systems unit of the segment reported revenue growth of 5 percent. U.S. sales of safety-engineered products totaled $79 million compared with $75 million in the prior year's quarter. The growth rate of U.S. safety-engineered products for the three months ended March 31, 2005 was adversely impacted by a major U.S. distributor reducing its inventory levels. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2005, U.S. sales of safety-engineered products totaled $165 million compared with $151 million in the prior year's period. Included in Preanalytical Systems revenues were international sales of safety-engineered products of $47 million, compared with $34 million in the prior year's quarter. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2005, international sales of safety-engineered products totaled $91 million compared with $64 million in the prior year's period. Revenues in the Diagnostic Systems unit of the segment increased 20 percent based, primarily, on exceptionally strong sales in the quarter of flu diagnostic tests in Japan. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2005, the BD Diagnostics segment reported 8 percent revenue growth.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues from continuing operations for the quarter were $204 million, representing an increase of 8 percent from the prior year period. Instrument revenue growth continued to be the primary growth contributor, driven by sales of the BD FACSCanto and
 
the BD LSR II flow cytometers. Also contributing to the growth of the segment were increased sales in the Discovery Labware unit. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2005, the BD Biosciences segment reported 11 percent revenue growth, representing continued strong sales of flow cytometry instruments and reagents.
Geographic Results
Second quarter revenues in the U.S. of $630 million represented an increase of 3 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside the U.S. of $736 million represented an increase of 14 percent over the prior year period, including an estimated 5 percent benefit from foreign currency translation.
For the six-month period ended March 31, 2005, revenues in the U.S. of $1.254 billion represented an increase of 5 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. of $1.40 billion represented an increase of 13 percent over the prior year period, including an estimated 5 percent benefit from foreign currency translation.
Fiscal 2005 Outlook for Third and Fourth Quarters and Full Year
The following analyses of estimated diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the third and fourth fiscal quarters and full year exclude specified items that affect the comparability of results between periods.

The complaint, which is similar to the complaint filed in March 2005 against BD in Federal Court in Newark, New Jersey by Louisiana Wholesale Drug Company, alleges that BD violated federal and various state antitrust laws, resulting in the charging of higher prices for certain BD products to plaintiff and other proposed class members. Unlike the Louisiana Wholesale Drug complaint, which is brought on behalf of direct purchasers such as distributors, this new complaint is brought on behalf of indirect purchasers of BD products. BD believes that the plaintiffs' allegations in this lawsuit are without merit and intends to defend against them vigorously.

ITEM 2.02
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
On July 22, 2005, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the third fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2005. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted principles (GAAP), as follows:
We also separately present gross profit and gross profit margin after excluding the impact of significant charges. Management believes that these adjusted measures of gross profit and gross profit margin are more indicative of BD's underlying performance, and also allow investors to better understand BD's comparative operating performance for the period presented.
We also separately present these measures after excluding the impact of significant charges. Management believes that these adjusted measures of operating income are more indicative of BD's underlying performance, and also allow investors to better understand BD's comparative operating performance for the period presented.
 
 
 
compensation expense for the period, (ii) the effects of significant reversals of tax reserves, and (iii) the effects of changes in tax laws and regulations (including without limitation, rate changes) and other events that cause the tax rate for the period being presented to vary from BD's expected effective tax rate for the full year. Management eliminates the effect of share-based compensation in these instances in order to improve comparability to prior periods in which such expense was not recognized. In addition, significant reversals of tax reserves and the items mentioned above that effect our periodic effective tax rate cause fluctuations in BD's operating income from continuing operations from period to period that management believes are unrelated to BD's underlying operating performance. Accordingly, management believes that providing the impact of such effects allows investors to better understand BD's comparative operating performance for the period presented.
We also present earnings per share after excluding (i) the impact of share-based compensation expense for the period, (ii) the effects of significant reversals of tax reserves, and (iii) the effects of changes in tax laws and regulations and other events that cause the tax rate for the period being presented to vary from BD's expected effective tax rate for the full year. Management eliminates the effect of share-based compensation in these instances in order to improve comparability to prior periods in which such expense was not recognized. In addition, significant reversals of tax reserves and the items mentioned above that effect our periodic effective tax rate cause fluctuations in BD's operating income from continuing operations from period to period that management believes are unrelated to BD's underlying operating performance. Accordingly, management believes that providing the impact of such effects allows investors to better understand BD's comparative operating performance for the period presented.
 
 
 
 
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.

BD ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR THIRD FISCAL QUARTER
 
Franklin Lakes, NJ (July 22, 2005)
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported record quarterly revenues of $1.381 billion for the third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2005, representing an increase of 11 percent over the prior year period. This quarter's growth rate includes an estimated 3 percent benefit from foreign currency translation. Revenue growth in all segments benefited from foreign currency translation, driven by favorable exchange rates in Europe, Asia Pacific, South Latin America, Canada, and Japan.
 
Reported diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were 73 cents, which included less than 1 cent per share from discontinued operations. Reported diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 were 41 cents, which included less than 1 cent per share from discontinued operations; however, due to rounding, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 42 cents. Included in the prior period results was a pre-tax charge of $100 million related to a litigation settlement in July 2004. This charge reduced net income by $63 million and reported diluted earnings per share by 24 cents. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding this specified item would have been 66 cents.
 
The results of operations from Clontech, a unit of the BD Biosciences segment, have been classified as "discontinued operations." As previously announced, on July 1, 2005, BD signed an agreement to sell Clontech to Takara Bio Inc. of Otsu, Japan.
 
"I'm very pleased that we delivered another strong quarter," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our performance reflects revenue growth across all three segments, and in particular in the Diabetes Care, Pharmaceutical Systems, Preanalytical Systems and Discovery Labware units."
 
For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2005, reported revenues were $4.035 billion, representing a 10 percent increase from the prior year period, including an estimated 3 percent benefit from foreign currency translation. Reported diluted earnings per share for the nine-month period ended June 30, 2005 were $2.19, which reflected diluted earnings per share of $2.18 from continuing operations and 1 cent per share from discontinued operations. For the same period in fiscal 2004, reported diluted earnings per share were $1.51, which included less than 1 cent per share from discontinued operations.
 
 
 
 
Analyses of Third Quarter and Nine-month Period of Fiscal Year 2005 and 2004 Earnings
The following analyses of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter and nine-month period of fiscal 2005 and 2004 exclude specified items and share-based compensation expense that affect the comparability of results between periods.
 
(1)
Included in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the nine-month period ended June 30, 2005 is a benefit of approximately 4 cents per diluted share due to the reversal of tax reserves in connection with the conclusion of tax examinations in four non-U.S. jurisdictions that occurred in the first quarter.
(2)
Represents the effect on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of tax-related events that caused the tax rate to vary from the expected effective tax rate for the year. The effective tax rate for the year, without taking into account the tax impact of the items described in notes (1) and (5) herein, is expected to be 25.5%.
(3)
Included in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2004 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is a first quarter charge of 11 cents per diluted share related to the voluntary recall and write-off of certain blood glucose strip inventory and other actions taken with respect to our blood glucose monitoring products.
(4)
Included in fiscal 2004 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is a third quarter charge of 24 cents per diluted share related to a litigation settlement.
(5)
Represents the effect on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations relating to share-based compensation expense associated with the early adoption of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised), and the equity-based awards granted under BD's new long-term incentive program, as described below.
 
Based on the foregoing analyses, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items and share-based compensation expense, of 78 cents for the third fiscal quarter of 2005 increased by 18 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, of 66 cents for the third fiscal quarter of 2004. For the nine-month period, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items and share-based compensation expense, of $2.24 for fiscal 2005 increased by 20 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, of $1.86 for fiscal 2004.
 
 
 
 
Share-Based Compensation
Effective October 1, 2004, BD adopted FASB Statement No. 123 (revised) relating to the expensing of share-based incentive awards. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter and nine-month period included 5 cents and 12 cents, respectively, of share-based compensation expense associated with the adoption of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised), and the equity-based awards granted under BD's new long-term incentive program. This program consists of a mix of performance-based restricted stock unit awards, time-vested restricted stock unit awards and stock options or stock appreciation rights.
 
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $770 million, representing an increase of 13 percent from the prior year period. Contributing to the growth of the segment were strong sales in the Diabetes Care and Pharmaceutical Systems units. U.S. sales of safety-engineered products totaled $119 million compared with $113 million in the prior year's quarter.

Fiscal 2005 Outlook for Fourth Quarter and Full Year
 
The following analyses of estimated diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth fiscal quarter and full year exclude specified items and share-based compensation expense that affect the comparability of results between periods.
 
(1)
Fiscal 2005 fourth quarter and full year estimated diluted earnings per share from continuing operations do not include the impact on taxes that would result if, as currently anticipated, the Company were to determine that it would repatriate certain undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
(2)
Represents the effect on estimated diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of the reversal of tax reserves in the first fiscal quarter in connection with the conclusion of tax examinations in four non-U.S. jurisdictions.
(3)
Represents the effect on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of tax-related events that caused the tax rate to vary from the expected effective tax rate for the year. The effective tax rate for the year, without taking into account the tax impact of the items described in notes (1), (2) and (5) herein, is expected to be 25.5%.
(4)
Included in fiscal 2004 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are the previously noted first quarter BGM charge of 11 cents per diluted share and the third quarter litigation charge of 24 cents per diluted share.
(5)
Represents the effect on estimated diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of share-based compensation expense associated with the early adoption of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised),
and the equity-based awards granted under the new long-term incentive program, including an estimated fourth quarter adjustment associated with a projected increase in the estimated payout of performance-based restricted stock unit awards.
 
 
 
 
The Company estimates that fourth fiscal quarter 2005 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items and share-based compensation expense, will increase in the range of 6 to 9 percent over fourth fiscal quarter 2004 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 70 cents.
 
The Company also estimates that diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2005, excluding specified items and share-based compensation expense, will increase in the range of 16 to 17 percent over fiscal 2004 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, of $2.56.

The registered office of Becton, Dickinson and Company ("Company") shall be in the Borough of Franklin Lakes, County of Bergen, State of New Jersey or such other place within or without the State of New Jersey as the Board of Directors may designate. The Company may also establish and have such other offices within or without the State of New Jersey, as the Board of Directors may designate or its business may require.
ARTICLE II
Meetings of Shareholders
SECTION 1.      PLACE OF MEETINGS. Meetings of the shareholders shall be held at the registered office of the Company in New Jersey, or at such other place, within or without the State of New Jersey, as may be designated by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting.
SECTION 2.A.  ANNUAL MEETINGS. The annual meeting of shareholders for the election of directors and the transaction of such other business as may be related to the purposes set forth in the notice of the meeting shall be held at such time as may be fixed by the Board of Directors.
B.         SPECIAL MEETING FOR ELECTION OF DIRECTORS. If the annual meeting of shareholders is not held on the date designated, the Board of Directors may call a special meeting of the shareholders for the election of directors and the transaction of other business.
C.         SPECIAL MEETINGS. Special meetings of the shareholders may be called by the Board of Directors or by the Chairman of the Board or by the President, and shall be called by the Chairman of the Board or by the President upon written request of a majority of the Directors then in office, which request shall state the time, place and purpose of the meeting.
D.         ADVANCE NOTICE OF NOMINATIONS AND BUSINESS TO BE TRANSACTED AT ANNUAL MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS. No business may be transacted at an annual meeting of shareholders, other than business that is either (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof), (b) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or (c) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by any shareholder of the Company (i) who is a shareholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 2.D. and on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote at such annual meeting and (ii) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.D.
 
 
 
 
In addition to any other applicable requirements, for nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors or for other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder, such shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the Company.
To be timely, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Company not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders;
provided
however
, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for on a date that is not within 30 days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder in order to be timely must be so received not earlier than the 120
th
day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90
th
day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of shareholder's notice as described above.
Notwithstanding anything in the first sentence of the preceding paragraph to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors is increased and there is no notice or public disclosure by the Company naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least 70 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 2.D. shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made.
To be in proper written form, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must set forth (a) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and Rule 14a-11 thereunder (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected), (b) as to each matter such shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (c) the name and record address of such shareholder, (d) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Company that are owned beneficially or of record by such shareholder, (e) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such shareholder and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with such nomination or proposal of such business by such shareholder and any material interest of such shareholder in such business and (f) a representation that such shareholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such business before the meeting.
 
 
 
 
 
No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of shareholders except business brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.D;
provided
,
however
, that, once business has been properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with such procedures, nothing in Section 2.D. shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any shareholder of any such business. If the Chairman of an annual meeting determines that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the Chairman shall declare to the meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting and such business shall not be transacted.
SECTION 3.      QUORUM. The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of shares representing a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at a meeting shall constitute a quorum. The shareholders present in person or by proxy at a duly organized meeting may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum. If a quorum not be present or represented at any meeting, the Chairman of the meeting or a majority of the shareholders present in person, or by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting without notice until the required voting shares shall be represented. At such adjourned meeting with the requisite amount of voting shares represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.
SECTION 4.      NOTICE OF MEETINGS. A written notice of each annual or special meeting of the shareholders of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board or the President or the Secretary, which shall state the time, place and purpose of such meeting, shall be delivered personally or mailed, not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days before the date of any such meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, the notice shall be directed to the shareholder at his address as it appears on the records of the stock transfer agent. Any shareholder, in person or by proxy, may at any time by a duly signed statement in writing to that effect, waive any statutory or other notice of any meeting, whether such statement be signed before or after such meeting.
SECTION 5.       VOTING. At all meetings of the shareholders, each holder of common stock having the right to vote, and present at the meeting in person or by proxy, shall be entitled to one vote for each full share of common stock of the Company entitled to vote and registered in his name. Each holder of preferred stock of any series shall have such voting powers, if any, as the Board of Directors shall have fixed by resolution prior to the issuance of any shares of such series. Whenever any action is to be taken by vote of the shareholders, it shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of the shareholders by the holders of shares entitled to vote, unless a greater plurality is required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation.
SECTION 6.      PROXIES. Any shareholder of record entitled to vote may be represented at any annual or special meeting of the shareholders by a duly appointed proxy. All proxies shall be written and properly signed, but shall require no other attestation, and shall be filed with the Secretary of the meeting before being voted.
SECTION 7.      ORGANIZATION. The Chairman of the Board, or in the absence of the Chairman of the Board, the Vice Chairman or the President, shall act as
 
 
 
chairman of the meeting at all meetings of the shareholders. The Secretary, or in his absence one of the Assistant Secretaries, shall act as secretary of the meeting. In case none of the officers above designated to act as Chairman or Secretary of the meeting shall be present, a chairman or a secretary of the meeting, as the case may be, shall be chosen by a vote of the shareholders.
SECTION 8.      ORDER OF BUSINESS. The order of business at all meetings of the shareholders shall be as determined by the Chairman of the meeting, but the order of business to be followed at any meeting at which a quorum is present may be changed by a vote of the shareholders.
SECTION 9.      RECORD DATE FOR ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT. In order that the Corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in New Jersey, its principal place of business or to any officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action. Nothing in this Article II, Section 9 shall require the Board of Directors to take any action with respect to any proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought other than to fix a record date as provided for herein; and the fixing of any such record date shall not be deemed to be an action taken by the Board of Directors with respect to any such proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought for any other purpose.
SECTION 10. INSPECTORS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by Article II, Section 9, to the Company of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Company shall engage nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such
 
 
 
date as the independent inspectors certify to the Company that the consents delivered to the Company in accordance with Article II, Section 9 represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any shareholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
SECTION 11. EFFECTIVENESS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each shareholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with Article II, Section 9, a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to the Company in the manner prescribed in Article II, Section 9.
 
ARTICLE III
Directors

Regular meetings, without notice, may be held at such time and place as the Board of Directors may designate. The Chairman of the Board or the President may call any special meeting of the Board of Directors, and shall do so whenever
 
 
 
requested in writing by at least one-third of the Directors. Notice of each special meeting shall be mailed to each director at least four days before the date on which the meeting is to be held, or be telephoned or sent to each Director by telegraph, telex, TWX, cable, wireless or similar means of communication, or be delivered in person, not later than the day before the date on which such meeting is to be held. The Board of Directors may meet to transact business at any time and place without notice, provided that each director shall be present, or that any Director or Directors not present shall waive notice in writing, either before or after such meeting. The attendance of any Director at a meeting without protesting prior to the conclusion of the meeting the lack of notice of such meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice by him. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting. Notice of an adjourned meeting need not be given if the time and place are fixed at the meeting adjourning and if the period of adjournment does not exceed 10 days in any one adjournment.

SECTION 7.      ACTION WITHOUT A MEETING. The Board of Directors may act without a meeting if, prior or subsequent to such action, each Director shall consent in writing to such action. Such written consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board of Directors.

The Board may, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Directors then in office, fix reasonable fees or compensation of the Directors for services to the Company, including attendance at meetings of the Board of Directors or Committees of the Board. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to preclude any Director from serving the Company in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. Each Director shall be entitled to receive reimbursement for reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of his duties.
ARTICLE IV

OTHER EVENTS.
     On August 31, 2005, Daniels Sharpsmart, an Illinois company, filed suit against Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD"), another manufacturer and three group purchasing organizations in the United States District Court in Texarkana, Texas (505CV169). The plaintiff alleges, among other things, that BD and the other defendants conspired to exclude the plaintiff from the sharps-collection market by entering into long-term contracts in violation of federal and state antitrust laws. The plaintiff seeks money damages in an as yet undisclosed amount.
     On September 6, 2005, SAJ Distributors, Inc., an Arkansas company, filed a purported class action lawsuit against BD in the United States District Court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (2:05-CV-04763-JD). The complaint alleges that BD violated federal antitrust laws, resulting in the charging of higher prices for certain BD products to plaintiff and other purported class members. This complaint is similar to the complaint filed in March 2005 against BD in Federal Court in Newark, New Jersey by Louisiana Wholesale Drug Company, in that it is brought on behalf of direct purchasers such as distributors. The plaintiff seeks money damages in an as yet undisclosed amount.
     BD believes it has meritorious defenses to these claims and intends to defend these lawsuits vigorously.

ITEM 2.02
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
On November 3, 2005, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted principles (GAAP), as follows:
 
 
 
 
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
ITEM 8.01
OTHER EVENTS.
          On September 12, 2005, Dik Drug Company filed a purported class action lawsuit against BD in the United States District Court in Newark, New Jersey (2:05-cv-04465-JLL-RJH). On October 3, 2005, American Sales Company, Inc. filed a purported class action against BD in the United States District Court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (2:05-cv-05212-CMR). On October 26, 2005, Park Surgical Co. Inc., a New York corporation, filed a purported class action lawsuit against BD in the United States District Court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (2:05-cv-05678-CMR).
 The complaints allege that BD violated federal antitrust laws, resulting in the charging of higher prices for certain BD products to plaintiffs and other purported class members. These complaints are similar to the previously reported complaints filed in March 2005 against BD in the United States District Court in Newark, New Jersey by Louisiana Wholesale Drug Company, and in September 2005 against BD in the United States District Court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by SAJ Distributors, Inc., in that they are brought on behalf of direct purchasers such as distributors. The plaintiffs seek money damages in as yet undisclosed amounts.
 
          The actions brought by Louisiana Wholesale Drug Company and Dik Drug Company in New Jersey have been consolidated and are now captioned "In re Hypodermic Products Antitrust Litigation." In addition, BD has made a motion before the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to transfer the actions brought by Louisiana Wholesale Drug Company, Dik Drug Company, American Sales Company, Inc., and SAJ Distributors, Inc., along with the previously reported action brought by Jabo's Pharmacy, Inc. against BD in the United States District Court in Greeneville, Tennessee, for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings. BD expects that the action brought by Park Surgical Co. Inc. will be added to BD's motion to the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation in the near future.
 
          BD believes it has meritorious defenses to these claims and intends to defend these lawsuits vigorously.

BD ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER AND FULL YEAR
 
 
 
 
Franklin Lakes, NJ (November 3, 2005)
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported quarterly revenues of $1.379 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2005, representing an increase of 10 percent over the prior year period. This quarter's growth rate includes an estimated 2 percent benefit from foreign currency translation. Revenue growth in all segments benefited from foreign currency translation, driven primarily by favorable exchange rates in Latin America, Asia Pacific, and Canada.
 
"Our excellent results this year were driven, in particular, by our strong international performance, new product revenue growth, and significant margin improvement," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our Asia Pacific/Japan, Canada, Europe, and Latin American regions contributed double-digit revenue growth and the combination of higher margin products and increased operating effectiveness drove margin expansion. Performance such as this will allow us to continue to increase the pace of our R&D spending while also targeting double-digit earnings growth."
 
"Our strong fourth quarter provides a solid foundation for fiscal 2006," added Mr. Ludwig. "We feel confident in our expectation that earnings will grow by approximately 10 percent. On a performance basis, this equates to about 14 percent, excluding the expected negative impact of foreign currency translation."
 
 
 
 
Analyses of Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2005 and 2004 Earnings
The following analyses of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2005 and 2004 identify specified items and share-based compensation expense that affect comparability of results between periods.
 
Included in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 is a benefit of approximately 4 cents per diluted share due to the reversal of tax reserves in connection with the conclusion of tax examinations in four non-U.S. jurisdictions that occurred in the first quarter.
(1)
Represents the effect on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of tax-related events that caused the tax rate to vary from the expected effective tax rate for the year. The effective tax rate for the year, without taking into account the tax impact of the items described in notes (1), (3) and (6) herein, is 25.5%.
(2)
Included in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 is 27 cents per diluted share substantially related to the impact on taxes of the planned repatriation of $1.3 billion of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act.
(3)
Included in fiscal 2004 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is a first quarter charge of 11 cents per diluted share related to the voluntary recall and write-off of certain blood glucose strip inventory and other actions taken with respect to our blood glucose monitoring products.
(4)
Included in fiscal 2004 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is a third quarter charge of 24 cents per diluted share related to a litigation settlement.
(5)
Represents the effect on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations relating to share-based compensation expense in accordance with the first quarter adoption of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised), "Share-Based Payment."
(6)
 
Based on the foregoing analyses, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2005, excluding specified items and share-based compensation expense, of 83 cents increased by 19 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 70 cents for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004. For the year, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items and share-based compensation expense, of $3.07 increased by 20 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, of $2.56 for fiscal 2004.
 
 
 
 
 
Reported diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 were 58 cents, including a 27 cents per diluted share tax charge that relates substantially to the Company's planned repatriation of $1.3 billion of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act, and a gain of 11 cents per diluted share from discontinued operations resulting from the sale of Clontech on August 31, 2005.
 
Reported diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 were 26 cents, reflecting a loss of 44 cents per share from discontinued operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 70 cents.
 
For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, reported revenues were $5.415 billion, representing a 10 percent increase from the prior year, including an estimated 3 percent benefit from foreign currency translation, which was based on favorable exchange rates in all regions. Reported diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 were $2.77, including the previously noted fourth quarter tax charge of 27 cents per share and a gain of 11 cents per share from discontinued operations resulting from the sale of Clontech.
 
For fiscal year 2004, reported diluted earnings per share were $1.77, which reflected diluted earnings per share of $2.21 from continuing operations, and a loss of 44 cents per share from discontinued operations. Included in the results of continuing operations for the year were a first quarter charge of 11 cents per share related to our blood glucose monitoring products and a third quarter charge of 24 cents per share related to a litigation settlement.

To be timely, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Company not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders;

In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of shareholder's notice as described above.

No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of shareholders except business brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.D;
provided
,
however
, that, once business has been properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with such procedures, nothing in Section 2.D. shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any shareholder of any such business. If the Chairman of an annual meeting determines that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the Chairman shall declare to the meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting and such business shall not be transacted.
SECTION 3.
        
QUORUM. The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of shares representing a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at a meeting shall constitute a quorum. The shareholders present in person or by proxy at a duly organized meeting may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum. If a quorum not be present or represented at any meeting, the Chairman of the meeting or a majority of the shareholders present in person, or by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting without notice until the required voting shares shall be represented.

Each holder of preferred stock of any series shall have such voting powers, if any, as the Board of Directors shall have fixed by resolution prior to the issuance of any shares of such series. Whenever any action is to be taken by vote of the shareholders, it shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of the shareholders by the holders of shares entitled to vote, unless a greater plurality is required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation.
SECTION 6.
        
PROXIES. Any shareholder of record entitled to vote may be represented at any annual or special meeting of the shareholders by a duly appointed proxy. All proxies shall be written and properly signed, but shall require no other attestation, and shall be filed with the Secretary of the meeting before being voted.

SECTION 8.
        
ORDER OF BUSINESS. The order of business at all meetings of the shareholders shall be as determined by the Chairman of the meeting, but the order of business to be followed at any meeting at which a quorum is present may be changed by a vote of the shareholders.
SECTION 9.
        
RECORD DATE FOR ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT. In order that the Corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in New Jersey, its principal place of business or to any officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action. Nothing in this Article II, Section 9 shall require the Board of Directors to take any action with respect to any proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought other than to fix a record date as provided for herein; and the fixing of any such record date shall not be deemed to be an action taken by the Board of Directors with respect to any such proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought for any other purpose.
SECTION 10. INSPECTORS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by Article II, Section 9, to the Company of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Company shall engage nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such
 
 
 
date as the independent inspectors certify to the Company that the consents delivered to the Company in accordance with Article II, Section 9 represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action.

This authorization is in addition to the approximately 4.3 million shares that remained available at September 30, 2005 under a 10 million-share repurchase authorization in November 2004. On September 30, 2005, BD had approximately 248 million common shares outstanding. BD said the new authorization is consistent with continued strong cash flow.
 
"BD has increased its dividend for 33 consecutive years. Our dividend, along with the repurchasing of our shares, has allowed us to return significant dollars to our shareholders," said Edward J. Ludwig, BD Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "This provides evidence that our strategy of driving revenue growth through innovation and expanding margins by improving operational effectiveness is working. We will continue to implement it, and we expect our shareholders to continue to be the beneficiaries."

 In conjunction with the filing of its annual proxy statement today, BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE:BDX) announced that its shareholder rights plan, commonly known as a "poison pill," will not be renewed upon its expiration in April 2006.

"This approach to director elections further strengthens BD's long-standing commitment to good corporate governance practices," stated Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our Board of Directors continues to demonstrate outstanding responsiveness and dedication to shareholder interests in this important area."

BD Announces Agreement to Acquire GeneOhm Sciences, Inc.
 
Franklin Lakes, NJ (January 10, 2006)
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE:BDX) announced today that it has signed an agreement to acquire GeneOhm Sciences, Inc., a privately held company headquartered in San Diego, California that has pioneered the development of molecular diagnostic testing for the rapid detection of bacterial organisms, including those known to cause healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). GeneOhm Sciences had 2005 revenues of approximately $5 million and provides BD with expanded entry into the emerging HAI market. Today, nearly 6 million HAIs occur annually across the U.S., Europe and Japan, and are implicated in up to an estimated 90,000 deaths per year in the U.S. alone. Many publications have suggested that the use of active surveillance and associated diagnostics could substantially reduce the prevalence of HAIs.
1
 
BD has agreed to pay $230 million, plus up to $25 million in additional incentives, for the company. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close by the end of March 2006. The transaction is slightly dilutive; however, BD reaffirms its previous guidance that reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2006 are expected to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.19. BD will provide further details around this guidance during its first quarter earnings call on January 26, 2006.
 
GeneOhm Sciences is developing nucleic acid-based assay systems providing rapid results to help transform patient care. Its IDI-MRSA and IDI-Strep B tests are FDA cleared and provide an innovative, extremely accurate, and rapid format for these critical tests. MRSA (methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus
) is a "super bug" known to cause HAIs, and Group B Strep is a health threat to pregnant women and their children during the latter stages of pregnancy.
 
"A key element of BD's strategy is driving revenue growth through innovation," stated Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of BD. "This transaction aligns innovative new technologies with BD's existing business strategies and is a natural complement to our core strengths and leadership position in clinical microbiology."

"This agreement represents a significant step forward in BD Diagnostics' strategy to play a leading role in the evolution of molecular diagnostics, and it positions us to become a leader in the prevention of healthcare-associated infections," said William A. Kozy, President, BD Diagnostics. "We believe the molecular opportunities for microbiology will grow at attractive rates for the foreseeable future."

ITEM 2.02
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
On January 26, 2006, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the first fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2006. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
Additional Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures
 
Below are reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures used in the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 to the comparable GAAP measure:
 
The foregoing does not reflect any in-process R&D charge that may be recorded in connection with the anticipated acquisition of GeneOhm Sciences, Inc., as discussed in the press release.
 
 
This Current Report on Form 8-K and the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contain certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted principles (GAAP), as follows:
We also present income taxes and effective tax rate for the prior year's period after excluding the effects of significant reversals of tax reserves and the effects of changes in tax laws and regulations and other events that caused the tax rate for the quarter to vary from BD's then expected effective tax rate for the full year. Management provides these adjusted measures of income taxes and effective tax rate in order to facilitate comparisons to other periods.
We also present earnings per share from continuing operations on a prospective basis after excluding the expected dilutive impact from the anticipated acquisition of GeneOhm Sciences Inc. Management excludes this impact in order to improve the comparability of the period or periods being presented to prior periods where such impact was not recorded.
We also present earnings per share from continuing operations for prior periods after excluding (i) the effects of significant reversals of tax reserves, (ii) the effects of changes in tax laws and regulations and other events that caused the tax rate during the period to vary from BD's expected effective tax rate for the full year, and/or (iii) the impact on taxes of the planned repatriation of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. Significant reversals of tax reserves and the items mentioned above that effect our periodic effective tax rate cause fluctuations in BD's income from continuing operations from period to period that management believes are unrelated to BD's underlying operating performance. Accordingly, management believes that providing the impact of such effects allows investors to better understand BD's
 
 
comparative operating performance for the periods presented. In addition, management eliminates the effect of the repatriation of foreign earnings in order to improve comparability to other periods in which such expense was not recognized.
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability

BD ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR FIRST FISCAL QUARTER
 
Franklin Lakes, NJ (January 26, 2006)
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported record quarterly revenues of $1.414 billion for the first fiscal quarter ended
December 31, 2005, representing an increase of 10 percent over the prior year period. This quarter's growth rate reflects an overall estimated 1 percent unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, which affected all segments.
 
"Our strong performance this quarter, and over the last five years, demonstrates that our strategy to drive growth through innovation, expand our margins by improving operating effectiveness and generate strong cash flow is working," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "This strong performance enables us to continue to return value to shareholders and provides us the capacity to invest for the future. We are doing this primarily by increasing the pace of R&D spending and, as appropriate, through strategic investments, such as our recent agreement to acquire GeneOhm Sciences to drive our molecular diagnostics strategy."
 
Analysis of First Quarter Fiscal Year 2006 and 2005 Earnings
The following analysis of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and 2005 identifies specified items that affect comparability of results between periods.
 
 
 
 
- more -
 
 
 
 
 
Represents the effect on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of proceeds from insurance settlement concluded in the first fiscal quarter 2006.
(1)
Represents the effect on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of the reversal of tax reserves in connection with the conclusion of tax examinations in four non-U.S. jurisdictions.
(2)
Represents the effect on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of tax-related events that caused the first fiscal quarter 2005 tax rate to vary from the then expected effective tax rate for fiscal 2005.
(3)
 
Based on the foregoing analysis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, for the first fiscal quarter of 2006 of 83 cents increased by 22 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, of 68 cents for the first fiscal quarter of 2005.
 
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $771 million, representing an increase of 11 percent over the prior year period. Strong sales in the Pharmaceutical Systems and Diabetes Care units contributed to growth. U.S. sales of safety-engineered products totaled $132 million, compared with $126 million in the prior year's quarter. Included in BD Medical revenues were international sales of safety-engineered products of $22 million, compared with
$18 million in the prior year's quarter.
 
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $444 million, representing an increase of 7 percent over the prior year period. The Diagnostic Systems unit of the segment reported revenue growth of 8 percent, due primarily to strong sales of flu diagnostic tests, which totaled $27 million, compared with $18 million in the prior year's period. Solid sales growth from the BD ProbeTec and BD Phoenix instrument platforms also contributed to growth. The Preanalytical Systems unit of the segment reported revenue growth of 7 percent. U.S. sales of safety-engineered products totaled $96 million, compared with $86 million in the prior year's quarter. International sales of safety-engineered products totaled $52 million, compared with $42 million in the prior year's quarter.
 
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $200 million, representing an increase of 10 percent over the prior year period. Research instruments and reagent sales continued to be the primary growth contributors, driven by increased demand for both research analyzers and sorters.
 
 
 
 
Geographic Results
First quarter revenues in the U.S. were $681 million, representing an increase of 9 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside the U.S. were $733 million, representing an increase of 10 percent over the prior year period, and reflect an estimated 2 percent unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.
 
Planned Acquisition of GeneOhm Sciences, Inc.
On January 10, 2006 BD announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire GeneOhm Sciences, Inc. ("the acquisition"), a privately held company that has pioneered the development of molecular diagnostic testing for the rapid detection of bacterial organisms, including those known to cause healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close by the end of March 2006. As a result of the acquisition, the Company expects its diluted earnings per share from continuing operations would be reduced by an estimated 1 cent for the second quarter and 7 cents for the full fiscal year 2006 (see Table 2 below). In addition, the Company would reflect an in-process research and development charge, which would further reduce estimated diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by approximately 20 to 25 cents.
 
Fiscal 2006 Outlook for Full Year and Second Quarter  Refer to Table 2 Below
The Company estimates that diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items and the in-process research and development charge, and including the expected dilutive impact on operating results from the anticipated acquisition, will increase approximately 9-11 percent for the full fiscal year 2006 over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, of $2.88 for the fiscal year 2005.
 
The Company also estimates that diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items and the in-process research and development charge, and including the expected dilutive impact on operating results from the anticipated acquisition, will increase approximately 6-7 percent for the second fiscal quarter of 2006 over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 71 cents for the second fiscal quarter of 2005.
 
For the six-month period ending March 31, 2006, the Company estimates that diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items and the in-process research and development charge, and including the expected dilutive impact on operating results from the anticipated acquisition, will increase approximately 14-15 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, of $1.38 for the prior year period.
 
Consistent with our initial fiscal year guidance on November 3, 2005, second half fiscal year 2006 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the expected dilutive impact on operating results from the anticipated acquisition, are expected to increase approximately 9-11 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, of $1.50 for the prior year period.
 
The following analysis of estimated diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second fiscal quarter and full fiscal year identifies specified items that affect the comparability of results between periods.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Represents the effect on estimated diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of estimated proceeds from insurance settlements. Full fiscal year 2006 estimate of approximately 5 cents reflects a settlement of $7 million completed in the first quarter (2 cents per diluted earnings per share from continuing operations) and approximately $12 million (3 cents per diluted earnings per share from continuing operations) from settlements anticipated to be completed in the second quarter.
(1)
Represents the effect on estimated diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of the reversal of tax reserves in the first fiscal quarter of 2005 in connection with the conclusion of tax examinations in four non-U.S. jurisdictions.
(2)
Represents the effect on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of tax-related events that caused the quarterly tax rate to vary from the then expected effective tax rate for fiscal year 2005.
(3)
Does not include expected in-process research and development charge, resulting in an estimated impact of between 20 and 25 cents on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which would be recorded upon closing of the acquisition.
(4)
Included in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 is
(5)
27 cents per diluted share substantially related to the impact on taxes of the planned repatriation of $1.3 billion of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act.

RECORD DATE FOR ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT. In order that the Corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in New Jersey, its principal place of business or to any officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action. Nothing in this Article II, Section 9 shall require the Board of Directors to take any action with respect to any proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought other than to fix a record date as provided for herein; and the fixing of any such record date shall not be deemed to be an action taken by the Board of Directors with respect to any such proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought for any other purpose.
SECTION 10. INSPECTORS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by Article II, Section 9, to the Company of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Company shall engage nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such
 
 
 
date as the independent inspectors certify to the Company that the consents delivered to the Company in accordance with Article II, Section 9 represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any shareholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
SECTION 11. EFFECTIVENESS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each shareholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with Article II, Section 9, a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to the Company in the manner prescribed in Article II, Section 9.

In addition to any other applicable requirements, for nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors or for other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder, such shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the Company.
To be timely, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Company not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders;
provided
however
, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for on a date that is not within 30 days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder in order to be timely must be so received not earlier than the 120 day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90 day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of shareholder's notice as described above.
th
th
Notwithstanding anything in the first sentence of the preceding paragraph to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors is increased and there is no notice or public disclosure by the Company naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least 70 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 2.D. shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made.
To be in proper written form, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must set forth (a) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and Rule 14a-11 thereunder (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected), (b) as to each matter such shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (c) the name and record address of such shareholder, (d) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Company that are owned beneficially or of record by such shareholder, (e) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such shareholder and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with such nomination or proposal of such business by such shareholder and any material interest of such shareholder in such business and (f) a representation that such shareholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such business before the meeting.
 
 
 
 
 
No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of shareholders except business brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.D;
provided
,
however
, that, once business has been properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with such procedures, nothing in Section 2.D. shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any shareholder of any such business. If the Chairman of an annual meeting determines that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the Chairman shall declare to the meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting and such business shall not be transacted.
SECTION 3.
        
QUORUM. The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of shares representing a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at a meeting shall constitute a quorum. The shareholders present in person or by proxy at a duly organized meeting may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum. If a quorum not be present or represented at any meeting, the Chairman of the meeting or a majority of the shareholders present in person, or by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting without notice until the required voting shares shall be represented. At such adjourned meeting with the requisite amount of voting shares represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.
SECTION 4.

SECTION 5.
        
VOTING. At all meetings of the shareholders, each holder of common stock having the right to vote, and present at the meeting in person or by proxy, shall be entitled to one vote for each full share of common stock of the Company entitled to vote and registered in his name. Each holder of preferred stock of any series shall have such voting powers, if any, as the Board of Directors shall have fixed by resolution prior to the issuance of any shares of such series. Whenever any action is to be taken by vote of the shareholders, it shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of the shareholders by the holders of shares entitled to vote, unless a greater plurality is required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation.
SECTION 6.
        
PROXIES. Any shareholder of record entitled to vote may be represented at any annual or special meeting of the shareholders by a duly appointed proxy.

chairman of the meeting at all meetings of the shareholders. The Secretary, or in his absence one of the Assistant Secretaries, shall act as secretary of the meeting. In case none of the officers above designated to act as Chairman or Secretary of the meeting shall be present, a chairman or a secretary of the meeting, as the case may be, shall be chosen by a vote of the shareholders.
SECTION 8.
        
ORDER OF BUSINESS. The order of business at all meetings of the shareholders shall be as determined by the Chairman of the meeting, but the order of business to be followed at any meeting at which a quorum is present may be changed by a vote of the shareholders.
SECTION 9.
        
RECORD DATE FOR ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT. In order that the Corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in New Jersey, its principal place of business or to any officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action. Nothing in this Article II, Section 9 shall require the Board of Directors to take any action with respect to any proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought other than to fix a record date as provided for herein; and the fixing of any such record date shall not be deemed to be an action taken by the Board of Directors with respect to any such proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought for any other purpose.
SECTION 10. INSPECTORS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by Article II, Section 9, to the Company of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Company shall engage nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such
 
 
 
date as the independent inspectors certify to the Company that the consents delivered to the Company in accordance with Article II, Section 9 represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any shareholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
SECTION 11. EFFECTIVENESS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each shareholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with Article II, Section 9, a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to the Company in the manner prescribed in Article II, Section 9.

BD Completes Acquisition of GeneOhm Sciences, Inc.
 
Franklin Lakes, NJ (February 14, 2006)
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE:BDX) today announced the completion of its acquisition of GeneOhm Sciences, Inc., a pioneer in the development of molecular diagnostic testing for the rapid detection of bacterial organisms, including those known to cause healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), a growing global healthcare problem. The acquisition was finalized in accordance with terms originally disclosed in an announcement issued by BD on January 10, 2006.
 
The acquisition of GeneOhm Sciences is a natural complement to BD's core strengths in microbiology and validates its commitment to expansion in molecular diagnostics. It will enable BD to move quickly into the emerging HAI field and positions the Company to become a leader in the prevention of this global healthcare problem.
 
BD will implement a broad, global initiative to work with hospitals, governments and other related parties to address the challenge of reducing HAIs. The GeneOhm Sciences array of rapid molecular assays for detection of these "super bugs" will offer important tools to address the diagnostic challenge of providing almost immediate detection of these harmful, infection-causing organisms. Ensuring prompt identification of bacteria, such as MRSA (methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus
), enables the appropriate and directed drug therapy to commence sooner, and it can significantly impact patient and economic outcomes, a primary customer expectation. BD expects to bring its proven educational, training and in-service resources to this problem to assist physicians, nurses and others in a highly collaborative effort to reduce illness and mortality associated with HAIs.
 
This acquisition further demonstrates BD's commitment to bringing new technologies and innovation to difficult problems in healthcare.

BD Medical Notifies Blood Glucose Monitor Users in the US and Canada About a Potential Malfunction with its Meters
 
Franklin Lakes, NJ (February 17, 2006) 
BD Medical, a segment ofBD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE:BDX), announced today that it is voluntarily notifying all users of all of its blood glucose meters about a potential malfunction which could affect the units of measure displayed on the meters. If this malfunction does occur and goes unnoticed, it is possible that users may misinterpret their test results and change their diet or medication in a way that can result in temporary periods of high or low blood glucose that may require medical intervention.
 
The affected meters are sold in the United States and Canada under the brand names of: BD Logic, BD Latitude, Paradigm Link, and The Link Blood Glucose Monitors. To date no confirmed injuries or adverse health events have been reported, and BD is not requesting the return of product from the market. The users of these products were notified about this potential malfunction beginning in January.
 
The blood glucose meters sold in the US are designed to display results in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). On very rare occasions these meters may switch the glucose test result display from "mg/dL" to "mmol/L." The glucose meters sold in Canada are designed to display results in millimoles per Liter (mmol/L). On very rare occasions these meters may switch the glucose test result display from "mmol/L" to "mg/dL." Switching might happen during an event such as installing a battery or dropping the meter. This could lead to the misinterpretation of test results.
 
Users can continue to use their meter to test their blood glucose, but should confirm their meter's unit of measure (mg/dL or mmol/L) every time they test. If the meter is displaying the incorrect unit of measure, the user should disregard the reading and contact BD at 1-866-556-8123 for further instructions.
 
Patient safety and the efficacy of our products are BD's top priorities. BD is informing its registered users, as well as all customers, including distributors, retailers and healthcare professionals, of this issue. Special instructions are being inserted into each new meter and test strip package. BD is working with the US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada on this notification.

To be timely, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Company not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders;

In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of shareholder's notice as described above.

Each holder of preferred stock of any series shall have such voting powers, if any, as the Board of Directors shall have fixed by resolution prior to the issuance of any shares of such series. Whenever any action is to be taken by vote of the shareholders, it shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of the shareholders by the holders of shares entitled to vote, unless a greater plurality is required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation.

RECORD DATE FOR ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT. In order that the Company may determine the shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Company by delivery to its registered office in New Jersey, its principal place of business or to any officer or agent of the Company having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Company's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action. Nothing in this Article II, Section 9 shall require the Board of Directors to take any action with respect to any proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought other than to fix a record date as provided for herein; and the fixing of any such record date shall not be deemed to be an action taken by the Board of Directors with respect to any such proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought for any other purpose.
SECTION 10. INSPECTORS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by Article II, Section 9, to the Company of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Company shall engage nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such
 
 
 
date as the independent inspectors certify to the Company that the consents delivered to the Company in accordance with Article II, Section 9 represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any shareholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
SECTION 11. EFFECTIVENESS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each shareholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with Article II, Section 9, a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to the Company in the manner prescribed in Article II, Section 9.

ITEM 2.02
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
On April 26, 2006, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the second fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2006. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted principles (GAAP), as follows:
We also present income taxes and effective tax rate for the prior year's period after excluding the effects of significant reversals of tax reserves and the effects of changes in tax laws and regulations and other events that caused the tax rate for the period presented to vary from BD's then expected effective tax rate for the full year. Significant reversals of tax reserves and the items mentioned above that effect our periodic effective tax rate cause fluctuations in BD's income from continuing operations from period to period that management believes are unrelated to BD's underlying operating performance. Accordingly, management believes that providing the impact of such effects allows investors to better understand BD's comparative operating performance for the periods presented.
We also present income from operations for the prior year's first six months after excluding the effects of significant reversals of tax reserves and the effects of changes in tax laws and regulations and other events that caused the tax rate for the quarter to vary from BD's then expected effective tax rate for the full year. For the reasons discussed above, management believes that providing the impact of such effects allows investors to better understand BD's comparative operating performance for the periods presented.
 
 
 
 
We also present earnings per share from continuing operations on a prospective basis after excluding the aforementioned settlements and charge and the dilutive impact of the GeneOhm acquisition. Management excludes the impact of the GeneOhm operations in order to improve the comparability of the period presented to prior periods where such impact was not recorded.
We also present earnings per share from continuing operations for prior periods after excluding (i) the effects of significant reversals of tax reserves, (ii) the effects of changes in tax laws and regulations and other events that caused the tax rate during the period to vary from BD's expected effective tax rate for the full year, and/or (iii) the impact on taxes of the planned repatriation of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. These items cause fluctuations in BD's operating results that management believes are unrelated to BD's underlying operating performance. Accordingly, management believes that providing the impact of such items allows investors to better understand BD's comparative operating performance for the periods presented.
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.

 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported record quarterly revenues of $1.449 billion for the second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2006, representing an increase of 6 percent over the prior year period. This quarter's growth rate reflects an overall estimated 3 percent unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, which affected all segments.
Franklin Lakes, NJ (April 26, 2006)
"We are very pleased with our strong second quarter results, which exceeded our expectations," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We also closed the acquisition of GeneOhm, which will enable BD to further progress in the emerging field of healthcare-associated infections. The Company is well positioned to become a leader in the prevention and management of this global healthcare problem."
On February 14, 2006, BD announced the completion of its acquisition of GeneOhm Sciences, Inc. (GeneOhm), a company that has pioneered the development of molecular diagnostic testing for the rapid detection of bacteria, which cause healthcare-associated infections. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter reflects a reduction of 1 cent per share related to the impact of GeneOhm operations for the second quarter. For the full fiscal year 2006, the Company expects diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be reduced by approximately 7 cents related to the impact of GeneOhm operations. In addition, in the second quarter, the Company recorded an in-process research and development charge of $53 million associated with the acquisition, which further reduced diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by 21 cents in the quarter (see Table 1).
GeneOhm Sciences, Inc. Acquisition Completed
The following analysis of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter and six-month period of fiscal 2006 and 2005 identifies specified items that affect the comparability of results between periods.
Analysis of Second Quarter and Six-month Period of Fiscal Year 2006 and 2005 Earnings
As illustrated in Table 1, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items and including the dilutive impact on operating results from the acquisition, of 79 cents for the second fiscal quarter of 2006 increased by 11 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 71 cents for the second fiscal quarter of 2005. For the six-month period, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items and including the dilutive impact on operating results from the acquisition, of $1.62 for fiscal 2006 increased by 17 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, of $1.38 for fiscal 2005.
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $795 million, representing an increase of 9 percent from the prior year period. Strong sales in the Diabetes Care and Pharmaceutical Systems units contributed to the growth of the segment U.S. sales of safety-engineered products totaled $123 million compared with $115 million in the prior year's quarter. The growth rate of safety-engineered products benefited, in part, from a favorable comparison to the prior year's revenues, which were negatively impacted by reductions in inventory by a major U.S. distributor. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2006, U.S. sales of safety-engineered products totaled $255 million compared with $241 million in the prior year's period. Included in BD Medical revenues were international sales of safety-engineered products of $22 million compared with $21 million in the prior year's quarter. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2006, international sales of safety-engineered products totaled $44 million compared with $39 million in the prior year's period. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2006, the BD Medical segment reported 10 percent revenue growth.
Segment Results
.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $434 million, representing an increase of 1 percent from the prior year period. The Preanalytical Systems unit of the segment reported revenue growth of 11 percent, benefiting from both BD Vacutainer Push Button Blood Collection Set sales in the current year's quarter and a favorable comparison to the prior year's revenues, which were negatively impacted by reductions in inventory by a major U.S. distributor. U.S. sales of safety-engineered products totaled $97 million compared with $79 million in the prior year's quarter. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2006, U.S. sales of safety-engineered products totaled $193 million compared with $165 million in the prior year's period. Included in Preanalytical Systems revenues were international sales of safety-engineered products of $55 million compared with $47 million in the prior year's quarter. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2006, international sales of safety-engineered products totaled $107 million compared with $91 million in the prior year's period. Second quarter revenues in the Diagnostic Systems unit of the segment declined 8%, despite strong sales from diagnostic instrument platforms. For the most part, this decline in revenues was due to a relatively mild flu season in fiscal 2006 compared with 2005, in both Japan and the U.S. To a lesser extent, second quarter revenues were negatively impacted by the timing of early sales of flu diagnostic tests in the first fiscal quarter of 2006 and a challenging comparison to exceptionally strong sales of flu diagnostic tests in the prior year's quarter in Japan. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2006, the BD Diagnostics segment reported 4 percent revenue growth.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues from continuing operations for the quarter were $220 million, representing an increase of 8 percent from the prior year period. Flow cytometry instrument and reagent sales continued to be the primary growth contributors. Sales in the Discovery Labware unit as well as sales of cell imaging products also contributed to sales growth. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2006, the BD Biosciences segment reported 9 percent revenue growth, representing continued strong sales of flow cytometry instruments and reagents.
Second quarter revenues in the U.S. were $702 million, representing an increase of 11 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside the U.S. were $748 million, representing an increase of 2 percent over the prior year period, and reflected an estimated 5 percent unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.
Geographic Results
For the six-month period ended March 31, 2006, revenues in the U.S. were $1.383 billion, representing an increase of 10 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $1.481 billion, representing an increase of 6 percent over the prior year period, and reflected an estimated 4 percent unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.
The following analysis of estimated diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the third and fourth fiscal quarters and full fiscal year identifies specified items that affect the comparability of results between periods.
Fiscal 2006 Outlook for Third and Fourth Quarters and Full Year
As illustrated in Table 2, the Company estimates that diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, including the expected dilutive impact on operating results from the acquisition, will increase approximately 3-5 percent for the third fiscal quarter of 2006 over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, of 74 cents for the third fiscal quarter of 2005. Excluding the expected dilutive impact of 3 cents on operating results from the acquisition, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the third fiscal quarter of 2006 are expected to be in the 79 to 81 cent range, representing an increase of 7-9 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, of 74 cents for the third fiscal quarter of 2005.
The Company also estimates that diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, including the expected dilutive impact on operating results from the acquisition, will increase approximately 5-8 percent for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2006 over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, of 76 cents for the fiscal year 2005. Excluding the expected dilutive impact of 3 cents on operating results from the acquisition, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2006 are expected to be in the 83 to 85 cent range, representing an increase of 9-12 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, of 76 cents for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2005.
For the full fiscal year 2006, the Company estimates that diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, and including the expected dilutive impact on operating results from the acquisition, are expected to be in the $3.18 to $3.22 range, representing an increase of approximately 10-12 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding
specified items, of $2.88 for the fiscal year 2005. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full year 2006, excluding specified items and the expected dilutive impact of 7 cents on operating results from the acquisition, are expected to be in the $3.25 to $3.29 range, representing an increase of 13-14 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, of $2.88 for the fiscal year 2005.

ITEM 2.02
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
On July 28, 2006, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the third fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2006. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted principles (GAAP), as follows:
We also present income taxes and effective tax rate for the prior year periods after excluding the effects of significant reversals of tax reserves and/or the effects of changes in tax laws and regulations and other events that caused the tax rate for the period presented to vary from BD's then expected effective tax rate for the full year. Significant reversals of tax reserves and the items mentioned above that effect our periodic effective tax rate cause fluctuations in BD's income from continuing operations from period to period that management believes are unrelated to BD's underlying operating performance. Accordingly, management believes that providing the impact of such effects allows investors to better understand BD's comparative operating performance for the periods presented.
We also present income from operations for the prior year periods after excluding the effects of significant reversals of tax reserves and/or the effects of changes in tax laws and regulations and other events that caused the tax rate for the period presented to vary from BD's then expected effective tax rate for the full year. For the reasons discussed above, management believes that providing the impact of such effects allows investors to better understand BD's comparative operating performance for the periods presented.
 
 
 
 
We also present earnings per share from continuing operations for prior periods after excluding (i) the effects of significant reversals of tax reserves, (ii) the effects of changes in tax laws and regulations and other events that caused the tax rate during the period to vary from BD's expected effective tax rate for the full year, and/or (iii) the impact on taxes of the planned repatriation of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. These items cause fluctuations in BD's operating results that management believes are unrelated to BD's underlying operating performance. Accordingly, management believes that providing the impact of such items allows investors to better understand BD's comparative operating performance for the periods presented.
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.

Spinella, Investor Relations - 201-847-5453 BD Makes Filing to Report Bid to Acquire TriPath Imaging, Inc. Franklin Lakes, NJ (August XX, 2006) - BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE:BDX) today filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a Statement on Schedule 13D setting forth a proposal it made to acquire for a cash purchase price of $9.25 per share, or approximately $XXX million, the approximately 93.5% of the outstanding shares of TriPath Imaging, Inc. (Nasdaq:TPTH) which BD does not currently own. Tripath Imaging develops, manufactures, markets and sells innovative solutions to improve the clinical management of cancer, including detection, diagnosis, staging and treatment. The proposal was solicited by Tripath Imaging in connection with the culmination by Tripath Imaging of a process to explore strategic alternatives. BD's proposal states that it is conditioned upon, among other things, approval of the offer by the Tripath Imaging board of directors and the BD board of directors, the prompt negotiation of mutually acceptable definitive agreements, satisfactory completion of due diligence, and the obtaining of necessary regulatory approvals. Assuming that BD's proposal is accepted and definitive agreements are executed, it would be anticipated that the transaction would close during the first quarter of BD's 2007 fiscal year. BD and Tripath Imaging have participated in a collaboration to identify bio-markers for various cancer diagnostics since 2001, at which time BD acquired the approximately 6.5% equity interest that it currently holds and filed a Statement on Schedule 13G to reflect these holdings. The proposed acquisition of Tripath Imaging, which would be expected to have a negligible impact on BD's fiscal 2007 earnings (excluding an anticipated charge for in-process research and development), fits strategically with BD's objective of accelerating and advancing its presence in the cancer diagnostics market.

Exhibit 99.1 Contact: - ------- Colleen T. White, Corporate Communications - 201-847-5369 Patricia A. Spinella, Investor Relations - 201-847-5453 BD Makes Filing to Report Bid to Acquire TriPath Imaging, Inc. Franklin Lakes, N.J. -- Monday, August 14, 2006 -- BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE:BDX) today filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a Statement on Schedule 13D setting forth a proposal it made to acquire for a cash purchase price of $9.25 per share, or approximately $350 million, the approximately 93.5% of the outstanding shares of TriPath Imaging, Inc. (Nasdaq:TPTH) which BD does not currently own. TriPath Imaging develops, manufactures, markets and sells innovative solutions to improve the clinical management of cancer, including detection, diagnosis, staging and treatment. The proposal was solicited by TriPath Imaging in connection with the culmination by TriPath Imaging of a process to explore strategic alternatives. BD's proposal states that it is conditioned upon, among other things, approval of the offer by the TriPath Imaging board of directors, the prompt negotiation of mutually acceptable definitive agreements, satisfactory completion of due diligence, and the obtaining of necessary regulatory approvals. Assuming that BD's proposal is accepted and definitive agreements are executed, it would be anticipated that the transaction would close during the first quarter of BD's 2007 fiscal year. BD and TriPath Imaging have participated in a collaboration to identify bio-markers for various cancer diagnostics since 2001, at which time BD acquired the approximately 6.5% equity interest that it currently holds and filed a Statement on Schedule 13G to reflect these holdings. The proposed acquisition of TriPath Imaging, which would be expected to be minimally dilutive to BD's fiscal 2007 earnings (excluding an anticipated charge for in-process research and development), fits strategically with BD's objective of accelerating and advancing its presence in the cancer diagnostics market. BD will provide guidance for fiscal 2007 during its fiscal fourth quarter earnings call on November 2, 2006. About BD BD, a leading global medical technology company that makes and sells medical devices, instrumented systems and reagents, is dedicated to improving people's health throughout the world. BD is focused on improving drug therapy, enhancing the quality and speed of diagnosing infectious diseases, and advancing research and discovery of new drugs and vaccines. The Company's capabilities are instrumental in combating many of the world's most pressing diseases. Founded in 1897 and headquartered in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, BD employs more than 25,000 people in approximately 50 countries throughout the world. The Company serves healthcare institutions, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, industry and the general public.

BD to Acquire TriPath Imaging, Inc.
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE:BDX) announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire the 93.5% of the outstanding shares of TriPath Imaging (Nasdaq:TPTH) which BD does not currently own, for a cash purchase price of $9.25 per share, or approximately $350 million. The acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of BDs first fiscal quarter 2007 following the satisfaction of the conditions to the closing that include antitrust clearance and other customary conditions, and the requisite approval by the TriPath Imaging shareholders. TriPath Imaging has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to hold a special meeting of its shareholders, as promptly as practicable, for the purpose of considering the acquisition and to file a proxy statement and solicit proxies in favor of its approval.
Franklin Lakes, NJ (September 8, 2006)
TriPath Imaging develops, manufactures, markets and sells innovative solutions to improve the clinical management of cancer, including detection, diagnosis, staging and treatment. Since 2001, BD has been collaborating with the company to identify bio-markers for various cancer diagnostics. Researchers worldwide use BDs flow cytometry systems for detection of lymphoma and leukemia, and these systems and related products fit well with TriPath Imagings diagnostics testing requirements. In addition to its existing cervical cancer screening technology, TriPath Imaging is developing molecular screening tools in the areas of breast, cervical, ovarian and prostate cancers.
Expanding BDs presence in cancer diagnostics is a key element of our strategy to drive revenue growth through innovation, stated Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of BD. Cancer remains one of the highest causes of death in the world. We believe that this acquisition positions BD to have significant impact in the marketplace and to advance treatments through more accurate and timely diagnosis, in line with our purpose of helping all people live healthy lives.
The combination of BDs and TriPath Imagings biomarkers, sample acquisition/processing, reagent systems and instrumentation technologies will provide BD with the technological foundation for innovative oncology management in cancer centers, hospitals and laboratories worldwide. These oncology management products are intended to span cancer screening, diagnosis, prognosis and therapy monitoring.
 
 
 We see two business opportunities arising from this acquisition. First, to continue driving TriPath Imagings cervical cancer screening business, and second, to align their innovative new technologies with BDs existing business strategies, said Vincent A. Forlenza, BD Executive Vice President. This acquisition is a natural complement to ongoing bio-marker research programs within BD, with the potential to leverage BD instrumentation.
As previously stated in BDs August 14, 2006 press release relating to its submission of a proposal to acquire TriPath, the acquisition is expected to be minimally dilutive to BDs fiscal 2007 earnings (excluding an anticipated charge for in-process research and development). BD will provide guidance for fiscal 2007 during its fiscal fourth quarter earnings call on November 2, 2006.
BD senior management will address this announcement at two upcoming investor healthcare conferences. Remarks will be webcast live and can be accessed from the BD corporate website at and will be available for replay for one week from the date of the presentation. Vincent A. Forlenza, Executive Vice President, will present at the Thomas Weisel Partners Healthcare Conference 2006 today at 9:45 a.m. (ET). Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, will present at the Bear Stearns 19 Annual Healthcare Conference on Tuesday, September 12, 2006 at 2:00 p.m. (ET).

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES.
On September 26, 2006, the Board of Directors of Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") approved a plan to exit the blood glucose monitoring ("BGM") market. In accordance with the plan, distribution of the BD Logic Blood Glucose Monitor will be discontinued immediately. BD will continue to distribute test strips for its customers through December 2007. The decision to exit the BGM market was made following an evaluation of the future outlook for the product line. BD's other diabetes products, including insulin syringes, pen needles and lancets, will not be affected.
 
BD estimates that it will record a pre-tax charge in its 2006 fiscal fourth quarter of approximately $50 to $70 million ($33 to $47 million after-tax), or approximately $0.13 to $0.18 per diluted share from continuing operations, in connection with its decision to exit the BGM product line. This charge consists approximately of $27 to $41 million of inventory-related charges, $15 million of long-lived asset write-downs, $7 million of severance costs and $1 to $7 million of other exit costs. Of the foregoing charge, $25 to $45 million will result in future cash expenditures.
 
The above estimates of the charges to be incurred in connection with the exit from the BGM product line are based upon current expectations of BD and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual charges could vary materially from BD's estimates. Factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from BD's estimates include, but are not limited to, sales fluctuations of test strip inventory. BD does not intend to update any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof, except as required by applicable laws or regulations.

BD Announces Plan to Exit Blood Glucose Monitoring Market
Conference call with analysts and investors scheduled for 11:00 a.m. (ET)
 
Franklin Lakes, NJ (September 28, 2006)
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE:BDX) announced today that it will exit the blood glucose monitoring (BGM) market. This action impacts BD's blood glucose monitors and test strips only. BD's other diabetes products, including insulin syringes, pen needles and lancets, will not be affected.
 
"We evaluate all of our businesses on an ongoing basis, and this decision was made after careful consideration of our prospects and our ability to create and deliver value in this market," stated Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of BD. "We have concluded that our future outlook in an increasingly competitive market does not justify the levels of investment and additional resources necessary to continue. As a result, we made a difficult, but necessary, business decision to exit the blood glucose monitoring market."
 
BD entered the blood glucose monitoring market in early 2003 with the introduction of the BD Logic Blood Glucose Monitor. Distribution of BD Logic monitors will be discontinued immediately. BD is working with suppliers of other blood glucose systems that use BD Test Strips to continue to supply compatible meters for a limited period. To ensure that customers have sufficient time to consult with their healthcare teams and transition to new blood glucose monitoring systems, BD Test Strips will be distributed until December 2007.
 
BD estimates that it will record a pre-tax charge in its fiscal fourth quarter of approximately $50 to $70 million ($33 to $47 million after taxes), or approximately $0.13 to $0.18 per share, in connection with its decision to exit the BGM product line. The charge relates to the write-off of inventory and other assets as well as severance and other exit costs. BD estimates that the fiscal 2006 results represented by BGM will be approximately $105 million in revenues, excluding approximately $10 million associated with lancet products which will remain part of BD's existing diabetes care product offering, and approximately $0.07 per share in operating losses (not including the aforementioned charge). The Company expects BGM revenues in the range of $30 to $50 million in fiscal year 2007 as customers transition to alternative blood glucose monitoring products. The estimated impact on the Company's earnings per share in connection with such revenues is not expected to be significant. BD will report its fiscal 2006 consolidated results on Thursday, November 2, 2006.

BD remains solidly committed to its diabetes care business. The Company developed the first syringe dedicated to insulin delivery in 1924 and has made continuous advances ever since, leading to revenue derived from insulin delivery products that exceeds $500 million annually.

A conference call regarding this announcement will be broadcast live on BD's website, www.bd.com/investors, at 11:00 a.m. (ET) today. The conference call will be available for replay through the close of business on October 5, 2006 on BD's website, www.bd.com/investors, or at

BD ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER AND FULL YEAR
 
Franklin Lakes, NJ (November 2, 2006)
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported record quarterly revenues of $1.488 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2006, representing an increase of 8 percent over the prior year period. This quarter's growth rate reflects the favorable impact on all segments from foreign currency translation, which overall is estimated to account for 2 percentage points of the growth.
 
For the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, BD reported record revenues of $5.835 billion, representing an increase of 8 percent over the prior year, which reflects an overall estimated 1 percent unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation that affected all segments.
 
"We are proud of our accomplishments during 2006 and enthusiastic about our outlook for 2007," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our revenue and earnings growth exceeded our expectations and give us continuing confidence that our strategy is sound and our implementation is disciplined. We remain committed to serving our customers with products that make a difference in healthcare, and we will continue to work diligently to deliver value to our shareholders."

On September 28, 2006, the Company announced a plan to exit the blood glucose monitoring ("BGM") market. As a result of this decision, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $63 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2006. This charge consists of $5 million related to estimated customer returns, $46 million associated with the write-off of inventory, related purchase commitments and long-lived assets, and $12 million related to severance and other exit costs.

Planned Acquisition of TriPath Imaging
On September 8, 2006 the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire the 93.5% of the outstanding shares of TriPath Imaging that BD does not currently own. The acquisition expands BD's presence in cancer diagnostics, which is a key element of the Company's strategy to drive revenue growth through innovation. We received U.S. antitrust clearance for this acquisition on October 27, 2006. Following the requisite approval by the TriPath Imaging shareholders, as well as other customary closing conditions, the acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of BD's first fiscal quarter 2007. As previously stated, the acquisition is expected to be minimally dilutive to BD's fiscal 2007 earnings (excluding an anticipated charge for in-process research and development) and is included in our estimated guidance discussed below.
 
Fiscal 2007 Outlook for Full Year
 
The following analysis of estimated diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full fiscal year identifies specified items that affect the comparability of results between periods. As illustrated in Table 2, the Company estimates that diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full fiscal year 2007 will be in the $3.69 to $3.75 range, representing an increase of approximately 12 to 14 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, of $3.28 for the fiscal year 2006.
 
 
Includes the minimally dilutive effect on estimated diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2007 relating to the operations of TriPath Imaging, which the Company expects to acquire by the end of the first fiscal quarter 2007. Does not include anticipated in-process research and development charge, which would be recorded upon closing of the acquisition.

ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
 
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted principles (GAAP), as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
BD's underlying performance, and also allow investors to better understand BD's comparative operating performance for the period presented.
 
 
 
 
We also present earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 after excluding the impact of insurance settlements, and for the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 and the full 2006 fiscal year after excluding the impact of these settlements and the in-process R&D charge relating to the GeneOhm acquisition. These items affected reported earnings per share for the period in which they occurred, but are not considered by management to be part of ordinary operations. Accordingly, management believes that these adjusted
 
measures of earnings per share are more indicative of BD's underlying performance, and also allow investors to better understand BD's comparative performance for the period presented.
 
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
 
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.
 
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.

BD ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR FIRST FISCAL QUARTER
 
Franklin Lakes, NJ (January 25, 2007)
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported record quarterly revenues of $1.502 billion for the first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2006, representing an increase of 8 percent over the prior year period. This quarter's growth rate reflects the favorable impact on all segments from foreign currency translation, which overall is estimated to account for 2 percentage points of the growth.
 
"We are pleased with our strong start to fiscal 2007," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Increased sales of safety-engineered devices, prefillable drug delivery devices, and Biosciences products demonstrate the breadth of our growth drivers. Higher margin products and increased operating effectiveness continued to expand our operating profit margin. This performance has enabled us to increase the pace of our R&D spending while delivering double-digit earnings growth."
 
TriPath Imaging Acquisition Completed
On December 20, 2006, BD completed its acquisition of TriPath Imaging, a maker of innovative solutions to improve the clinical management of cancer. The Company recorded an in-process research and development charge of $115 million associated with the acquisition, which reduced diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by 45 cents in the first quarter (see Table 1 below).
 
 
 
 
BGM Product Line Sold
Following the receipt of an unsolicited offer during the quarter, the Company sold the blood glucose monitoring (BGM) product line for $20 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $15 million. Consequently, the results of operations of the BGM product line have been classified as discontinued operations for all quarters and years referred to in this release. Included in the attached financial tables are the Company's Consolidated Income Statements for fiscal year 2006, which reflect this classification change.
 
Analysis of First Quarter Fiscal Year 2007 and 2006 Earnings
Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was 51 cents for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, which included the in-process research and development charge of 45 cents related to the TriPath acquisition.

(d) if termination is by reason of the death of the Participant, each Option or Stock Appreciation Right held by the Participant may be exercised by the Participant's estate, or by any person who acquires the right to exercise such Award by reason of the Participant's death, to the extent of the total number of shares subject to the Award, irrespective of the extent to which such Award would have otherwise been exercisable pursuant to the terms of the Award at the date of death, and such Award shall otherwise remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.
Section 11.
General Provisions Applicable To Awards.
(a) Awards shall be granted for no cash consideration or for such minimal cash consideration as may be required by applicable law.
(b) Awards may, in the discretion of the Committee, be granted either alone or in addition to or in tandem with any other Award. Awards granted in addition to or in tandem with other Awards may be granted either at the same time as or at a different time from the grant of such other Awards or awards.
(c) Subject to the terms of the Plan, payments or transfers to be made by the Company upon the grant, exercise or payment of an Award may be made in such form or forms as the Committee shall determine including, without limitation, cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards, or other property, or any combination thereof, and may be made in a single payment or transfer, in installments, or on a deferred basis, in each case in accordance with rules and procedures established by the Committee. Such rules and procedures may include, without limitation, provisions for the payment or crediting of reasonable interest on installment or deferred payments or the grant or crediting of dividend equivalents in respect of installment or deferred payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company extend any loan to any Participant in connection with the exercise of an Award; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prohibit the Company from maintaining or establishing any broker-assisted cashless exercise program.
(d) Unless the Committee shall otherwise determine, no Award and no right under any Award shall be assignable, alienable, saleable or transferable by a Participant otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. In no event may an Award be transferred by a Participant for value. Each Award, and each right under any Award, shall be exercisable during the Participant's lifetime only by the Participant or, if permissible under applicable law, by the Participant's guardian or legal representative. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to any Award which has been fully exercised, earned or paid, as the case may be, and shall not preclude forfeiture of an Award in accordance with the terms thereof.
(e) All certificates for Shares or other securities delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award or the exercise thereof shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the Plan or the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon which such Shares or other securities are then listed, and any applicable Federal or state securities laws, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.
(f) Every Award (other than an Option or Stock Appreciation Right) to a member of the Executive Group shall, if the Committee intends that such Award should constitute "qualified performance-based compensation" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code, include a pre-established formula, such that payment, retention or vesting of the Award is subject to the achievement during a performance period or periods, as determined by the Committee, of a level or levels, as determined by the Committee, of one or more of the following performance measures: (i) Return on Net Assets, (ii) Revenue Growth, (iii) Return on Common Equity, (iv) Total Shareholder Return, (v) Earnings Per Share, (vi) Net Revenue Per Employee (vii) Market Share, (viii)
Return on Invested Capital, or (ix) Net Income. For any Award subject to any such pre-established formula, no more than 150,000 Shares can be paid in satisfaction of such Award to any Participant, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5(e). Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, the Committee shall not be authorized to increase the amount payable under any Award to which this Section 11(f) applies upon attainment of such pre-established formula.
(g) Unless specifically provided to the contrary in any Award Agreement, upon a Change in Control, all Awards shall become fully vested and exercisable, and any restrictions applicable to any Award shall automatically lapse.
(h) Non-employee Directors of the Company shall be entitled to defer the receipt of any Shares that may become issuable to them under any Award in accordance with the terms of the 1996 Directors' Deferral Plan, as the same may be hereinafter amended, or any other plan that may be established by the Company that provides for the deferred receipt of such Shares.
(i) Employees of the Company shall be entitled to defer the receipt of any Shares that may become issuable to them under any Award in accordance with the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan, as the same may be hereinafter amended, or any other plan that may be established by the Company that provides for the deferred receipt of such Shares.
Section 12.
Amendments And Termination.
(a) Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law and unless otherwise expressly provided in an Award Agreement or in the Plan, the Board may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue, or terminate the Plan or any portion thereof at any time; , that no such amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuation or termination shall be made without (i) shareholder approval (A) if the effect thereof is to increase the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan or to expand the class of persons eligible to participate in the Plan or (B) if such approval is necessary to comply with any tax or regulatory requirement for which or with which the Board deems it necessary or desirable to qualify or comply or (ii) the consent of the affected Participant, if such action would adversely affect the rights of such Participant under any outstanding Award. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Committee may amend the Plan in such manner as may be necessary to enable the Plan to achieve its stated purposes in any jurisdiction outside the United States in a tax-efficient manner and in compliance with local rules and regulations.
provided, however
(b) The Committee may waive any conditions or rights under, amend any terms of, or amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate, any Award theretofore granted, prospectively or retroactively, without the consent of any relevant Participant or holder or beneficiary of an Award, , that no such action shall impair the rights of any affected Participant or holder or beneficiary under any Award theretofore granted under the Plan; and that, except as provided in Section 5(e), no such action shall reduce the exercise price, grant price or purchase price of any Award established at the time of grant thereof and, that the Committee's authority under this Section 12(b) is limited in the case of Awards subject to Section 11(f), as set forth in Section 11(f). In no event shall an outstanding Option or Stock Appreciation Right be cancelled and replaced with a new Option or Stock Appreciation Right with a lower exercise price, without approval of the Company's shareholders, except as provided in Section 5(e).
provided, however
provided further
provided further
(c) Except as noted in Section 11(f), the Committee shall be authorized to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, Awards in recognition of events (including, without limitation, the events described in Section 5(e)) affecting the Company, or the financial statements of the Company, or of changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles, whenever the Committee determines that such adjustments are appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan.
(d) Any provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in connection with a Business Combination, the Committee may cause any Award granted hereunder to be canceled in consideration of a cash payment or alternative Award made to the holder of such canceled Award equal in value to the Fair Market Value of such canceled Award.
(e) The Committee may correct any defect, supply any omission, or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or any Award in the manner and to the extent it shall deem desirable to carry the Plan into effect.
Section 13.
Miscellaneous.
(a) No employee, Participant or other person shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of employees, Participants, or holders or beneficiaries of Awards under the Plan. The terms and conditions of Awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient.
(b) The Committee may delegate to one or more officers or managers of the Company, or a committee of such officers or managers, the authority, subject to such terms and limitations as the Committee shall determine, to grant Awards to, or to cancel, modify, waive rights with respect to, alter, discontinue, suspend or terminate Awards held by, employees who are not officers or directors of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; , that any delegation to management shall conform with the requirements of the corporate law of New Jersey and with the requirements, if any, of the New York Stock Exchange, in either case as in effect from time to time.
provided, however
(c) The Company shall be authorized to withhold from any Award granted or any payment due or transfer made under any Award or under the Plan or from any compensation or other amount owing to a Participant the amount (in cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards, or other property) of withholding taxes due in respect of an Award, its exercise, or any payment or transfer under such Award or under the Plan and to take such other action (including, without limitation, providing for elective payment of such amounts in cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards or other property by the Participant) as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such taxes.
(d) Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company from adopting or continuing in effect other or additional compensation arrangements, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
(e) The grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any Affiliate. Further, the Company or the applicable Affiliate may at any time dismiss a Participant from employment, free from any liability, or any claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in any Award Agreement or in any other agreement binding the parties. The receipt of any Award under the Plan is not intended to confer any rights on the receiving Participant except as set forth in such Award.
(f) If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or as to any person or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or Award, and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.
(g) Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and a Participant or any other person. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company.
(h) No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award, and the Committee shall determine whether cash, other securities or other property shall be paid or transferred in lieu of any fractional Shares, or whether such fractional Shares or any rights thereto shall be canceled, terminated or otherwise eliminated.
Section 14.
Effective Date Of Plan.
The Plan shall be effective as of the date of its approval by the stockholders of the Company.
Section 15.
Term Of The Plan.
No Award shall be granted under the Plan after the tenth anniversary of the effective date. However, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in an applicable Award Agreement, any Award theretofore granted may extend beyond such date, and the authority of the Committee to amend, alter, adjust, suspend, discontinue, or terminate any such Award, or to waive any conditions or rights under any such Award, and the authority of the Board to amend the Plan, shall extend beyond such date.

In addition to any other applicable requirements, for nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors or for other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder, such shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the Company.
          
To be timely, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Company not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders;
provided
,
however
, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for on a date that is not within 30 days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder in order to be timely must be so received not earlier than the 120
th
day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90
th
day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above.
          
Notwithstanding anything in the first sentence of the preceding paragraph to the contrary, in the event that the number of Directors to be elected to the Board of Directors is increased and there is no notice or public disclosure by the Company naming all of the nominees for Director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least 70 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders, a shareholder's notice required by this Section 2.D. shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made.

provided
,
however
, that, once business has been properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with such procedures, nothing in this Section 2.D. shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any shareholder of any such business.

If a quorum not be present or represented at any meeting, the Chairman of the meeting or a majority of the shareholders present in person, or by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting without notice until the required voting shares shall be represented. At such adjourned meeting with the requisite amount of voting shares represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.
          
SECTION 4. NOTICE OF MEETINGS.

If mailed, the notice shall be directed to the shareholder at his or her address as it appears on the records of the stock transfer agent. Any shareholder, in person or by proxy, may at any time by a duly signed statement in writing to that effect, waive any statutory or other notice of any meeting, whether such statement be signed before or after such meeting.
          
SECTION 5. VOTING. At all meetings of the shareholders, each holder of common stock having the right to vote, and present at the meeting in person or by proxy, shall be entitled to one vote for each full share of common stock of the Company entitled to vote and registered in his or her name. Each holder of preferred stock of any series shall have such voting powers, if any, as the Board of Directors shall have fixed by resolution prior to the issuance of any shares of such series. Whenever any action is to be taken by vote of the shareholders, it shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast at a meeting
of the shareholders by the holders of shares entitled to vote, unless a greater plurality is required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation.
          
SECTION 6. PROXIES. Any shareholder of record entitled to vote may be represented at any annual or special meeting of the shareholders by a duly appointed proxy. All proxies shall be written and properly signed, but shall require no other attestation, and shall be filed with the Secretary of the meeting before being voted.
          
SECTION 7. ORGANIZATION. The Chairman of the Board, or in the absence of the Chairman of the Board, the President, shall act as chairman of the meeting at all meetings of the shareholders. The Secretary, or in his or her absence one of the Assistant Secretaries, shall act as secretary of the meeting. In case none of the officers above designated to act as Chairman or Secretary of the meeting shall be present, a chairman or a secretary of the meeting, as the case may be, shall be chosen by a vote of the shareholders.
          
SECTION 8. ORDER OF BUSINESS. The order of business at all meetings of the shareholders shall be as determined by the Chairman of the meeting, but the order of business to be followed at any meeting at which a quorum is present may be changed by a vote of the shareholders.
          
SECTION 9. RECORD DATE FOR ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT. In order that the Company may determine the shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Company by delivery to its registered office in New Jersey, its principal place of business or to any officer or agent of the Company having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Company's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
Nothing in this Article II, Section 9 shall require the Board of Directors to take any action with respect to any proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought other than to fix a record date as provided for herein; and the fixing of any such record date shall
not be deemed to be an action taken by the Board of Directors with respect to any such proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought for any other purpose.
          
SECTION 10. INSPECTORS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by Article II, Section 9, to the Company of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Company shall engage nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Company that the consents delivered to the Company in accordance with Article II, Section 9 represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any shareholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
          
SECTION 11. EFFECTIVENESS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each shareholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with Article II, Section 9, a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to the Company in the manner prescribed in Article II, Section 9.
          
SECTION 1. QUALIFICATIONS. Each Director shall be at least 21 years of age and shall be elected in the manner provided by these By-Laws.

There shall be an annual meeting of the Board of Directors held without notice on the date of the annual meeting of shareholders, or as soon thereafter as convenient, at the same place as the annual meeting of shareholders unless some other location is designated by the Chairman of the Board or by the President. Regular meetings, without notice, may be held at such time and place as the Board of Directors may designate. The Chairman of the Board or the President may call any special meeting of the Board of Directors, and shall do so whenever requested in writing by at least one-third of the Directors. Notice of each special meeting shall be mailed to each Director at least four days before the date on which the meeting is to be held, or be telephoned or sent to each Director by telegraph, telex, TWX, cable, wireless or similar means of communication, or be delivered in person, not later than the day before the date on which such meeting is to be held.

The attendance of any Director at a meeting without protesting prior to the conclusion of the meeting the lack of notice of such meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice by him or her. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting. Notice of an adjourned meeting need not be given if the time and place are fixed at the meeting adjourning, and if the period of adjournment does not exceed 10 days in any one adjournment.

The corporate officers shall be elected by the Board of Directors and shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the Board of Directors, subject to the power of the Board of Directors to remove any corporate officer at its pleasure by an affirmative vote of the majority of the Directors then in office.
          
Every corporate officer shall have such authority and perform such duties in the management of the Company as may be provided in these By-laws, or such duties consistent with these By-laws as may be assigned by the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer.

ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
 
On April 25, 2007, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the second fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2007. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as follows:
Revenues
. We present revenue growth rates at constant foreign exchange rates. We believe that
presenting revenue growth rates at constant foreign exchange rates allows investors to view the
underlying operating results of BD and of its segments without the impact of fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating comparisons to prior periods.
Selling and Administrative Expense
. We present selling and administrative expense, both alone
and as a percentage of revenues, for the second quarter and for the first six months of fiscal year
2006 after excluding the impact of insurance settlements occurring during the period. These
settlements caused reported selling and administrative expense to be lower than it otherwise would
have been for the period in which they occurred, although these settlements are not considered part
of ordinary operations by management. Accordingly, we believe that measures of selling and
administrative expense that are adjusted for the effects of these settlements are more indicative of
BD's underlying performance and assist investors in comparing BD's selling and administrative
expense for the period to other periods.
Research and Development Expense
. We present research and development expense, both alone
and as a percentage of revenues, for the first six months of fiscal year 2007 after excluding the
impact of the in-process research and development ("R&D") charge relating to the acquisition of
TriPath Imaging, Inc. ("TriPath"). We also present these measures for the second quarter and first
six months of fiscal year 2006 after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charge relating to
the acquisition of GeneOhm Sciences Inc. ("GeneOhm"). These noncash charges are not
considered by management to be part of ordinary operations and served to increase reported R&D
expense for the period in which they were incurred. Management believes that these adjusted
measures are more indicative of BD's R&D activities for the period presented. Management also
presents these adjusted measures in order to assist investors in comparing BD's R&D expense for
the period to other periods.
Operating Income
. We present BD's operating income, both alone and as a percentage of revenues,
for the first six months of fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D
charge relating to the TriPath acquisition. We also present these measures for the second quarter
and first six months of fiscal year 2006 after excluding the impact of insurance settlements and the
in-process R&D charge relating to the GeneOhm acquisition. These items affected reported
operating income for the period in which they occurred, but are not considered by management to
be part of ordinary operations. Accordingly, management believes that these adjusted measures of
operating income are more indicative of BD's underlying performance, and also allow investors to
better understand BD's comparative operating performance for the period presented.
Income Taxes/Effective Tax Rate
. We present income taxes and effective tax rate for the second
quarter and first six months of fiscal year 2006 after excluding the impact of insurance settlements.
These settlements caused our reported income tax expense and effective tax rate to be higher than
they otherwise would have been for the period in which they occurred, although these settlements
are not considered part of ordinary operations by management. Management believes that these
adjusted measures of income taxes are more indicative of BD's underlying results, and also allow
investors to better understand BD's comparative income tax expense and tax rate for the period
presented.
 
 
 
Income from Continuing Operations
. We present BD's income from continuing operations, both
alone and as a percentage of revenues, for the first six months of fiscal year 2007 after excluding
the impact of the in-process R&D charge relating to the TriPath acquisition. We also present BD's
income from continuing operations, both alone and as a percentage of revenues, for the second
quarter and first six months of fiscal year 2006 after excluding the impact of insurance settlements
and the in-process R&D charge relating to the GeneOhm acquisition. These items affected
reported income from continuing operations for the period in which they occurred, but are not
considered by management to be part of ordinary operations. Accordingly, management believes
that these adjusted measures of income from continuing operations are more indicative of BD's
underlying performance, and also allow investors to better understand BD's comparative income
from continuing operations for the period presented.
We present earnings per share from continuing operations for the first six months of fiscal year 2007 (and projected earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2007) after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charge relating to the TriPath acquisition. This charge caused (or will cause) reported earnings per share for the period to be lower than it otherwise would have been, although the charge is not considered by management to be part of ordinary operations. We believe that a measure of earnings per share that is adjusted for the impact of this charge is more indicative of BD's underlying performance and also allows investors to more easily compare BD's results for the period to other periods.
Earnings Per Share.
We also present earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal year 2006, the first six months of fiscal year 2006 and the full 2006 fiscal year after excluding the impact of insurance settlements and the in-process R&D charge relating to the GeneOhm acquisition. These items affected reported earnings per share for the period in which they occurred, but are not considered by management to be part of ordinary operations. Accordingly, management believes that these adjusted measures of earnings per share are more indicative of BD's underlying performance, and also allow investors to better understand BD's comparative performance for the period presented.
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.

BD ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR SECOND FISCAL QUARTER
Second-quarter earnings per share from continuing operations increase 12% to 92 cents,
excluding specified items
Raises guidance for full fiscal year 2007 earnings per share from continuing operations to
$3.76 to $3.80 from $3.71 to $3.77, excluding specified items
Franklin Lakes, NJ (April 25, 2007)
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported record quarterly revenues of $1.576 billion for the second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2007, representing an increase of 11 percent over the prior year period. This quarter's growth rate reflects the favorable impact on all segments from foreign currency translation, which overall is estimated to account for 3 percentage points of the increase in quarterly revenues.
"We are pleased with the strength of our second quarter results and outlook for fiscal 2007. BD's strategy of providing innovative solutions to global healthcare needs continues to fuel our growth," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our improving gross margin is providing the necessary resources to invest for the future. The combination of our strong operations, internal investments in research and development and recent acquisitions of GeneOhm and TriPath provides the basis for us to look to the future with confidence."
Analysis of Second Quarter and Six-Month Period of Fiscal Year 2007 and 2006 Earnings
Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 92 cents for the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The following analysis (Table 1) of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarters of fiscal 2007 and 2006 identifies specified items that affect comparability of results between periods. As illustrated, second quarter fiscal 2007 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 12 percent over comparable second quarter fiscal 2006 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 82 cents, which exclude specified items. For the six-month periods, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.89 for fiscal 2007, which exclude specified item, increased by 13 percent over comparable fiscal 2006 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.67, which exclude specified items.

In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $844 million, representing an increase of 10 percent from the prior year period. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2007, the BD Medical segment reported 10 percent revenue growth. Strong sales in the Pharmaceutical Systems unit continued to significantly contribute to the growth of the segment.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $473 million, representing an increase of 11 percent from the prior year's quarter, despite continued slow sales of flu testing products. This growth includes $27 million of revenues from TriPath, which was acquired at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The Preanalytical Systems unit of the segment reported revenue growth of 8 percent. Second quarter revenues in the Diagnostic Systems unit of the segment increased 15 percent, again including revenues from the TriPath acquisition.

In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $259 million, representing an increase of 13 percent from the prior year's quarter. Flow cytometry instrument and reagent sales, as well as sales of advanced bioprocessing products, contributed to growth. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2007, the BD Biosciences segment reported 12 percent revenue growth, resulting from continued strong sales of those same products.
Geographic Results
Second quarter revenues in the U.S. were $754 million, representing an increase of 11 percent over the prior year period and include $27 million of revenues from TriPath. Revenues outside the U.S. were $822 million, representing an increase of 10 percent over the prior year period. Approximately 5 percentage points of the increase resulted from the favorable impact of foreign currency translation.
For the six-month period ended March 31, 2007, revenues in the U.S. were $1.475 billion, representing an increase of 10 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $1.603 billion, representing an increase of 8 percent over the prior year period.

ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.
 
As was previously reported by Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD"), bioMrieux SA has initiated an arbitration proceeding with the International Chamber of Commerce International Court of Arbitration in Paris, France, against GeneOhm Sciences Canada ("GeneOhm"), a subsidiary of BD. The arbitration relates to a sublicense agreement under which bioMrieux granted certain patent rights to GeneOhm relating to a method for the detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In the arbitration, bioMrieux alleges, among other things, that GeneOhm fraudulently induced bioMrieux into entering into the sublicense and assigned its rights in violation of the sublicense. bioMrieux is seeking monetary damages and to terminate the patent rights granted to GeneOhm under the sublicense agreement. The arbitration clause of the sublicense agreement provides that the arbitration will be held before a sole arbitrator, whose decision will be binding on both GeneOhm and bioMrieux. The loss of its rights under the sublicense with bioMrieux may adversely affect GeneOhm's ability to market its MRSA detection products. However, BD believes that there is no basis for bioMrieux to terminate the sublicense agreement and GeneOhm intends to vigorously defend its position in the arbitration proceedings.
 
Also as previously reported, BD received a letter from bioMrieux invoking the dispute resolution clause of a separate license agreement between BD and bioMrieux, under which bioMrieux grants patent rights to BD for certain licensed fields relating to BD's BACTEC products. In the letter, bioMrieux alleges that sales of BD's BACTEC products have been made in non-licensed fields and that such sales constitute a material breach of the license agreement. bioMrieux requests compensation for any non-licensed sales, as well as cessation of all future sales in non-licensed fields. BD believes there has been no material breach of the agreement and intends to follow the dispute resolution provisions to resolve the matter, while vigorously defending its position with respect to the alleged breach.

Item 8.01       Other Events
On June 15, 2007, Retractable Technologies, Inc. ("plaintiff") filed a complaint against Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") under the caption Retractable Technologies, Inc. vs. Becton Dickinson and Company (Civil Action No. 2:07-cv-250, United States District Court, Eastern District of Texas). Plaintiff alleges that the BD Integra syringes infringe patents licensed exclusively to the plaintiff. This patent claim was not covered by the release contained in the July 2004 settlement agreement between BD and plaintiff to settle the lawsuit previously filed by plaintiff.
In its complaint, plaintiff also alleges that BD engaged in false advertising with respect to certain of BD's safety-engineered products in violation of the Lanham Act; acted to exclude the plaintiff from various product markets and to maintain BD's market share through, among other things, exclusionary contracts in violation of state and Federal antitrust laws; and engaged in unfair competition. The non-patent claims purport to relate to actions allegedly taken by BD following the date of the July 2004 settlement agreement referenced above.
Plaintiff seeks treble damages, attorney's fees and injunctive relief. BD believes it has meritorious defenses to these claims and intends to vigorously defend this lawsuit.

Date: July 24, 2007
 
 
 

          
The registered office of Becton, Dickinson and Company ("Company") shall be in the Borough of Franklin Lakes, County of Bergen, State of New Jersey or such other place within or without the State of New Jersey as the Board of Directors may designate. The Company may also establish and have such other offices within or without the State of New Jersey, as the Board of Directors may designate or its business may require.
          
SECTION 1. PLACE OF MEETINGS. Meetings of the shareholders shall be held at the registered office of the Company in New Jersey, or at such other place, within or without the State of New Jersey, as may be designated by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting.
          
SECTION 2.A. ANNUAL MEETINGS. The annual meeting of shareholders for the election of Directors and the transaction of such other business as may be related to the purposes set forth in the notice of the meeting shall be held at such time as may be fixed by the Board of Directors.
          
B.           SPECIAL MEETING FOR ELECTION OF DIRECTORS. If the annual meeting of shareholders is not held on the date designated, the Board of Directors may call a special meeting of the shareholders for the election of Directors and the transaction of other business.
          
C.           SPECIAL MEETINGS. Special meetings of the shareholders may be called by the Board of Directors or by the Chairman of the Board or by the President, and shall be called by the Chairman of the Board or by the President upon written request of a majority of the Directors then in office, which request shall state the time, place and purpose of the meeting.
          
D.           ADVANCE NOTICE OF NOMINATIONS AND BUSINESS TO BE TRANSACTED AT ANNUAL MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS. No business may be transacted at an annual meeting of shareholders, other than business that is either (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof), (ii) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof), or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by any shareholder of the Company (A) who is a shareholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 2.D. and on the record date
for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote at such annual meeting, and (B) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.D.
          
In addition to any other applicable requirements, for nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors or for other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder, such shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the Company.
          
To be timely, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Company not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders;
provided
,
however
, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for on a date that is not within 30 days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder in order to be timely must be so received not earlier than the 120
th
day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90
th
day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above.
          
Notwithstanding anything in the first sentence of the preceding paragraph to the contrary, in the event that the number of Directors to be elected to the Board of Directors is increased and there is no notice or public disclosure by the Company naming all of the nominees for Director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least 70 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders, a shareholder's notice required by this Section 2.D. shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made.
          
To be in proper written form, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must set forth (i) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a Director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 14a-11 thereunder (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a Director if elected), (ii) as to each matter such shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (iii) the name and record address of such shareholder, (iv) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Company that are owned beneficially or of record by such shareholder, together with proof of ownership if requested by the Company, (v) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such shareholder and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with such nomination or proposal of such business by such shareholder and any material interest of such shareholder in such business, and (vi) a
representation that such shareholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such business before the meeting. In addition, a shareholder seeking to submit such business at an annual meeting shall promptly provide any other information reasonably requested by the Company.
          
No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of shareholders except business brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.D;
provided
,
however
, that, once business has been properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with such procedures, nothing in this Section 2.D. shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any shareholder of any such business. If the Chairman of an annual meeting determines that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the Chairman shall declare to the meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting and such business shall not be transacted.
          
The provisions of this Section 2.D shall not be applicable to any shareholder proposal submitted for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under Regulation 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
          
SECTION 3. QUORUM. The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of shares representing a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at a meeting shall constitute a quorum. The shareholders present in person or by proxy at a duly organized meeting may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum. If a quorum not be present or represented at any meeting, the Chairman of the meeting or a majority of the shareholders present in person, or by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting without notice until the required voting shares shall be represented. At such adjourned meeting with the requisite amount of voting shares represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.
          
SECTION 4. NOTICE OF MEETINGS. A written notice of each annual or special meeting of the shareholders of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board or the President or the Secretary, which shall state the time, place and purpose of such meeting, shall be delivered personally or mailed, not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days before the date of any such meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, the notice shall be directed to the shareholder at his or her address as it appears on the records of the stock transfer agent. Any shareholder, in person or by proxy, may at any time by a duly signed statement in writing to that effect, waive any statutory or other notice of any meeting, whether such statement be signed before or after such meeting.
          
SECTION 5. VOTING. At all meetings of the shareholders, each holder of common stock having the right to vote, and present at the meeting in person or by proxy, shall be entitled to one vote for each full share of common stock of the Company entitled to vote and registered in his or her name. Each holder of preferred stock of any series shall have such voting powers, if any, as the Board of Directors shall have fixed by resolution prior to the issuance of any shares of such series. Whenever any action is to be taken by vote of the shareholders, it shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast at a meeting
of the shareholders by the holders of shares entitled to vote, unless a greater plurality is required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation.
          
SECTION 6. PROXIES. Any shareholder of record entitled to vote may be represented at any annual or special meeting of the shareholders by a duly appointed proxy. All proxies shall be written and properly signed, but shall require no other attestation, and shall be filed with the Secretary of the meeting before being voted.
          
SECTION 7. ORGANIZATION. The Chairman of the Board, or in the absence or disability of the Chairman of the Board or if a vacancy exists in the office of the Chairman of the Board, a director or officer designated by the Board of Directors shall act as chairman of the meeting at all meetings of the shareholders. The Secretary, or in his or her absence or disability one of the Assistant Secretaries, shall act as secretary of the meeting. In case none of the officers above designated to act as secretary of the meeting shall be present, a Board of Directors secretary of the meeting shall be chosen by the Board of Directors.
          
SECTION 8. ORDER OF BUSINESS. The order of business at all meetings of the shareholders shall be as determined by the Chairman of the meeting, but the order of business to be followed at any meeting at which a quorum is present may be changed by a vote of the shareholders.
          
SECTION 9. RECORD DATE FOR ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT. In order that the Company may determine the shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Company by delivery to its registered office in New Jersey, its principal place of business or to any officer or agent of the Company having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Company's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
Nothing in this Article II, Section 9 shall require the Board of Directors to take any action with respect to any proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought other than to fix a record date as provided for herein; and the fixing of any such record date shall
not be deemed to be an action taken by the Board of Directors with respect to any such proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought for any other purpose.
          
SECTION 10. INSPECTORS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by Article II, Section 9, to the Company of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Company shall engage nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Company that the consents delivered to the Company in accordance with Article II, Section 9 represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any shareholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
          
SECTION 11. EFFECTIVENESS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each shareholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with Article II, Section 9, a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to the Company in the manner prescribed in Article II, Section 9.
          
SECTION 1. QUALIFICATIONS. Each Director shall be at least 21 years of age and shall be elected in the manner provided by these By-Laws.
          
SECTION 2. DUTIES AND POWERS. The Board of Directors shall control and manage the business and affairs of the Company, and shall exercise all powers of the Company and perform all acts which are not required to be exercised or performed by the shareholders. The Board of Directors may adopt such rules and regulations for the conduct of its meetings and the management of the Company as it may deem proper.
          
SECTION 3. PLACE OF MEETINGS. Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at the principal office of the Company or at such other place within or without the State of New Jersey, as the Chairman of the Board or the Board of Directors may designate.
          
SECTION 4. TELEPHONE MEETINGS. Any or all Directors may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof by means of conference telephone or any means of communication by which all persons participating in the meeting are able to hear each other.
          
SECTION 5. NOTICE OF MEETINGS. There shall be an annual meeting of the Board of Directors held without notice on the date of the annual meeting of shareholders, or as soon thereafter as convenient, at the same place as the annual meeting of shareholders unless some other location is designated by the Chairman of the Board or by the President. Regular meetings, without notice, may be held at such time and place as the Board of Directors may designate. The Chairman of the Board or the President may call any special meeting of the Board of Directors, and shall do so whenever requested in writing by at least one-third of the Directors. Notice of each special meeting shall be mailed to each Director at least four days before the date on which the meeting is to be held, or be telephoned or sent to each Director by telegraph, telex, TWX, cable, wireless or similar means of communication, or be delivered in person, not later than the day before the date on which such meeting is to be held. The Board of Directors may meet to transact business at any time and place without notice, provided that each Director shall be present, or that any Director or Directors not present shall waive notice in writing, either before or after such meeting. The attendance of any Director at a meeting without protesting prior to the conclusion of the meeting the lack of notice of such meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice by him or her. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting. Notice of an adjourned meeting need not be given if the time and place are fixed at the meeting adjourning, and if the period of adjournment does not exceed 10 days in any one adjournment.
          
SECTION 6. QUORUM. A majority of the Directors then in office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, but the Director or Directors present, if less than a quorum, may adjourn any meeting from time-to-time until such quorum shall be present. All questions coming before the Board of Directors shall be determined and decided by a majority vote of the Directors present, unless the vote of a greater number is required by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws.
          
SECTION 7. ACTION WITHOUT A MEETING. The Board of Directors may act without a meeting if, prior or subsequent to such action, each Director shall consent in writing to such action.

A new certificate may be issued without requiring any bond when, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, it is proper to do so.
          
SECTION 4. TRANSFER AGENT AND REGISTRAR. The Board of Directors may appoint one or more transfer agents and one or more registrars, and may require all certificates of capital stock to bear the signature or signatures of any of them.

The Board of Directors, by resolution, from time to time, may confer like powers upon any other person or persons.

On July 26, 2007, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for its third fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2007. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as follows:
Revenues
. We present revenue growth rates at constant foreign exchange rates. We believe that presenting revenue growth rates at constant foreign exchange rates allows investors to view the underlying operating results of BD and of its segments without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating comparisons to prior periods.
Selling and Administrative Expense
. We present selling and administrative expense, both alone and as a percentage of revenues, for the first nine months of fiscal year 2006 after excluding the impact of insurance settlements occurring during the period. These settlements caused reported selling and administrative expense to be lower than it otherwise would have been for the period, although these settlements are not considered part of ordinary operations by management. Accordingly, we believe that measures of selling and administrative expense that are adjusted for the effects of these settlements are more indicative of BD's underlying performance and assist investors in comparing BD's selling and administrative expense for the period to other periods.
Operating Income
. We present BD's operating income, both alone and as a percentage of revenues, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process research and development ("R&D") charge relating to our acquisition of Plasso Technology, Ltd ("Plasso"), and for the first nine months of fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charges relating to the Plasso acquisition and our acquisition of TriPath Imaging, Inc. ("TriPath"). We also present these measures for the first nine months of fiscal year 2006 after excluding the impact of the previously mentioned insurance settlements and the impact of the in-process R&D charge relating to the acquisition of GeneOhm Sciences Inc. ("GeneOhm"). These items affected reported operating income for the period in which they occurred, but are not considered by management to be part of ordinary operations. Accordingly, management believes that these adjusted measures of operating income are more indicative of BD's underlying performance, and also allow investors to better understand BD's comparative operating performance for the period presented.
Income Taxes/Effective Tax Rate
. We present income taxes and effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal year 2006 after excluding the impact of the previously mentioned insurance settlements. These settlements caused our reported income tax expense and effective tax rate for the period to be higher than they otherwise would have been, although these settlements are not considered part of ordinary operations by management. Management believes that these adjusted measures of income taxes are
more indicative of BD's underlying results, and also allow investors to better understand BD's comparative income tax expense and tax rate for the period.
Income from Continuing Operations
. We present BD's income from continuing operations, both alone and as a percentage of revenues, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charge relating to the Plasso acquisition, and for the first nine months of fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charges relating to the Plasso and TriPath acquisitions, respectively. We also present BD's income from continuing operations, both alone and as a percentage of revenues, for the first nine months of fiscal year 2006 after excluding the impact of insurance settlements and the in-process R&D charge relating to the GeneOhm acquisition. These items affected reported income from continuing operations for the period in which they occurred, but are not considered by management to be part of ordinary operations. Accordingly, management believes that these adjusted measures of income from continuing operations are more indicative of BD's underlying performance, and also allow investors to better understand BD's comparative income from continuing operations for the period presented.
Earnings Per Share
. We present earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charge relating to the Plasso acquisition. We also present earnings per share from continuing operations for the first nine months of fiscal year 2007 (and projected earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2007) after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charges relating to the Plasso and TriPath acquisitions, respectively. These charges caused (or will cause) reported earnings per share for the period presented to be lower than it otherwise would have been, although the charge is not considered by management to be part of ordinary operations. We believe that measures of earnings per share that are adjusted for the impact of these charges are more indicative of BD's underlying performance and also allow investors to more easily compare BD's results for these periods to other periods. We also present earnings per share from continuing operations for the first nine months of fiscal year 2006 and the full 2006 fiscal year after excluding the impact of previously mentioned insurance settlements and the in-process R&D charge relating to the GeneOhm acquisition. These items affected reported earnings per share for these periods, but are not considered by management to be part of ordinary operations. Accordingly, management believes that these adjusted measures of earnings per share are more indicative of BD's underlying performance, and also allow investors to better understand BD's comparative performance for the period presented.
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results
provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.
 
 
 
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: July 26, 2007

Reports third-quarter earnings per share from continuing operations of 95 cents, an increase of 14% from the prior year's quarter
Raises guidance for full fiscal year 2007 earnings per share from continuing operations to $3.81 to $3.83 from $3.76 to $3.80, excluding specified items
Franklin Lakes, NJ (July 26, 2007)
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported record quarterly revenues of $1.631 billion for the third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2007, representing an increase of 12 percent over the prior year period. This quarter's growth rate reflects the favorable impact on all segments from foreign currency translation, which overall is estimated to account for 3 percentage points of the increase in quarterly revenues.
"We are pleased with our strong results this quarter, with each of our three segments contributing to our growth," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "The combination of solid revenue growth and continued margin improvement is allowing us to increase our investment in innovation while at the same time driving double-digit increases in earnings. These results, along with our expectations for the remainder of fiscal 2007, have enabled us to once again increase our earnings outlook for the year."
Analysis of Third Quarter and Nine-Month Periods of Fiscal Year 2007 and 2006 Earnings

The following analysis (Table 1) of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarters of fiscal 2007 and 2006 identifies specified items that affect comparability of results between periods.

For the nine-month periods, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.86 for fiscal 2007, which exclude specified items, increased by 14 percent over comparable fiscal 2006 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.50, which exclude specified items.

Revenues outside the U.S. were $863 million, representing an increase of 13 percent over the prior year period.

On November 1, 2007, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ending September 30, 2007. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as follows:
Revenues
. We present revenue growth rates at constant foreign exchange rates. We believe that
presenting revenue growth rates at constant foreign exchange rates allows investors to view the
underlying operating results of BD and of its segments without the impact of fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating comparisons to prior periods.
Selling and Administrative Expense
. We present selling and administrative expense, both alone
and as a percentage of revenues, for fiscal year 2006 after excluding the impact of insurance
settlements occurring during the fiscal year. These settlements caused reported selling and
administrative expense to be lower than it otherwise would have been for the fiscal year, although
these settlements are not considered part of ordinary operations by management. Accordingly, we
believe that measures of selling and administrative expense that are adjusted for the effects of
these settlements are more indicative of BD's underlying performance and assist investors in
comparing BD's selling and administrative expense for the period to other periods.
Operating Income
. We present BD's operating income, both alone and as a percentage of revenues,
for fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process research and development
("R&D") charges relating to our acquisition of Plasso Technology, Ltd ("Plasso") and our acquisition of TriPath Imaging, Inc. ("TriPath"). We also present these measures for fiscal year 2006 after excluding the impact of the previously mentioned insurance settlements and the impact of the in-process R&D charge relating to the acquisition of GeneOhm Sciences, Inc. ("GeneOhm"). These items affected reported operating income for the period in which they occurred, but are not considered by management to be part of ordinary operations. Accordingly, management believes that these adjusted measures of operating income are more indicative of BD's underlying performance, and also allow investors to better understand BD's comparative operating performance for the period presented.
Income Taxes/Effective Tax Rate
. We present the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charges relating to our acquisitions of Plasso and TriPath, respectively. These items, which are not considered part of ordinary operations by management and are not tax deductible, caused our effective tax rate for the fiscal year to be higher than it otherwise would have been.
We also present income taxes and effective tax rate for fiscal year 2006 after excluding the impact of the previously mentioned insurance settlements. These settlements caused our reported income tax expense and effective tax rate for the fiscal year to be higher than they otherwise would have been, although these settlements are not considered part of ordinary operations by management. The adjusted effective tax rate we present for fiscal year 2006 also excludes the impact of the in-process R&D charge relating to our acquisition of GeneOhm. This item, which is not tax deductible, caused our effective tax rate for the fiscal year to be higher than it otherwise would have been, although this item is not considered part of ordinary operations by management.
Management believes that these adjusted measures of income taxes and effective tax rate are more indicative of BD's underlying results, and also allow investors to better understand BD's comparative income tax expense and tax rate for the fiscal year.
Income from Continuing Operations
. We present BD's income from continuing operations, both
alone and as a percentage of revenues, for fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-
process R&D charges relating to the Plasso and TriPath acquisitions, respectively. We also present
BD's income from continuing operations, both alone and as a percentage of revenues, for fiscal year 2006 after excluding the impact of the previously mentioned insurance settlements and the in-process R&D charge relating to the GeneOhm acquisition. These items affected reported income
from continuing operations for the period in which they occurred, but are not considered by
management to be part of ordinary operations. Accordingly, management believes that these adjusted measures of income from continuing operations are more indicative of BD's underlying performance, and also allow investors to better understand BD's comparative income from continuing operations for the period presented.
Earnings Per Share
. We present earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charges relating to the TriPath and Plasso acquisitions, respectively. These charges caused reported earnings per share for the fiscal year to be lower than it otherwise would have been, although these charges are not considered by management to be part of ordinary operations. We believe that a measure of earnings per share that is adjusted for the impact of these charges is more indicative of BD's underlying performance and also allows investors to more easily compare BD's results for the fiscal year to other periods.
We also present earnings per share from continuing operations for the 2006 fiscal year after excluding the impact of the previously mentioned insurance settlements and the in-process R&D charge relating to the GeneOhm acquisition. These items affected reported earnings per share for the fiscal year, but are not considered by management to be part of ordinary operations. Accordingly, management believes that this adjusted measure of earnings per share is more indicative of BD's underlying performance, and also allows investors to better understand BD's comparative performance for the fiscal year.
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.
 
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Franklin Lakes, NJ (November 1, 2007)
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported record quarterly revenues of $1.651 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2007, representing an increase of 13 percent over the prior year period. This quarter's growth rate reflects the favorable impact on all segments from foreign currency translation, which overall is estimated to account for 3 percentage points of the increase in quarterly revenues.
For the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2007, BD reported record revenues of $6.360 billion, representing an increase of 11 percent over the prior year, which reflects an overall estimated 3 percent favorable impact from foreign currency translation that affected all segments.
"We are pleased with our solid finish to another successful year during which BD exceeded its financial and operating goals," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our performance was strong across all three segments. We continue to invest in innovation while delivering double-digit earnings growth. Strong cash flow driven by operating margin expansion enables us to return value to shareholders through dividend increases and share repurchases. We are enthusiastic about our outlook for fiscal 2008."

Fourth quarter revenues in the U.S. were $790 million, representing an increase of 12 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside the U.S. were $861 million, representing an increase of 13 percent over the prior year period, and reflected an estimated 5 percent favorable impact from foreign currency translation.

The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as follows:
 
 
performance and also allow investors to more easily compare BD's results for the period to other periods.
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.

First-quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified item, increased 11% to $1.07
Raises guidance for full fiscal year 2008 earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, to a range of 11% to 13% from 10% to 12%
Franklin Lakes, NJ (January 24, 2008)
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported record quarterly revenues of $1.706 billion for the first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2007, representing an increase of 14 percent over the prior year period. This quarter's growth rate reflects the favorable impact on all segments from foreign currency translation, which overall is estimated to account for 6 percentage points of the growth.
"We are pleased with our strong start to fiscal 2008. Our BD Diagnostics and BD Biosciences segments led our revenue growth," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Disciplined expense management enables us to offset the challenges of raw material price increases and manufacturing start-up costs related to increasing capacity to meet growing demand."
Analysis of First Quarter Fiscal Year 2008 and 2007 Earnings
The following analysis (Table 1) of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarters of fiscal 2008 and 2007 identifies the specified item that affects comparability of results between periods. As illustrated, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.07 for the first fiscal quarter of 2008 increased by 11 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified item, of 96 cents for the first fiscal quarter of 2007.
(1)
Represents the effect on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of the in-process research and development charge recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 related to the TriPath acquisition.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $909 million, representing an increase of 10 percent over the prior year period. Pharmaceutical Systems and Diabetes Care products led revenue growth in the segment.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $523 million, representing an increase of 18 percent over the prior year period. Five percentage points of this growth is attributable to TriPath, which was acquired near the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2007. Sales of safety-engineered devices and molecular testing systems, including GeneOhm, also contributed to growth.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $274 million, representing an increase of 18 percent over the prior year period. Demand for research instruments as well as clinical and research reagents continued to be the primary growth drivers.
Geographic Results
First quarter revenues in the U.S. were $790 million, representing an increase of 10 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside the U.S. were $916 million, representing an increase of 17 percent over the prior year period, and reflect an estimated 11 percent favorable impact from foreign currency translation.
Fiscal 2008 Outlook for Full Year
The Company estimates that diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full fiscal year 2008 will increase approximately 11 to 13 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the 48 cents in-process research and development charge related to the TriPath and Plasso acquisitions, of $3.84 for the fiscal year 2007.

Date: February 4, 2008
 
 
 

Exhibit 3.1
          
The registered office of Becton, Dickinson and Company ("Company") shall be in the Borough of Franklin Lakes, County of Bergen, State of New Jersey or such other place within or without the State of New Jersey as the Board of Directors may designate. The Company may also establish and have such other offices within or without the State of New Jersey, as the Board of Directors may designate or its business may require.
          
SECTION 1.      PLACE OF MEETINGS. Meetings of the shareholders shall be held at the registered office of the Company in New Jersey, or at such other place, within or without the State of New Jersey, as may be designated by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting.
          
SECTION 2.A.   ANNUAL MEETINGS. The annual meeting of shareholders for the election of Directors and the transaction of such other business as may be related to the purposes set forth in the notice of the meeting shall be held at such time as may be fixed by the Board of Directors.
          
B.      SPECIAL MEETING FOR ELECTION OF DIRECTORS. If the annual meeting of shareholders is not held on the date designated, the Board of Directors may call a special meeting of the shareholders for the election of Directors and the transaction of other business.
          
C.      SPECIAL MEETINGS. Special meetings of the shareholders may be called by the Board of Directors or by the Chairman of the Board or by the President, and shall be called by the Chairman of the Board or by the President upon written request of a majority of the Directors then in office, which request shall state the time, place and purpose of the meeting.
          
D.      ADVANCE NOTICE OF NOMINATIONS AND BUSINESS TO BE TRANSACTED AT ANNUAL MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS. No business may be transacted at an annual meeting of shareholders, other than business that is either (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof), (ii) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof), or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by any shareholder of the Company (A) who is a shareholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 2.D. and on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote at such annual meeting, and (B) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.D.
          
In addition to any other applicable requirements, for nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors or for other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder, such shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the Company.
          
To be timely, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Company not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders;
provided
,
however
, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for on a date that is not within 30 days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder in order to be timely must be so received not earlier than the 120
th
day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90
th
day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above.
          
Notwithstanding anything in the first sentence of the preceding paragraph to the contrary, in the event that the number of Directors to be elected to the Board of Directors is increased and there is no notice or public disclosure by the Company naming all of the nominees for Director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least 70 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders, a shareholder's notice required by this Section 2.D. shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made.
          
To be in proper written form, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must set forth (i) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a Director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 14a-11 thereunder (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a Director if elected), (ii) as to each matter such shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (iii) the name and record address of such shareholder, (iv) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Company that are owned beneficially or of record by such shareholder, together with proof of ownership if requested by the Company, (v) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such shareholder and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with such nomination or proposal of such business by such shareholder and any material interest of such shareholder in such business, and (vi) a representation that such shareholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such business before the meeting. In addition, a shareholder seeking to
submit such business at an annual meeting shall promptly provide any other information reasonably requested by the Company.
          
No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of shareholders except business brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.D;
provided
,
however
, that, once business has been properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with such procedures, nothing in this Section 2.D. shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any shareholder of any such business. If the Chairman of an annual meeting determines that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the Chairman shall declare to the meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting and such business shall not be transacted.
          
The provisions of this Section 2.D shall not be applicable to any shareholder proposal submitted for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under Regulation 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
          
SECTION 3.      QUORUM. The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of shares representing a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at a meeting shall constitute a quorum. The shareholders present in person or by proxy at a duly organized meeting may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum. If a quorum not be present or represented at any meeting, the Chairman of the meeting or a majority of the shareholders present in person, or by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting without notice until the required voting shares shall be represented. At such adjourned meeting with the requisite amount of voting shares represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.
          
SECTION 4.      NOTICE OF MEETINGS. A written notice of each annual or special meeting of the shareholders of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board or the President or the Secretary, which shall state the time, place and purpose of such meeting, shall be delivered personally or mailed, not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days before the date of any such meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, the notice shall be directed to the shareholder at his or her address as it appears on the records of the stock transfer agent. Any shareholder, in person or by proxy, may at any time by a duly signed statement in writing to that effect, waive any statutory or other notice of any meeting, whether such statement be signed before or after such meeting.
          
SECTION 5.      VOTING. At all meetings of the shareholders, each holder of common stock having the right to vote, and present at the meeting in person or by proxy, shall be entitled to one vote for each full share of common stock of the Company entitled to vote and registered in his or her name. Each holder of preferred stock of any series shall have such voting powers, if any, as the Board of Directors shall have fixed by resolution prior to the issuance of any shares of such series. Whenever any action is to be taken by vote of the shareholders, it shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of the shareholders by the holders of shares entitled to vote, unless a greater plurality is required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation.
          
SECTION 6.      PROXIES. Any shareholder of record entitled to vote may be represented at any annual or special meeting of the shareholders by a duly appointed proxy. All proxies shall be written and properly signed, but shall require no other attestation, and shall be filed with the Secretary of the meeting before being voted.
          
SECTION 7.      ORGANIZATION. The Chairman of the Board, or in the absence or disability of the Chairman of the Board or if a vacancy exists in the office of Chairman of the Board, a director or officer designated by the Board of Directors shall act as chairman of the meeting at all meetings of the shareholders. The Secretary, or in his or her absence or disability one of the Assistant Secretaries, shall act as secretary of the meeting. In case none of the officers above designated to act as secretary of the meeting shall be present, a secretary of the meeting shall be chosen by the Board of Directors.
          
SECTION 8.      ORDER OF BUSINESS. The order of business at all meetings of the shareholders shall be as determined by the Chairman of the meeting, but the order of business to be followed at any meeting at which a quorum is present may be changed by a vote of the shareholders.
          
SECTION 9.      RECORD DATE FOR ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT. In order that the Company may determine the shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Company by delivery to its registered office in New Jersey, its principal place of business or to any officer or agent of the Company having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Company's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
Nothing in this Article II, Section 9 shall require the Board of Directors to take any action with respect to any proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought other than to fix a record date as provided for herein; and the fixing of any such record date shall not be deemed to be an action taken by the Board of Directors with respect to any such proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought for any other purpose.
          
SECTION 10.      INSPECTORS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by Article II, Section 9, to the Company of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Company shall engage nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Company that the consents delivered to the Company in accordance with Article II, Section 9 represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any shareholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
          
SECTION 11.      EFFECTIVENESS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each shareholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with Article II, Section 9, a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to the Company in the manner prescribed in Article II, Section 9.
          
SECTION 1.      QUALIFICATIONS. Each Director shall be at least 21 years of age and shall be elected in the manner provided by these By-Laws.
          
SECTION 2.      DUTIES AND POWERS. The Board of Directors shall control and manage the business and affairs of the Company, and shall exercise all powers of the Company and perform all acts which are not required to be exercised or performed by the shareholders. The Board of Directors may adopt such rules and regulations for the conduct of its meetings and the management of the Company as it may deem proper.
          
SECTION 3.      PLACE OF MEETINGS. Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at the principal office of the Company or at such other place within or without the State of New Jersey, as the Chairman of the Board or the Board of Directors may designate.
          
SECTION 4.      TELEPHONE MEETINGS. Any or all Directors may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof by means of conference telephone or any means of communication by which all persons participating in the meeting are able to hear each other.
          
SECTION 5.      NOTICE OF MEETINGS. There shall be an annual meeting of the Board of Directors held without notice on the date of the annual meeting of shareholders, or as soon thereafter as convenient, at the same place as the annual meeting
of shareholders unless some other location is designated by the Chairman of the Board or by the President. Regular meetings, without notice, may be held at such time and place as the Board of Directors may designate. The Chairman of the Board or the President may call any special meeting of the Board of Directors, and shall do so whenever requested in writing by at least one-third of the Directors. Notice of each special meeting shall be mailed to each Director at least four days before the date on which the meeting is to be held, or be telephoned or sent to each Director by telegraph, telex, TWX, cable, wireless or similar means of communication, or be delivered in person, not later than the day before the date on which such meeting is to be held.

(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the date of any A Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such A Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such A Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such
corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to A Advances comprising such A Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate.

The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., New York Branch, as Syndication Agent
Citicorp USA, Inc., as Administrative Agent
399 Park Avenue
New York, New York 10043
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          
I am General Counsel of Becton, Dickinson and Company (the "
Borrower
") and with attorneys in my department have acted as counsel to the Borrower in connection with the Amended and Restated Five Year Credit Agreement (the "
Credit Agreement
") dated as of December 1, 2006, among the Borrower, the lenders named therein, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., New York Branch, as syndication agent, and Citicorp USA, Inc., as Administrative Agent, providing for loans to be made by said lenders to the Borrower in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding $1,000,000,000. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used in this opinion letter as defined therein. This opinion letter is being delivered pursuant to Section 3.01(e) of the Credit Agreement.
          
In rendering the opinion expressed below, I, or attorneys under my supervision, have examined the following agreements, instruments and other documents:
          
In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity with authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. When relevant facts were not independently established, we have relied upon certificates of governmental officials and appropriate representatives of the Borrower and upon representations made in or pursuant to the Credit Agreement.
          
In rendering the opinions expressed below, I have assumed, with respect to all of the documents referred to in this opinion letter, that (except, to the extent set forth in the opinions expressed below, as to the Borrower):
          
Based upon and subject to the foregoing and subject also to the comments and qualifications set forth below, and having considered such questions of law as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below, I am of the opinion that:
     
1. The Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of New Jersey.
     
2. The Borrower has all requisite corporate power to execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations and to incur liabilities under, the Credit Documents.
     
3. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of, and the incurrence by the Borrower of liabilities under, each Credit Document have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Borrower.
     
4. Each Credit Document has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower.
     
5. Each Credit Document constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or transfer or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally and except as the enforceability of the Credit Documents is subject to the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including, without limitation, (a) the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (b) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.
     
6. No authorization, approval or consent of, and no filing or registration with, any governmental or regulatory authority or agency of the United States of America or the State of New York is required on the part of the Borrower for the execution, delivery or performance by the Borrower of, or for the incurrence by the Borrower of any liabilities under, any of the Credit Documents.
     
7. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of, and the consummation by the Borrower of the transactions contemplated by, the Credit Documents do not (a) violate any provision of the charter or by-laws of the Borrower,
(b) violate any applicable law, rule or regulation of the United States of America, the State of New Jersey or the State of New York, (c) violate any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental authority or agency or any arbitral award applicable to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of which I have knowledge or (d) result in a breach of, constitute a default under, require any consent under, or result in the acceleration or required prepayment of any indebtedness pursuant to the terms of, any agreement or instrument of which I have knowledge to which the Borrower and its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound or to which any of them is subject, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any Property of the Borrower pursuant to the terms of any such agreement or instrument.
     
8. There is no pending (or, to my knowledge, threatened) action or proceeding against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator, in which there is likely to be an adverse decision that (i) would have a material adverse effect on the business, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) purports to affect the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any Note.
     
The foregoing opinions are subject to the following comments and qualifications:
     
(A) The enforceability of Section 8.04(b) of the Credit Agreement may be limited by laws limiting the enforceability of provisions exculpating or exempting a party from, or requiring indemnification of a party for, its own action or inaction.
     
(B) The enforceability of provisions in the Credit Documents to the effect that terms may not be waived or modified except in writing may be limited under certain circumstances.
     
(C) I express no opinion as to (i) the effect of the laws of any jurisdiction in which any Lender is located that limit the interest, fees or other charges such Lender may impose, (ii) Section 8.05 of the Credit Agreement, (iii) Section 7.05 of the Credit Agreement, (iv) the second sentence of Section 8.08 of the Credit Agreement, insofar as such sentence relates to the subject matter jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to adjudicate any controversy related to the Credit Documents, (v) the third sentence of Section 8.08 of the Credit Agreement and (vi) Section 8.09 of the Credit Agreement.
          
The foregoing opinions are limited to matters involving the Federal laws of the United States, the law of the State of New Jersey and the law of the State of New York, and I do not express any opinion as to the laws of any other jurisdiction.
          
In delivering the foregoing opinion, I have, with your approval, relied as to all matters governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey upon the opinion of even date herewith of Gary DeFazio, Esq., Associate General Counsel of the Borrower, a copy of which has been furnished to you. In my opinion, such opinion is satisfactory in form and scope and you are justified in relying thereon.
 
          
At the request of the Borrower, this opinion letter is, pursuant to Section 3.01(e) of the Credit Agreement, provided to you by me in my capacity as General Counsel of the Borrower and may not be relied upon by any Person for any purpose other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement without, in each instance, my prior written consent.
EXHIBIT F
To the Initial Lenders party to the
      Credit Agreement referred to
      below and to Citicorp USA, Inc.,
      as Administrative Agent
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          
We have acted as counsel to Citicorp USA, Inc., as Administrative Agent (the "
Agent
"), in connection with the Amended and Restated Five Year Credit Agreement, dated as of December 1, 2006 (the "
Credit Agreement
"), among Becton, Dickinson and Company, a New Jersey corporation (the "
Borrower
"), and each of you. Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined.
          
In that connection, we have reviewed originals or copies of the following documents:
          
(a)
The Credit Agreement.
          
(b)
The Notes executed by the Borrower and delivered on the date hereof.
The documents described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) are collectively referred to herein as the "
Opinion Documents
."
          
We have also reviewed originals or copies of such other agreements and documents as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinion expressed below.
          
In our review of the Opinion Documents and other documents, we have assumed:
          
(1)      The Borrower is an entity duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization.
          
(2)      The Borrower has full power to execute, deliver and perform, and has duly executed and delivered, the Opinion Documents.
          
(3)      The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Opinion Documents have been duly authorized by all necessary action (corporate or otherwise) and do not:
          
(a) contravene its certificate or articles of incorporation, by-laws or other organizational documents;
          
(b) except with respect to Generally Applicable Law, violate any law, rule or regulation applicable to it; or
          
(c) result in any conflict with or breach of any agreement or document binding on it of which any addressee hereof has knowledge, has received notice or has reason to know.
          
(4)      Except with respect to Generally Applicable Law, no authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body or (to the extent the same is required under any agreement or document binding on it of which an addressee hereof has knowledge, has received notice or has reason to know) any other third party is required for the due execution, delivery or performance by the Borrower of any Opinion Document or, if any such authorization, approval, action, notice or filing is required, it has been duly obtained, taken, given or made and is in full force and effect.
          
We have not independently established the validity of the foregoing assumptions.
          
"
Generally Applicable Law
" means the federal law of the United States of America, and the law of the State of New York (including the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder or pursuant thereto), that a New York lawyer exercising customary professional diligence would reasonably be expected to recognize as being applicable to the Borrower, the Opinion Documents or the transactions governed by the Opinion Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing definition of Generally Applicable Law, the term "Generally Applicable Law" does not include any law, rule or regulation that is applicable to the Borrower, the Opinion Documents or such transactions solely because such law, rule or regulation is part of a regulatory regime applicable to the specific assets or business of any party to any of the Opinion Documents or any of its affiliates.
          
Based upon the foregoing and upon such other investigation as we have deemed necessary and subject to the qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that each Opinion Document is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms.
          
Our opinion expressed above is subject to the following qualifications:
          
(a) Our opinion is subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally (including without limitation all laws relating to fraudulent transfers).
          
(b) Our opinion is subject to the effect of general principles of equity, including without limitation concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
          
(c) We express no opinion with respect to the enforceability of indemnification provisions, or of release or exculpation provisions, contained in the Opinion Documents to the extent that enforcement thereof is contrary to public policy regarding the indemnification against or release or exculpation of criminal violations, intentional harm or violations of securities laws.
          
(d) Our opinion is limited to Generally Applicable Law.
          
A copy of this opinion letter may be delivered by any of you to any person that becomes a Lender in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Any such person may rely on the opinions expressed above as if this opinion letter were addressed and delivered to such person on the date hereof.
          
This opinion letter is rendered to you in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Opinion Documents. This opinion letter may not be relied upon by you or any person entitled to rely on this opinion pursuant to the preceding paragraph for any other purpose without our prior written consent.
          
This opinion letter speaks only as of the date hereof. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to advise you of any development or circumstance of any kind, including any change of law or fact, that may occur after the date of this opinion letter that might affect the opinions expressed herein.

ITEM 2.02      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
On April 23, 2008, Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD) issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2008. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as follows:
Revenues
. We present international and total company revenue growth rates at constant foreign exchange
rates. We believe that presenting revenue growth rates at constant foreign exchange rates allows investors
to view the underlying operating results of BD and of its segments without the impact of fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating comparisons to prior periods.
Operating Income
. We present BD's operating income, both alone and as a percentage of revenues, for the
first six months of fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process research and development
("R&D") charge relating to our acquisition of TriPath Imaging, Inc. ("TriPath"). This charge affected
reported operating income for the period, but is not considered by management to be part of ordinary
operations. Accordingly, management believes that these adjusted measures of operating income are more
indicative of BD's underlying performance, and allow investors to better understand BD's comparative
operating performance for the period.
Effective Tax Rate
. We present the effective tax rate for the first six months of fiscal year 2007 after
excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charge relating to our acquisition of TriPath. This charge,
which is not considered part of ordinary operations by management and is not tax deductible, caused our
effective tax rate for the fiscal year to be higher than it otherwise would have been. Management believes
that this adjusted measure of our effective tax rate is more indicative of BD's underlying results, and allows
investors to better understand BD's comparative effective tax rate for the period.
Income from Continuing Operations
. We present BD's income from continuing operations, both alone and
as a percentage of revenues, for the first six months of fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-
process R&D charge relating to the TriPath acquisition. This item affected reported income from
continuing operations for the period, but is not considered by management to be part of ordinary operations.
Accordingly, management believes that these adjusted measures of income from continuing operations are more indicative of BD's underlying performance, and allow investors to better understand BD's comparative income from continuing operations for the period.
Earnings Per Share
. We present earnings per share from continuing operations for the first six months of
fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charge relating to the TriPath acquisition,
and for the 2007 fiscal year after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charges relating to the
TriPath acquisition and our acquisition of Plasso Technology, Ltd. These charges caused reported earnings
per share for such periods to be lower than they otherwise would have been, although these charges are not
considered by management to be part of ordinary operations. We believe that measures of earnings per
share that are adjusted for the impact of these charges is more indicative of BD's underlying performance
and allow investors to more easily compare BD's results for the period to other periods.
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.
 
 
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

BD ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR SECOND FISCAL QUARTER
 
Earnings per share from continuing operations increased 18% to $1.09;
Company raises earnings guidance for full fiscal year
 
Franklin Lakes, NJ (April 23, 2008)
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported record quarterly revenues of $1.747 billion for the second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2008, representing an increase of 11 percent over the prior year period. This quarter's revenue growth rate reflects the favorable impact on all segments from foreign currency translation, which overall is estimated to account for 5 percentage points of the increase in quarterly revenues.
 
"We are pleased with our strong results, which were once again driven by solid company-wide revenue growth and disciplined spending controls that more than offset the headwind we have been facing as a result of increasing raw material costs," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Accordingly, we are increasing our earnings guidance for the full year."
 
Second Quarter and Six-Month Period of Fiscal Year 2008 and 2007 Earnings
Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.09 for the second quarter increased by 18 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 92 cents for the second fiscal quarter of 2007. For the six-month period ending March 31, 2008, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.16. For the six-month period ending March 31, 2007, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.44. The following analysis (Table 1) of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the six-month periods ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 identifies the specified item that affects comparability of results between periods. As illustrated, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.16 for fiscal 2008 increased by 14 percent over comparable fiscal 2007 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.89, which exclude the specified item.

For the six-month period ended March 31, 2008, the BD Medical segment reported 10 percent revenue growth. Pharmaceutical Systems and Diabetes Care products led revenue growth in the segment.
 
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $531 million, representing an increase of 12 percent from the prior year's quarter. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2008, the BD Diagnostics segment reported 15 percent revenue growth. Sales of safety-engineered devices, TriPath products, and molecular testing systems, including GeneOhm, contributed to revenue growth.
 
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $294 million, representing an increase of 14 percent from the prior year's quarter. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2008, the BD Biosciences segment reported 16 percent revenue growth. Demand for research instruments as well as clinical and research reagents continued to be the primary growth drivers.
 
Geographic Results
Second quarter revenues in the U.S. were $784 million, representing an increase of 4 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside the U.S. were $963 million, representing an increase of 17 percent over the prior year period, with approximately 10 percentage points of the increase resulting from the favorable impact of foreign currency translation.
 
For the six-month period ended March 31, 2008, revenues in the U.S. were $1.574 billion, representing an increase of 7 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $1.879 billion, representing an increase of 17 percent over the prior year period, with approximately 10 percentage points of the increase resulting from the favorable impact from foreign currency translation.
 
Fiscal 2008 Outlook for Full Year
 
The Company raised its guidance for full fiscal year 2008 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to approximately 13 to 14 percent from approximately 11 to 13 percent over adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $3.84 for the full fiscal year 2007. Reported
 
 
 
 
 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full fiscal year 2007 were $3.36, which included 48 cents for in-process research and development charges related to the TriPath and Plasso acquisitions. Excluding these charges, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full fiscal year 2007 were $3.84.

ITEM 2.02      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
On July 24, 2008, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2008. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as follows:
Revenues
. We present international and total company revenue growth rates at constant foreign exchange rates. We believe that presenting revenue growth rates at constant foreign exchange rates allows investors to view the underlying operating results of BD and of its segments without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating comparisons to prior periods.
Operating Income
. We present BD's operating income, both alone and as a percentage of revenues, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process research and development ("R&D") charge relating to our acquisition of Plasso Technology, Ltd. ("Plasso"). We also present BD's operating income, both alone and as a percentage of revenues, for the first nine months of fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charges relating to our acquisition of Plasso and our acquisition of TriPath Imaging, Inc. ("TriPath"). These charges affected reported operating income for the periods presented, but are not considered by management to be part of ordinary operations. Accordingly, management believes that these adjusted measures of operating income are more indicative of BD's underlying performance, and allow investors to better understand BD's comparative operating performance for the periods presented.
Effective Tax Rate
. We present BD's effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charges relating to our acquisition of Plasso. We also present BD's effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charges relating to our acquisition of TriPath and Plasso. These charges, which are not considered part of ordinary operations by management and are not tax deductible, caused our effective tax rate for such periods to be higher than it otherwise would have been. Management believes that these adjusted measures of our effective tax rate are more indicative of BD's underlying results, and allow investors to better understand BD's comparative effective tax rate for such periods.
Income from Continuing Operations
. We present BD's income from continuing operations, both alone and as a percentage of revenues, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charge relating to our acquisition of Plasso. We also present BD's income from continuing operations, both alone and as a percentage of revenues, for the first nine months of fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charges relating to our acquisition of TriPath and Plasso. These charges affected reported income from continuing operations for the periods presented, but are not considered by management to be part of ordinary operations. Accordingly, management believes that these adjusted measures of income from continuing operations are more indicative of BD's underlying performance, and allow investors to better understand BD's comparative income from continuing operations for such periods.
Earnings Per Share
. We present BD's earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charge relating to our acquisition of Plasso. We also present earnings per share from continuing operations for the first nine months of fiscal year 2007 and for the full 2007 fiscal year after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charges relating to our acquisition of TriPath and Plasso. These charges caused reported earnings per share for such periods to be lower than they otherwise would have been, although these charges are not considered by management to be part of ordinary operations. We believe that measures of earnings per share that are adjusted for the impact of these charges are more indicative of BD's underlying performance and allow investors to more easily compare BD's results for the periods presented to other periods.
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.

News Release
 
Franklin Lakes, NJ (July 24, 2008)
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported record quarterly revenues of $1.868 billion for the third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2008, representing an increase of 14.5 percent over the prior year period. This quarter's revenue growth rate reflects the favorable impact on all segments from foreign currency translation, which overall is estimated to account for nearly 7 percentage points of the increase in quarterly revenues.
"We are pleased that all segments and regions, particularly Europe and Asia, contributed to solid revenue growth," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We are also pleased with our operating results, which in part, have enabled us to raise our earnings guidance once again despite continued pressure from increasing raw material costs."
Analyses of Third Quarter and Nine-Month Periods of Fiscal Year 2008 and 2007 Earnings
Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.18 for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and 95 cents for the third quarter of fiscal 2007. For the nine-month period ending June 30, 2008, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $3.34. For the nine-
month period ending June 30, 2007, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.38.
The following analysis (Table 1) of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the three-month and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, identifies the specified items that affect comparability of results between periods. As illustrated, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.18 for the third fiscal quarter of 2008 increased by 20 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the specified item, of 98 cents for the third fiscal quarter of 2007. For the nine-month periods, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $3.34 for fiscal 2008 increased by 17 percent over comparable fiscal 2007 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.86, which exclude the specified items.
 
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $1.016 billion, representing an
increase of 15 percent from the prior year period. Pharmaceutical Systems and Diabetes Care products
led revenue growth in the segment. For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2008, the BD Medical segment reported 12 percent revenue growth.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $553 million, representing an increase of 13 percent from the prior year's quarter. Sales of safety-engineered devices, TriPath products and infectious disease testing systems contributed to revenue growth.

In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $298 million, representing an increase of 16 percent from the prior year's quarter. Demand for clinical and research instruments and reagents were the primary growth drivers. For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2008, the BD Biosciences segment reported 16 percent revenue growth.
Geographic Results
Third quarter revenues in the U.S. were $798 million, representing an increase of 4 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside the U.S. were $1.069 billion, representing an increase of 24 percent over the prior year period, with approximately 13 percentage points of the increase resulting from the favorable impact of foreign currency translation.
For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2008, revenues in the U.S. were $2.372 billion, representing an increase of 6 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $2.948 billion, representing an increase of 20 percent over the prior year period, with approximately 11 percentage points of the increase resulting from the favorable impact from foreign currency translation.
Fiscal 2008 Outlook for Full Year
The Company raised its guidance for full fiscal year 2008 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to approximately 16 percent from approximately 13 to 14 percent over adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $3.84 for the full fiscal year 2007. Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full fiscal year 2007 were $3.36, which included 48 cents for in-process research and development charges related to the TriPath and Plasso acquisitions. Excluding these charges, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations
for the full fiscal year 2007 were $3.84.

OTHER EVENTS.
     In (Case Number: C 04-02123 WDA, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California)), on August 8, 2008, the jury ruled in favor of Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") and determined that Abbott Laboratories' patent is not valid.
Therasense, Inc. and Abbott Laboratories v. Nova Biomedical Corporation and Becton, Dickinson and Company
This was the last of four patents asserted by the plaintiffs against BD relating to BD's discontinued blood glucose monitoring business. The Court had previously ruled in BD's favor
regarding the other three patents asserted by Therasense and Abbott Laboratories in this case. We anticipate that the plaintiffs will appeal the judgment in this case.

If a quorum not be present or represented at any meeting, the Chairman of the meeting or a majority of the shareholders present in person, or by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting without notice until the required voting shares shall be represented. At such adjourned meeting with the requisite amount of voting shares represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.
        
SECTION 4.
NOTICE OF MEETINGS. A written notice of each annual or special meeting of the shareholders of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board or the President or the Secretary, which shall state the time, place and purpose of such meeting, shall be delivered personally or mailed, not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days before the date of any such meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, the notice shall be directed to the shareholder at his or her address as it appears on the records of the stock transfer agent. Any shareholder, in person or by proxy, may at any time by a duly signed statement in writing to that effect, waive any statutory or other notice of any meeting, whether such statement be signed before or after such meeting.
        
SECTION 5.
VOTING. At all meetings of the shareholders, each holder of common stock having the right to vote, and present at the meeting in person or by proxy, shall be entitled to one vote for each full share of common stock of the Company entitled to vote and registered in his or her name. Each holder of preferred stock of any series shall have such voting powers, if any, as the Board of Directors shall have fixed by resolution prior to the issuance of any shares of such series. Whenever any action is to be taken by vote of the shareholders, other than the election of Directors, it shall be authorized by a
 
 
majority of the votes cast at a meeting of the shareholders by the holders of shares entitled to vote, unless a greater plurality is required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation.
        
SECTION 6.
PROXIES. Any shareholder of record entitled to vote may be represented at any annual or special meeting of the shareholders by a duly appointed proxy. All proxies shall be written and properly signed, but shall require no other attestation, and shall be filed with the Secretary of the meeting before being voted.
       
SECTION 7.
ORGANIZATION. The Chairman of the Board, or in the absence or disability of the Chairman of the Board or if a vacancy exists in the office of Chairman of the Board, a director or officer designated by the Board of Directors shall act as chairman of the meeting at all meetings of the shareholders. The Secretary, or in his or her absence or disability one of the Assistant Secretaries, shall act as secretary of the meeting. In case none of the officers above designated to act as secretary of the meeting shall be present, a secretary of the meeting shall be chosen by the Board of Directors.
        
SECTION 8.
ORDER OF BUSINESS. The order of business at all meetings of the shareholders shall be as determined by the chairman of the meeting, but the order of business to be followed at any meeting at which a quorum is present may be changed by a vote of the shareholders.
        
SECTION 9.
RECORD DATE FOR ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT. In order that the Company may determine the shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Company by delivery to its registered office in New Jersey, its principal place of business or to any officer or agent of the Company having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Company's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
Nothing in this Article II, Section 9 shall require the Board of Directors to take any action with respect to any proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought other than to fix a record date as provided for herein; and the fixing of any such record date shall
 
5
 
 
not be deemed to be an action taken by the Board of Directors with respect to any such proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought for any other purpose.
SECTION 10.        INSPECTORS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by Article II, Section 9, to the Company of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Company shall engage nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Company that the consents delivered to the Company in accordance with Article II, Section 9 represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any shareholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
SECTION 11.        EFFECTIVENESS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each shareholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with Article II, Section 9, a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to the Company in the manner prescribed in Article II, Section 9.
 
ARTICLE III
Directors
        
SECTION 1.
QUALIFICATIONS. Each Director shall be at least 21 years of age and shall be elected in the manner provided by the Certificate of Incorporation and these By-Laws.
        
SECTION 2.
DUTIES AND POWERS. The Board of Directors shall control and manage the business and affairs of the Company, and shall exercise all powers of the Company and perform all acts which are not required to be exercised or performed by the shareholders. The Board of Directors may adopt such rules and regulations for the conduct of its meetings and the management of the Company as it may deem proper.
        
SECTION 3.
PLACE OF MEETINGS. Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at the principal office of the Company or at such other place within or without the State of New Jersey, as the Chairman of the Board or the Board of Directors may designate.
        
SECTION 4.
TELEPHONE MEETINGS. Any or all Directors may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof by means of conference telephone or any means of communication by which all persons participating in the meeting are able to hear each other.

SECTION 5.
NOTICE OF MEETINGS. There shall be an annual meeting of the Board of Directors held without notice on the date of the annual meeting of shareholders, or as soon thereafter as convenient, at the same place as the annual meeting of shareholders unless some other location is designated by the Chairman of the Board or by the President. Regular meetings, without notice, may be held at such time and place as the Board of Directors may designate. The Chairman of the Board or the President may call any special meeting of the Board of Directors, and shall do so whenever requested in writing by at least one-third of the Directors. Notice of each special meeting shall be mailed to each Director at least four days before the date on which the meeting is to be held, or be telephoned or sent to each Director by fax, e-mail, telegraph, telex, TWX, cable, wireless or similar means of electronic communication, or be delivered in person, not later than the day before the date on which such meeting is to be held. The Board of Directors may meet to transact business at any time and place without notice, provided that each Director shall be present, or that any Director or Directors not present shall waive notice in writing, either before or after such meeting. The attendance of any Director at a meeting without protesting prior to the conclusion of the meeting the lack of notice of such meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice by him or her. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting. Notice of an adjourned meeting need not be given if the time and place are fixed at the meeting adjourning, and if the period of adjournment does not exceed 10 days in any one adjournment.
       
SECTION 6.
QUORUM. A majority of the Directors then in office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, but the Director or Directors present, if less than a quorum, may adjourn any meeting from time-to-time until such quorum shall be present. All questions coming before the Board of Directors shall be determined and decided by a majority vote of the Directors present, unless the vote of a greater number is required by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws.
        
SECTION 7.
ACTION WITHOUT A MEETING. The Board of Directors may act without a meeting if, prior or subsequent to such action, each Director shall consent in writing to such action. Such written consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board of Directors.
        
SECTION 8.
COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS. The Board of Directors may, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Directors then in office, fix reasonable fees or compensation of the Directors for services to the Company, including attendance at meetings of the Board of Directors or committees thereof. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to preclude any Director from serving the Company in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. Each Director shall be entitled to receive reimbursement for reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of his or her duties.

Exhibit 10(c)
PURPOSE
     The purpose of the Performance Incentive Plan (the "Plan") is to provide annual incentive payments to management for their contribution to the Company's successful financial performance and the accomplishment of strategic objectives.
      NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS PLAN TO THE CONTRARY, THE PAYMENT OF ANNUAL INCENTIVES, IF ANY, IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE COMMITTEE, EXCEPT THAT PAYMENT IN EXCESS OF THE PLAN GUIDELINES WILL NOT BE MADE. NO EMPLOYEE HAS ANY VESTED RIGHT TO ANY SUCH PAYMENT.
PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE COMMITTEE
      The Performance Incentive Committee will be responsible for administering this Plan. The Performance Incentive Committee will consist of no less than three persons, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and such other senior executives as are designated from time to time by the President and Chief Executive Officer.
ELIGIBILITY
      Participation in any particular fiscal year is restricted to employees of the Company and its worldwide subsidiaries in exempt (or management) Job Group 4 and above positions (other than those covered under certain non-United States incentive plans or sales incentive plans) and other key management positions as may be approved by the Performance Incentive Committee. Current employees promoted to, and persons newly hired to, eligible positions during a particular fiscal year may be considered for a pro-rata bonus. Persons employed by companies acquired by the Company which have pre-existing executive incentive, profit sharing or similar programs will not participate in this Plan until and unless those plans are superseded by this Plan.
PARTICIPATION LEVELS
      Plan targets for eligible employees are determined based upon base salary or title and reporting relationships of the participant and the scope and responsibilities of the position. Targets may range from 3% to 120% of base salary.
INCENTIVE CALCULATION
      Incentive payments shall be made under the Plan based upon total company, business unit and individual performance, as measured against certain financial and strategic criteria and targets established from time to time by the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee").
     
Incentive payments made to a member of the Executive Group shall, if the Compensation Committee intends that such payment should constitute "qualified performance-based compensation" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), be made in accordance with a pre-established formula, such that such payment is subject to the achievement during a performance period or periods, as determined by the Compensation Committee, of a level or levels, as determined by the Compensation Committee, of one or more of the following performance measures: (i) Return on Net Assets, (ii) Revenue Growth, (iii) Return on Common Equity, (iv) Total Shareholder Return, (v) Earnings Per Share, (vi) Net Revenue Per Employee, (vii) Market Share, (viii) Return on Invested Capital, or (ix) Net Income. Any such award of performance-based compensation granted to a member of the Executive Group pursuant to any such pre-established formula with respect to a fiscal year (a "Performance Award") shall not exceed $3,000,000.
     For purposes of this Plan:
     
"Earnings Per Share"
shall mean earnings per share calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
     
"Executive Group" shall mean every person who is expected by the Committee to be both (i) a "covered employee" as defined in Section 162(m) of the Code as of the end of the taxable year in which payment of the Award may be deducted by the Company, and (ii) the recipient of compensation of more than $1,000,000 for that taxable year.
     
"Market Share" shall mean the percent of sales of the total available market in an industry, product line or product attained by the Company or one of its business units during a time period.
     
"Net Income" shall mean net income calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
     
"Net Revenue Per Employee" in a period shall mean net revenue divided by the average number of employees of the Company, with average defined as the sum of the number of employees at the beginning and ending of the period divided by two.
     
"Return On Common Equity" for a period shall mean net income less preferred stock dividends divided by total shareholders' equity, less amounts, if any, attributable to preferred stock.
     
"Return on Invested Capital" for a period shall mean earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization divided by the difference of total assets less non-interest bearing current liabilities.
     
"Return On Net Assets" for a period shall mean net income less preferred stock dividends divided by the difference of average total assets less average non-debt liabilities, with average defined as the sum of assets or liabilities at the beginning and ending of the period divided by two.
     
"Revenue Growth" shall mean the percentage change in revenue (as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 6, published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board) from one period to another.
     
"Total Shareholder Return
"
shall mean the sum of the appreciation in the Company's stock price and dividends paid on the common stock of the Company over a given period of time.
     
The Compensation Committee or Board may not increase the amount of any Performance Award, or adjust the formula during the year, except to make adjustments for business dispositions or acquisitions, using adjustment factors that are specified in the terms of the Performance Award. The Compensation Committee reserves the right, however, in its discretion to make incentive awards to members of the Executive Group other than Performance Awards.
POOL FACTOR SCALES AND MULTIPLIERS
      Funding levels for incentive payments shall be determined based on company performance as measured against the performance targets in accordance with the formula established on an annual basis by the Compensation Committee. Funding levels are adjusted both upwards (for performance above target, up to a maximum score of 150% of target) and downwards (for performance below target).
DETERMINATION OF INCENTIVE POOLS
     (a) Theoretical Incentive
     On or about October 15
th
following the close of each fiscal year, business unit heads and corporate officers will be provided with a list of approved participants for their unit, region or function for whom that unit, region or function has, during the course of the prior fiscal year, accrued a hypothetical incentive pool at 100% of target.
     (b) Performance Ratings
     On or about October 25
th
following the close of each fiscal year, the Performance Incentive Committee will determine the final unit, region, function and company performance ratings used to determine incentive factors for the fiscal year. The incentive pool for a unit, region or function is determined by applying the incentive factors determined according to the methodology approved by the Compensation and Benefits Committee to the hypothetical accrued incentive pool.
INCENTIVE PAYMENT FACTORS
     Incentive payment factors will be established as a composite of total company and business unit performance ratings.
     (a) Communication
     The operating unit and corporate ratings will be communicated to business unit heads and corporate functions by the President and Chief Executive Officer.
     (b) Incentive Payment Recommendations
     The Business Unit Heads and Corporate Officers will apply the final unit factors to the individual incentive targets to develop the recommended incentive amounts. They will have discretion to recommend incentives that differ from these amounts; provided that no individual may receive an incentive payment in excess of 200% of the amount derived after the application of the unit factors without the further approval of the Compensation Committee; and provided further that no member of the Executive Group may receive an incentive payment in excess of the amount calculated pursuant to the pre-established formula established by the Compensation and Benefits Committee, to the extent such payment is intended to constitute "qualified performance-based compensation" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code.
FINAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL
     The recommendations for all incentive payments will be reviewed and approved by the business unit heads and executive officers, and Chief Executive Officer for their respective areas of responsibility. In the case of executive officers and other members of the BD Leadership Team that report to the Chief Executive Officer, recommendations will be subject to final review and approval by the Compensation Committee (and, in the case of the Chief Executive Officer, the Board of Directors).
     (a) Maximum Payout Guideline
     Total incentive awards to executive officers may not, barring special circumstances, exceed 3% of the Company's after-tax net income, as reported, for the fiscal year.
     (b) Payment
     Incentives will normally be paid in January of the calendar year following the year in which they are awarded. Except in cases of death, disability or retirement, no incentive payments will be made to individuals who are not active employees on the final day of the fiscal year. Employees who are terminated for cause prior to the distribution date will forfeit their incentives.
     Incentives awarded to any employee who dies prior to the distribution date may be made, at the discretion of management, to the survivors of the employee.
     (c) Exceptions
     Any recommendations for exceptions to the provisions of the Plan must be submitted to the Performance Incentive Committee for review and are subject to final approval by the Chief Executive Officer. Any exceptions applicable to executive officers are further subject to approval by the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors and the terms of this Plan.
RECOVERY OF INCENTIVE PAYMENTS
Any incentive payment approved under this Plan after May 20, 2008 shall be subject to the terms of the Company's Policy Regarding the Recovery of Compensation, effective May 20, 2008, as the same may be subsequently amended (the "Policy");
provided
, that no amendment to the Policy shall adversely affect the rights of an employee with respect to any incentive payment that is approved in accordance with this Plan prior to such amendment.

On November 5, 2008, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ending September 30, 2008. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as follows:
Revenues
. We present international and total company revenue growth rates at constant foreign exchange
rates. We believe that presenting revenue growth rates at constant foreign exchange rates allows investors
to view the underlying operating results of BD and of its segments without the impact of fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating comparisons to prior periods.
Operating Income
. We present BD's operating income, both alone and as a percentage of revenues, for
fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process research and development ("R&D") charges
relating to our acquisitions of Plasso Technology, Ltd. ("Plasso") and TriPath Imaging, Inc. ("TriPath"). These charges affected reported operating income for the 2007 fiscal year, but are not considered by
management to be part of ordinary operations. Accordingly, management believes that these adjusted
measures of operating income are more indicative of BD's underlying performance for the 2007 fiscal year,
and allow investors to more easily compare BD's performance for the period to other periods.
Effective Tax Rate
. We present BD's effective tax rate for the 2007 fiscal year after excluding the impact
of the in-process R&D charges relating to our acquisition of TriPath and Plasso. These charges, which are
not considered part of ordinary operations by management and are not tax deductible, caused our effective
tax rate for the 2007 fiscal year to be higher than it otherwise would have been. Management believes that
this adjusted measure of our effective tax rate is more indicative of BD's underlying results, and allows
investors to more easily compare BD's effective tax rate for the 2007 fiscal year to other periods.
Income from Continuing Operations
. We present BD's income from continuing operations, both alone and
as a percentage of revenues, for fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charges
relating to our acquisition of TriPath and Plasso. These charges affected reported income from continuing
operations for the 2007 fiscal year, but are not considered by management to be part of ordinary operations.
Accordingly, management believes that these adjusted measures of income from continuing operations are
more indicative of BD's underlying performance for the 2007 fiscal year, and allow investors to more
easily compare BD's performance for the period to other periods.
Earnings Per Share
. We present BD's earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2007
after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charges relating to our acquisition of TriPath and Plasso. These charges caused reported earnings per share for the 2007 fiscal year to be lower than it otherwise
would have been, although these charges are not considered by management to be part of ordinary
operations. We believe that a measure of earnings per share that is adjusted for the impact of these charges
is more indicative of BD's underlying performance and allows investors to more easily compare BD's
results for the 2007 fiscal year to other periods.
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.
 
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Franklin Lakes, NJ (November 5, 2008)
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported quarterly revenues of $1.836 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2008, representing an increase of 11 percent over the prior year period. This quarter's growth rate reflects the favorable impact on all segments from foreign currency translation, which overall is estimated to account for 5 percentage points of the increase in quarterly revenues.
For the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, BD reported record revenues of $7.156 billion, representing an increase of 13 percent over the prior year, which reflects an overall estimated 6 percent favorable impact from foreign currency translation that affected all segments.
"We are pleased to report another strong year for BD, one in which we exceeded our strategic and financial goals despite a challenging business environment," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "All segments contributed to our success and growth. Implementation of disciplined spending controls enabled us to expand our operating margins as we continued to make significant capital and R&D investments to support our innovation strategy."
Fourth Quarter Earnings and Analysis of Full Fiscal Year 2008 and 2007 Earnings
Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.13 for the fourth quarter increased by 15 percent over reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 98 cents for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2007.
For the twelve-month period ending September 30, 2008, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $4.46. The following analysis (Table 1) of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the twelve-month periods ended September 30, 2008 and 2007 identifies specified items that affect the comparability of results between periods. As illustrated, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.46 for fiscal 2008 increased by 16 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, of $3.84 for fiscal 2007.
The Company estimates that reported revenues for the full fiscal year 2009 will increase approximately 1 to 2 percent. This performance reflects unfavorable foreign currency translation, based on current exchange rates, of an estimated 5 to 6 percentage points. The Company expects diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full fiscal year 2009 to increase approximately 8 to 10 percent over reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.46 for the fiscal year 2008.
(1)
Represents the effect on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of the in-process research and development ("IPR&D") charges recorded in fiscal 2007 related to the Plasso and TriPath acquisitions.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $953 million, representing an increase of 10 percent from the prior year period. Pharmaceutical Systems and Diabetes Care products led revenue growth in the segment. For the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, the BD Medical segment reported 11 percent revenue growth to $3.801 billion.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $553 million, representing an increase of 11 percent from the prior year's quarter. Sales of safety-engineered devices, cancer diagnostics products and infectious disease testing systems contributed to revenue growth. For the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, the BD Diagnostics segment reported revenue growth of 13 percent to $2.160 billion.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $329 million, representing an increase of 16 percent from the prior year's quarter. Demand for clinical and research instruments and reagents were the primary growth drivers. For the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, the BD Biosciences segment reported 16 percent revenue growth to $1.195 billion.
Geographic Results
Fourth quarter revenues in the U.S. were $813 million, representing an increase of 3 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside the U.S. were $1.023 billion, representing an increase of 19 percent over the prior year period, with approximately 9 percentage points of the increase resulting from the favorable impact from foreign currency translation.
For the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, revenues in the U.S. were $3.185 billion, representing an increase of 5 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $3.971 billion, representing an increase of 19 percent over the prior year period, with approximately 11 percentage points of the increase resulting from the favorable impact from foreign currency translation.
Fiscal 2009 Outlook for Full Year
 
This earnings estimate reflects anticipated operating margin improvement, which more than offsets the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.

Franklin Lakes, NJ (January 28, 2009)
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported quarterly revenues of $1.734 billion for the first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2008, representing an increase of 1.6 percent from the prior year period. This quarter's growth rate reflects the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, which overall is estimated to account for nearly 3 percentage points.
"BD is off to a solid start to fiscal 2009. In particular, we continue to see strength in our Biosciences and Diagnostics segments and strong sales of insulin delivery products," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "In addition, our strong earnings per share growth has given us the confidence to raise guidance for fiscal 2009."
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.26 for the first fiscal quarter of 2009 increased by 18 percent from diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.07 for the first fiscal quarter of 2008. These earnings reflect underlying performance as well as the overall impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, including foreign exchange hedging gains.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $891 million, representing a decrease of 2 percent from the prior year period after taking into account an estimated 4 percentage points of unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Strong sales of insulin delivery products were more than offset by a decline in the sales of Medical Surgical Systems products and the expected decline in sales of prefillable devices in the U.S.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $540 million, representing an increase of 3 percent from the prior year period after taking into account an estimated 3 percentage points of unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Sales of safety-engineered devices, cancer diagnostics products and infectious disease testing systems contributed to revenue growth.
 
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $303 million, representing an increase of 11 percent from the prior year period after taking into account an estimated 1 percentage point of favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Demand for clinical and research instruments were the primary growth drivers.
Geographic Results
First quarter revenues in the U.S. were $809 million, representing an increase of 2 percent from the prior year period. Revenues outside the U.S. were $925 million, representing an increase of 1 percent from the prior year period, and reflect an estimated 5 percentage points of unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.
Fiscal 2009 Outlook for Full Year
The Company estimates that diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full fiscal year 2009 will increase approximately 9 to 11 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.46 for the fiscal year 2008.
Conference Call Information
A conference call regarding BD's first quarter results and its expectations for the full fiscal year will be broadcast live on BD's website,

ITEM 2.02     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
On April 28, 2009, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for its second fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2009. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as follows:
Revenues
. We present international and total company revenue growth rates (including
revenues relating to our safety-engineered devices) at constant foreign exchange rates. We believe that this allows investors to view the underlying operating results of BD and
of its segments without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating comparisons to prior periods.
Selling and Administrative Expense
. We present selling and administrative expense,
both alone and as a percentage of revenues, for the quarter and first six months of fiscal
year 2009 after excluding the impact of the charge relating to our agreement to settle certain antitrust class action suits. This charge caused reported
selling and administrative expense to be higher for these periods than it otherwise would
have been, but is not considered by management to be part of ordinary operations.
Accordingly, management believes that these adjusted measures of selling and
administrative expense are more indicative of BD's performance, and allow investors to more easily compare BD's selling and administrative expense for these periods to other periods.
Operating Income
. We present BD's operating income, both alone and as a percentage of
revenues, for the quarter and first six months of fiscal year 2009 after excluding the
impact of the charge relating to our agreement to settle certain
antitrust class action suits. This charge caused reported operating income for these
periods to be lower than it otherwise would have been, but is not considered by
management to be part of ordinary operations. Accordingly, management believes that
these adjusted measures of operating income are more indicative of BD's performance,
and allow investors to more easily compare BD's operating income for these periods to
other periods.
Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate
. We present BD's income taxes and effective tax
rate for the quarter and first six months of fiscal year 2009 after excluding the impact of
the charge relating to our agreement to settle certain antitrust
class action suits. This charge caused both our income taxes and our effective tax rate for
these periods to be lower than they otherwise would have been, but is not considered by
management to be part of ordinary operations. Accordingly, management believes that
these adjusted measures of income taxes and effective tax rate are more indicative of
BD's results, and allow investors to more easily compare BD's income taxes and
effective tax rate for these periods to other periods.
Income from Continuing Operations
. We present BD's income from continuing
operations, both alone and as a percentage of revenues, for the quarter and first six
months of fiscal year 2009 after excluding the impact of the charge relating to our agreement to settle certain antitrust class action suits. This
charge caused reported income from continuing operations for these periods to be lower
than it otherwise would have been, but is not considered by management to be part of
ordinary operations. Accordingly, management believes that these adjusted measures of
income from continuing operations are more indicative of BD's performance, and allow
investors to more easily compare BD's operating income from continuing operations for
these periods to other periods.
Earnings Per Share
. We present BD's diluted earnings per share for the quarter and first
six months of fiscal year 2009 after excluding the impact of the charge relating to our agreement to settle certain antitrust class action suits. This
charge caused reported diluted earnings per share for these periods to be lower than it
otherwise would have been, but is not considered by management to be part of ordinary
operations. Accordingly, management believes that these adjusted measures of diluted
earnings per share are more indicative of BD's performance, and allow investors to more
easily compare BD's diluted earnings per share for these periods to other periods.
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.
ITEM 8.01     OTHER EVENTS

Reports earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.06, or $1.18 after
excluding specified item
Reaffirms guidance for full fiscal year 2009 earnings per share from continuing
operations, excluding specified item
Franklin Lakes, NJ (April 28, 2009)
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported quarterly revenues of $1.741 billion for the second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2009, representing a decrease of 0.4 percent from the prior year period. This quarter's revenue growth rate reflects the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, which overall is estimated to account for 3.4 percentage points.
"In the face of global economic pressures, we are pleased to have achieved top-line growth in all three segments after adjusting for the negative impact of foreign currency translation. This growth, along with our continued focus on disciplined expense and currency risk management, has enabled us to deliver adjusted earnings in line with our expectations," stated Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our strong performance for the first half of fiscal 2009, combined with our commitment to continue to drive efficiency throughout BD, gives us the confidence to reaffirm our guidance for full-year
adjusted
earnings."
Second Quarter and Six-Month Period of Fiscal Year 2009 and 2008 Earnings
Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter were $1.06. Second quarter results included a pre-tax charge of $45 million (11 cents diluted earnings per share from continuing operations) relating to the settlement agreement with the direct purchaser plaintiffs (which includes BD's distributors) in the antitrust class actions, as described in BD's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC today. Second quarter fiscal 2009 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the charge of 11 cents, of $1.18 increased by 8 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.09 for the prior year period. For the six-month period ending March 31, 2009, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.32. Excluding the aforementioned charge of 11 cents, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the six-month period in fiscal 2009 were $2.43, representing an increase of 12.5 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.16 from the prior year period.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $897 million, representing a decrease of 3 percent from the prior year period after taking into account an estimated 5 percentage points of unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. On a currency neutral basis, the increase in worldwide sales of Medical Surgical Systems products was offset in part by the expected decline in sales of prefillable devices in the U.S. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2009, the BD Medical segment reported a 2 percent decrease in revenue growth after taking into account an estimated 4 percentage points of unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. On a currency neutral basis, BD Medical revenues for the six-month period increased by 2 percent.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $540 million, representing
an increase of 2 percent from the prior year period after taking into account an estimated 3 percentage
points of unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Increased sales of safety-engineered devices, cancer diagnostics products and infectious disease testing systems were partially offset by a decline in the sales of flu testing products due to a mild flu season in the U.S. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2009, the BD Diagnostics segment reported 3 percent revenue growth after taking into account an estimated 3 percentage points of unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. On a currency neutral basis, BD Diagnostics revenues for the six-month period increased by 6 percent.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $304 million, representing an increase of 3 percent from the prior year period. Strong international sales growth of research instruments and reagents, primarily in Western Europe and Japan, were offset in part by a slowdown in research-related capital spending in the U.S., particularly in the academic and biotech markets. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2009, the BD Biosciences segment reported 7 percent revenue growth after taking into account an estimated 1 percentage point favorable impact from foreign currency translation. On a currency neutral basis, BD Biosciences revenues for the six-month period increased by 6 percent.
Geographic Results
Second quarter revenues in the U.S. were $778 million, representing a decrease of 1 percent from the prior year period. Revenues outside the U.S. were $963 million, representing flat revenues from the prior year period, and reflect an estimated 6 percentage points of unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.
For the six-month period ended March 31, 2009, revenues in the U.S. were $1.587 billion, representing an increase of 1 percent from the prior year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $1.887 billion, representing an increase of 0.5 percent from the prior year period, and reflect an estimated 6 percentage points of unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.
Fiscal 2009 Outlook for Full Year
Excluding the specified item, the Company reaffirms that diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full fiscal year 2009 will increase approximately 9 to 11 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.46 for the fiscal year 2008. The Company expects that reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full fiscal year 2009 will
increase 7 to 9 percent.

               (iii) The Entity represents and covenants that, except pursuant to appropriate government authorization or as exempted from such regulation, for the past three (3) years, it has not knowingly engaged in, is not now knowingly engaged in, and will not engage in, any dealings or transactions with any Person, or in any country or territory, that at the time of the dealing or transaction is or was the subject of Sanctions.
     2. Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company agrees to issue and sell to each of the Underwriters, and each of the Underwriters agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, at a purchase price of 98.698% of the principal amount thereof for the 2019 Securities and 98.109% of the principal amount thereof for the 2039 Securities, plus accrued interest, if any, from May 15, 2009 to the Time of Delivery (as defined below) hereunder, the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto.
     3. Upon the authorization by you of the release of the Securities, the several Underwriters propose to offer the Securities for sale upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus.
     4. (a) The Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter hereunder will be represented by one or more definitive global Securities in book-entry form which will be deposited by or on behalf of the Company with The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") or its designated custodian. The Company will deliver the Securities to Goldman, Sachs & Co., for the account of each Underwriter, against payment by or on behalf of such Underwriter of the purchase price therefor by wire transfer of Federal (same-day) funds to the account specified by the Company to Goldman, Sachs & Co. at least forty-eight hours in advance, by causing DTC to credit the Securities to the account of Goldman, Sachs & Co. at DTC. The Company will cause the certificates representing the Securities to be made available to Goldman, Sachs & Co. for checking at least twenty-four hours prior to the Time of Delivery (as defined below) at the office of DTC or its designated custodian (the "Designated Office"). The time and date of such delivery and payment shall be 9:30 a.m., New York City time, on May 15, 2009 or such other time and date as Goldman, Sachs & Co. and the Company may agree upon in writing. Such time and date are herein called the "Time of Delivery".
     (b) The documents to be delivered at the Time of Delivery by or on behalf of the parties hereto pursuant to Section 8 hereof, including the cross-receipt for the Securities and any additional documents requested by the
 
Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(h) hereof, will be delivered at the offices of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York, New York 10004 (the "Closing Location"), and the Securities will be delivered at the Designated Office, all at the Time of Delivery. A meeting will be held at the Closing Location at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the New York Business Day next preceding the Time of Delivery, at which meeting the final drafts of the documents to be delivered pursuant to the preceding sentence will be available for review by the parties hereto. For the purposes of this Section 4, "New York Business Day" shall mean each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday which is not a day on which banking institutions in New York City are generally authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.
     5. The Company agrees with each of the Underwriters:
     (a) To prepare the Prospectus in a form approved by you and to file such Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act not later than the Commission's close of business on the second business day following the date of this Agreement; to make no further amendment or any supplement to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus or the Prospectus prior to the Time of Delivery which shall be disapproved by you promptly after reasonable notice thereof; to advise you, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus has been filed and to furnish you with copies thereof; to prepare final term sheets, containing solely a description of the Securities, in a form approved by you and to file such term sheets pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act within the time required by such Rule; to file promptly all other material required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act; to file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act subsequent to the date of the Prospectus and for so long as the delivery of a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is required in connection with the offering or sale of the Securities; to advise you, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any Preliminary Prospectus or other prospectus in respect of the Securities, of any notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act, of the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the Commission for the amending or supplementing of the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or for additional information; and, in the event of the issuance of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any Preliminary Prospectus or other prospectus or suspending any such qualification, to promptly use its best
 
efforts to obtain the withdrawal of such order; and in the event of any such issuance of a notice of objection, promptly to take such steps including, without limitation, amending the Registration Statement or filing a new registration statement, at its own expense, as may be necessary to permit offers and sales of the Securities by the Underwriters (references herein to the Registration Statement shall include any such amendment or new registration statement);
     (b) If required by Rule 430B(h) under the Act, to prepare a form of prospectus in a form approved by you and to file such form of prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act not later than may be required by Rule 424(b) under the Act; and to make no further amendment or supplement to such form of prospectus which shall be disapproved by you promptly after reasonable notice therereof;
     (c) If by the third anniversary (the "Renewal Deadline") of the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, any of the Securities remain unsold by the Underwriters, the Company will file, if it has not already done so and is eligible to do so, a new automatic shelf registration statement relating to the Securities, in a form satisfactory to you. If at the Renewal Deadline the Company is no longer eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the Company will, if it has not already done so, file a new shelf registration statement relating to the Securities, in a form satisfactory to you and will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 180 days after the Renewal Deadline. The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Securities to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement relating to the Securities. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be;
     (d) Promptly from time to time to take such action as you may reasonably request to qualify the Securities for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as you may request and to comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of the Securities, provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction;
     (e) To furnish the Underwriters with written and electronic copies of the Prospectus in such quantities as you may from time to time reasonably request, and, if the delivery of a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is required at any time prior to the expiration of nine months after the time of issue of the Prospectus in connection with the offering or sale of the Securities and if at such time any event shall have occurred as a
 
result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is delivered, not misleading, or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such same period to amend or supplement the Prospectus or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus in order to comply with the Act, the Exchange Act or the Trust Indenture Act, to notify you and upon your request to file such document and to prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter and to any dealer in securities as many written and electronic copies as you may from time to time reasonably request of an amended Prospectus or a supplement to the Prospectus which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance; and in case any Underwriter is required to deliver a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) in connection with sales of any of the Securities at any time nine months or more after the time of issue of the Prospectus, upon your request but at the expense of such Underwriter, to prepare and deliver to such Underwriter as many written and electronic copies as you may request of an amended or supplemented Prospectus complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Act;
     (f) To make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than sixteen months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Act), an earnings statement of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158 under the Act);
     (g) During the period beginning from the date hereof and continuing to and including the later of the Time of Delivery and such earlier time as you may notify the Company, not to offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, make any short sale or otherwise dispose, except as provided hereunder, of any debt securities of the Company which mature more than one year after such Time of Delivery and which are substantially similar to the Securities;
     (h) To pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) under the Act without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) under the Act; and
     (i) To use the net proceeds received by it from the sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement in the manner specified in the Pricing Prospectus under the caption "Use of Proceeds".
 
     6.
     (a) (i) The Company represents and agrees that, other than the final term sheets prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof, without the prior consent of Goldman, Sachs & Co., it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute a "free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 405 under the Act;
          (ii) each Underwriter represents and agrees that, without the prior consent of the Company and Goldman, Sachs & Co., other than one or more term sheets relating to the Securities containing customary information and conveyed to purchasers of Securities, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute a free writing prospectus; and
          (iii) any such free writing prospectus the use of which has been consented to by the Company and Goldman, Sachs & Co. (including the final term sheets prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof) is listed on Schedule II(a) hereto;
     (b) The Company has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 under the Act applicable to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission or retention where required and legending; and
     (c) The Company agrees that if at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus any event occurred or occurs as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Company will give prompt notice thereof to Goldman, Sachs & Co. and, if requested by Goldman, Sachs & Co., will prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or other document which will correct such conflict, statement or omission; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions in an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter expressly for use therein.
     7. The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing, and filing of the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the Prospectus and amendments and
 
supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or producing this Agreement, the Indenture, the Blue Sky Memorandum and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 5(d) hereof, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriter in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky survey; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; (v) the cost of preparing the Securities; (vi) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any agent of the Trustee and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustee in connection with the Indenture and the Securities; and (vii) all other costs and expenses incident to the Company's performance of its obligations hereunder which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section, and Sections 9 and 12 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Securities by them, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.
     8. The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder shall be subject, in their discretion, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company herein are, at and as of the Time of Delivery, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions:
     (a) The Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act and in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; the final term sheets contemplated by Section 5(a) hereof, and any other material required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, shall have been filed with the Commission within the applicable time periods prescribed for such filings by Rule 433; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission and no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act shall have been received; no stop order suspending or preventing the use of the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to your reasonable satisfaction;
 
     (b) Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, shall have furnished to you such opinion or opinions, dated the Time of Delivery, in form and substance satisfactory to you, with respect to the incorporation of the Company, the validity of the Indenture, the Securities, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and other related matters as you may reasonably request, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters;
     (c) The General Counsel for the Company and Special Counsel for the Company satisfactory to the representatives shall have furnished to you their respective written opinions (the content of which is set forth in Annex I(a) and Annex I(b) hereto, respectively), dated the Time of Delivery, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to you;
     (d) At the Time of Delivery, Ernst & Young LLP shall have furnished to you a letter or letters, dated such Time of Delivery, in form and substance satisfactory to you, to the effect set forth in Annex II hereto;
     (e) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Pricing Prospectus there shall not have been any change in the capital stock (other than the repurchases of shares pursuant to Rule 10(b)-18 of the Exchange Act and the issuance of shares under the Company's employee benefit or stock purchase plans or upon conversion of outstanding convertible debt of the Company) or long term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in your judgment so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus;
     (f) On or after the Applicable Time (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities;
 
     (g) On or after the Applicable Time there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the New York Stock Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; or (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, if the effect of any such event specified in this clause (iv) in your judgment makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus; and
     (h) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to you at the Time of Delivery certificates of officers of the Company reasonably satisfactory to you as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such time, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such time, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (e) of this Section and as to such other matters as you may reasonably request.
     9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter expressly for use therein.
 
     (b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party) provided that in the event of such assumption the action may not be compromised or settled by the indemnifying party without the consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. After notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. The indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party pursuant to the provisions of this Section 9 in respect of any action compromised or settled by the indemnifying party, unless the written consent of the indemnifying party shall
 
have been obtained to such compromise or settlement (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person
 
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
     (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
     10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata
 
share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate if so decided by the Company upon notice to the Underwriters pursuant to Section 13 hereunder, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default
     11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
     12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out of pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
     13. In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of the Underwriter made or given by Goldman, Sachs & Co. on behalf of you as the representatives.
     All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or
 
facsimile transmission to you as the representatives in care of Goldman, Sachs & Co., 85 Broad Street, 20th Floor, New York, New York 10004, Attention: Registration Department and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, 1858 Broadway, 29th Floor, New York, New York 10036, Attention: Investment Banking Division (Fax: 212-507-8999); and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by you upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
     14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement.

(i) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and (ii) nothing has come to such counsel's attention that causes such counsel to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities: (a) on the date of the Underwriting Agreement, the Registration Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (b) at the Applicable Time, the Pricing Disclosure Package contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (c) the Prospectus as of the date of the Underwriting Agreement or as of the closing date contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
     In rendering the opinions in paragraphs (2) through (4) above, such counsel may assume that each party to the Documents has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. In addition, such counsel may assume that (i) the execution, delivery and performance by each party thereto of each Document to which it is a party, (a) are within its corporate powers, (b) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other constitutive documents of such party, (c) require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official and (d) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or any judgment, injunction, order or decree or any agreement or other instrument binding upon such party, and (ii) each Document (other than the Underwriting Agreement) is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement of each party thereto, (other than as expressly covered above in respect of the Company).
     Insofar as the foregoing opinions involve matters governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey, such counsel may rely, without independent investigation, on the opinion of the General Counsel for the Company delivered pursuant to Section 8(c) of the Underwriting Agreement.

The Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest (if any) at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions (if any), may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds (if any) and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided. This Note is one of a series designated as the 5.000% Notes due May 15, 2019 (the "Notes") limited in aggregate principal amount to $500,000,000 (except as in the Indenture provided). The Company may, from time to time, without the consent of the existing holders of the Notes, issue additional notes under the Indenture having the same terms as the Notes in all respects, except for issue date, issue price and the initial interest payment date. Any such additional notes will be consolidated with and form a single series with the Notes. Terms defined in the Indenture have the same definitions herein unless otherwise specified.
     In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof and interest hereon may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
     The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of the Securities of any series at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities of such series, each affected series voting separately. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities of any series, on behalf of the holders of all the Securities of such series, to waive certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by or on behalf of the holder of this
 
Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note or such other Note.
     Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Company may elect either (i) to defease and be discharged from any and all obligations with respect to the Notes or (ii) to be released from its obligations with respect to certain covenants applicable to the Notes, upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to this Note.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the place, at the respective times, at the rate and in the coin or currency prescribed herein.
     The Notes are redeemable as a whole or in part at the option of the Company at any time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (2) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments on the Notes, discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis, assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at the Treasury Rate plus 30 basis points, plus in each case, accrued interest to the date of redemption on the principal balance of the Notes being redeemed. For the purposes hereof:
     "Treasury Rate" means, for any redemption date, the annual rate equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue equal to the Comparable Treasury Price, expressed as a percentage of its principal amount, for such redemption date. The yield of the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be computed as of the second business day immediately preceding the redemption date.
     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker that would be used, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the applicable remaining term of the Notes being redeemed.
     "Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of the investment banks the Company may use to select a Comparable Treasury Issue including Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, their successors and any two other nationally recognized investment banking firms that the Company will appoint from time to time that are primary dealers of U.S. government securities
 
in New York City; , that if any of the firms ceases to be a primary dealer of U.S. government securities in New York City, the Company shall appoint another nationally recognized investment banking firm as a substitute therefor.
provided, however
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means, for any redemption date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations obtained by the Trustee for that redemption date after excluding the highest and lowest of those Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations; or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all those quotations.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation" means, with respect to any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue, expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount, quoted in writing to the Trustee by a Reference Treasury Dealer as of 3:30 p.m., New York time, on the third business day preceding that redemption date. The Trustee shall seek Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations in respect of any redemption date from each of the then-existing Reference Treasury Dealers.
     "Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to each note being redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on that Note that would be due after the related redemption date but for the redemption; , that if the redemption date is not an interest payment date with respect to that Note, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment on that Note that would have been due will be deemed reduced by the amount of interest accrued on the Note to the redemption date.
provided, however
     Notice of any redemption shall be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption. On and after any redemption date, the Notes or any portion of the Notes called for redemption will stop accruing interest. On or before any redemption date, the Company will deposit with the paying agent or the Trustee money sufficient to pay the accrued interest on the Notes to be redeemed and their redemption price. If less than all of the Notes are redeemed, the Trustee will choose the Notes to be redeemed by any method that it deems fair and appropriate.
     Upon the presentment for registration of transfer of this Note at the office or agency of the Company designated for such purpose pursuant to the Indenture, a new Note or Notes of authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor, subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.
     Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note, the Company, the Trustee or any Note registrar, co-registrar, paying agent or authenticating agent, may deem and treat the registered holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Note (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon), for the purpose of receiving payment hereof, or on account hereof, and for all other purposes, and the Company, the Trustee and any Note registrar, co-registrar, paying agent and authenticating agent shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary.

Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation ("DTC"), to Issuer or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange, or payment, and any certificate issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE, OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.

     "Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to each note being redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on that Note that would be due after the related redemption date but for the redemption; , that if the redemption date is not an interest payment date with respect to that Note, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment on that Note that would have been due will be deemed reduced by the amount of interest accrued on the Note to the redemption date.
provided, however
     Notice of any redemption shall be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption. On and after any redemption date, the Notes or any portion of the Notes called for redemption will stop accruing interest. On or before any redemption date, the Company will deposit with the paying agent or the Trustee money sufficient to pay the accrued interest on the Notes to be redeemed and their redemption price. If less than all of the Notes are redeemed, the Trustee will choose the Notes to be redeemed by any method that it deems fair and appropriate.
     Upon the presentment for registration of transfer of this Note at the office or agency of the Company designated for such purpose pursuant to the Indenture, a new Note or Notes of authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor, subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.
     Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note, the Company, the Trustee or any Note registrar, co-registrar, paying agent or authenticating agent, may deem and treat the registered holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Note (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon), for the purpose of receiving payment hereof, or on account hereof, and for all other purposes, and the Company, the Trustee and any Note registrar, co-registrar, paying agent and authenticating agent shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary.

ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
On July 30, 2009, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for its third fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2009. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as follows:
 
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.
 
ITEM 5.03 AMENDMENTS TO ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION OR BY-LAWS; CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR.
     On July 28, 2009, BD amended its By-Laws to (i) authorize the chairman or the shareholders to adjourn a shareholders meeting whether or not a quorum is present, (ii) provide a procedure for selecting an acting chair of a board committee meeting in the absence of the appointed chair, and (iii) certain technical and corrective changes.

The shareholders present in person or by proxy at a duly organized meeting may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum. The chairman of the meeting or a majority of the shareholders present in person, or by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting without notice. At such adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.
     SECTION 4. NOTICE OF MEETINGS.

Each holder of preferred stock of any series shall have such voting powers, if any, as the Board of Directors shall have fixed by resolution prior to the issuance of any shares of such series. Whenever any action is to be taken by vote of the shareholders, other than the election of Directors, it shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of the shareholders by the holders of shares entitled to vote, unless a greater plurality is required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation.
     SECTION 6. PROXIES. Any shareholder of record entitled to vote may be represented at any annual or special meeting of the shareholders by a duly appointed proxy. All proxies shall be written and properly signed, but shall require no other attestation, and shall be filed with the Secretary of the meeting before being voted.
     SECTION 7. ORGANIZATION. The Chairman of the Board, or in the absence or disability of the Chairman of the Board or if a vacancy exists in the office of Chairman of the Board, a director or officer designated by the Board of Directors shall act as chairman of the meeting at all meetings of the shareholders. The Secretary, or in his or her absence or disability one of the Assistant Secretaries, shall act as secretary of the meeting. In case none of the officers above designated to act as secretary of the meeting shall be present, a secretary of the meeting shall be chosen by the Board of Directors.
     SECTION 8. ORDER OF BUSINESS. The order of business at all meetings of the shareholders shall be as determined by the chairman of the meeting, but the order of business to be followed at any meeting at which a quorum is present may be changed by a vote of the shareholders.
     SECTION 9. RECORD DATE FOR ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT. In order that the Company may determine the shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting in accordance with law, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Company by delivery to its registered office in New Jersey, its principal place of business or to any officer or agent of the Company having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Company's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a
 
meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
     Nothing in this Article II, Section 9 shall require the Board of Directors to take any action with respect to any proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought other than to fix a record date as provided for herein; and the fixing of any such record date shall not be deemed to be an action taken by the Board of Directors with respect to any such proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought for any other purpose.
     SECTION 10. INSPECTORS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by Article II, Section 9, to the Company of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Company shall engage nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Company that the consents delivered to the Company in accordance with Article II, Section 9 represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any shareholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
     SECTION 11. EFFECTIVENESS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each shareholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with Article II, Section 9, a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to the Company in the manner prescribed in Article II, Section 9.

     SECTION 3. PLACE OF MEETINGS. Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at the principal office of the Company or at such other place within or without
 
the State of New Jersey, as the Chairman of the Board or the Board of Directors may designate.
     SECTION 4. TELEPHONE MEETINGS. Any or all Directors may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof by means of conference telephone or any means of communication by which all persons participating in the meeting are able to hear each other.
     SECTION 5. NOTICE OF MEETINGS. There shall be an annual meeting of the Board of Directors held without notice on the date of the annual meeting of shareholders, or as soon thereafter as convenient, at the same place as the annual meeting of shareholders unless some other location is designated by the Chairman of the Board or by the President. Regular meetings, without notice, may be held at such time and place as the Board of Directors may designate. The Chairman of the Board or the President may call any special meeting of the Board of Directors, and shall do so whenever requested in writing by at least one-third of the Directors. Notice of each special meeting shall be mailed to each Director at least four days before the date on which the meeting is to be held, or be telephoned or sent to each Director by fax, e-mail, telegraph, telex, TWX, cable, wireless or similar means of electronic communication, or be delivered in person, not later than the day before the date on which such meeting is to be held. The Board of Directors may meet to transact business at any time and place without notice, provided that each Director shall be present, or that any Director or Directors not present shall waive notice in writing, either before or after such meeting. The attendance of any Director at a meeting without protesting prior to the conclusion of the meeting the lack of notice of such meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice by him or her. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting. Notice of an adjourned meeting need not be given if the time and place are fixed at the meeting adjourning, and if the period of adjournment does not exceed 10 days in any one adjournment.
     SECTION 6. QUORUM. A majority of the Directors then in office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, but the Director or Directors present, if less than a quorum, may adjourn any meeting from time-to-time until such quorum shall be present. All questions coming before the Board of Directors shall be determined and decided by a majority vote of the Directors present, unless the vote of a greater number is required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws.
     SECTION 7. ACTION WITHOUT A MEETING. The Board of Directors may act without a meeting if, prior or subsequent to such action, each Director shall consent in writing to such action. Such written consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board of Directors.

The Board of Directors, by resolution, from time-to-time, may confer like powers upon any other person or persons.
 
     Dividends shall be declared and paid at such times and in such amounts as the Board of Directors may in its absolute discretion determine and designate, subject to the restrictions and limitations imposed by law.

 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported quarterly revenues of $1.820 billion for the third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2009, representing a decrease of 1.6 percent from the prior-year period. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, which overall is estimated to account for 7 percentage points, worldwide revenues increased 5 percent.
Franklin Lakes, NJ (July 30, 2009)
"We are pleased with our solid third quarter performance and, in particular, the results achieved by our Diagnostics segment and our Medical segment's Pharmaceutical Systems and Diabetes Care units," stated Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "In the face of a challenging global economy, we exceeded our overall expectations in the quarter and, as a result, we are revising our revenue and earnings guidance to the high end of the range previously provided for this year. We remain confident that our focus on productivity improvements and disciplined expense management, along with our ongoing investments in long-term growth opportunities, will ensure BD's future success."
Analyses of Third Quarter and Nine-Month Period of Fiscal Year 2009 and 2008 Earnings
Table 1
 
 
The preceding analysis (Table 1) of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the three-month and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 identifies the specified items that affect comparability of results between periods. As illustrated, third quarter fiscal 2009 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations included a tax benefit of $20 million (8 cents diluted earnings per share from continuing operations) relating to various tax settlements in multiple jurisdictions. Excluding the tax benefit of 8 cents, third quarter fiscal 2009 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.30, representing an increase of 10 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.18 from the prior-year period. Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 included a 7-cents gain from our hedging program.
For the nine-month period, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $3.67 included the aforementioned tax benefit of 8 cents and the second quarter charge of 11 cents relating to a pending antitrust class action settlement. Excluding these specified items, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the nine-month period in fiscal year 2009 were $3.70, representing an increase of 12 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $3.31 from the prior-year period. Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the nine-month period ending June 30, 2009 included a 23-cents gain from our hedging program.
Home Healthcare Product Line Sold
In July 2009, the Company sold the assets associated with its Home Healthcare product line to 3M, including product inventory, brand names and manufacturing associated with ACE, Tensor, Bauer & Blackand Tru-Fit products, and thermometers. Consequently, the results of operations of the Home Healthcare product line have been classified as discontinued operations for all quarters and years referred to in this release. Included in the attached financial tables are the Company's Consolidated Income Statements for the first two quarters of fiscal year 2009 and for all periods in fiscal year 2008, which reflect this classification change. The Company expects to record a gain on the sale of about 5 cents diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations in the fourth fiscal quarter.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $969 million, representing a decrease of 3 percent from the prior year period. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of an estimated 8 percentage points, revenues increased 5 percent in the quarter due in part to sales of insulin delivery products, as well as safety-engineered and prefillable devices. For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2009 the BD Medical segment reported a 2 percent decrease in revenue growth. On a currency neutral basis, BD Medical revenues for the nine-month period increased by 3 percent.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $566 million, representing an increase of 2 percent from the prior year period. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of an estimated 6 percentage points, revenues increased 8 percent in the quarter. Sales of safety-engineered devices, cancer diagnostics products and infectious disease testing systems, including flu-related products, contributed to revenue growth. For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2009 the BD Diagnostics segment reported 2.5 percent revenue growth. On a currency neutral basis, BD Diagnostics revenues for the nine-month period increased by 6.5 percent.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $285 million, representing a decrease of 4 percent from the prior year period. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of an estimated 3 percentage points, revenues decreased 1 percent in the quarter.
 
Demand in the U.S. for capital equipment in the research and clinical segments continued to be impacted by funding constraints. International revenue growth moderated in the third quarter primarily due to lessening demand for instruments in Europe and Japan. For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2009 the BD Biosciences segment reported 3 percent revenue growth. On a currency neutral basis, BD Biosciences revenues for the nine-month period increased by 4 percent.
Geographic Results
Third quarter revenues in the U.S. were $805 million, representing an increase of 3 percent from the prior year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $1.015 billion, representing a decrease of 5 percent from the prior year period, and reflect an estimated 11 percentage points of unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.
For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2009, revenues in the U.S. were $2.365 billion, representing an increase of 2 percent from the prior year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $2.898 billion, representing a decrease of 1 percent from the prior year period, and reflect an estimated 8 percentage points of unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.
Fiscal 2009 Outlook for Full Year
The Company revised its guidance for full fiscal year 2009 reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to approximately 11 to 12 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.42 for the full fiscal year 2008. The Company's guidance for full fiscal year 2009 includes an approximate 28-cents gain from our hedging program as discussed on our April 28, 2009 second fiscal quarter conference call.
The following analysis of estimated diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full fiscal year identifies specified items that affect the comparability of results between periods. As illustrated in Table 2, the Company expects that diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full fiscal year 2009, excluding specified items, will be approximately $4.92 to $4.96, representing an increase of approximately 11 to 12 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.42 for the fiscal year 2008.

ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On November 4, 2009, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ending September 30, 2009. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP measures"). As described below, certain of these non-GAAP measures eliminate the effect of the charge relating to our pending settlement of certain antitrust class action suits (the "Litigation Charge") and the tax benefit relating to various tax settlements (the "Tax Benefit") that occurred in fiscal year 2009. In addition, during fiscal year 2009, the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against most foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, compared to rates from fiscal year 2008. As a result, foreign currency translation impacted our operating results to a greater degree than we have typically experienced. Accordingly, certain non-GAAP measures eliminate the effect of foreign currency translation, including gains from our hedging activities.
 
 
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.
 
A reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP measure is furnished as Exhibit 99.2 to this report.
Item 8.01 OTHER EVENTS
On October 19, 2009, Gen-Probe Incorporated ("Gen-Probe") filed a patent infringement action against BD in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. The complaint alleges that certain specimen collection products of BD infringe eight U.S. patents of Gen-Probe. Gen-Probe is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to this action and intend to defend this matter vigorously.
 
ITEM 9.01 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.

ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On January 28, 2010, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for its first fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2009. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP measures"), as follows:
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.
 
ITEM 9.01 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported quarterly revenues of $1.917 billion for the first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2009, representing an increase of 12 percent from the prior-year period, or 9 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Franklin Lakes, NJ (January 28, 2010)
"We are pleased with our solid start to fiscal 2010. Our BD Medical and BD Diagnostics segments led our revenue growth, aided by flu-related sales," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our revenue growth, good operating performance and a stabilizing Biosciences business this quarter give us the confidence to raise guidance for fiscal 2010."
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter were $1.30, an increase of 4 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.25 for the first quarter of
 
2009. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 increased 11 percent.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $1.019 billion, representing an increase of 16 percent from the prior-year period, or 13 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Strong sales of Medical Surgical Systems and Pharmaceutical Systems products, including about 7 percentage points from flu-related products, as well as Diabetes Care products contributed to revenue growth.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $595 million, representing an increase of 10 percent from the prior-year period, or 8 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Sales of safety-engineered devices and infectious disease testing systems, including about 2 percentage points from flu-related products, contributed to revenue growth.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues of $303 million for the quarter were flat compared with the prior-year period. Revenues increased less than 1 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Demand for clinical and research instruments, as expected, continues to be impacted by capital funding constraints.
Geographic Results
First quarter revenues in the U.S. were $873 million, representing an increase of 10 percent from the prior-year period. Revenues outside the U.S. were $1.044 billion, representing an increase of 13 percent from the prior-year period, or 8.5 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
 
Fiscal 2010 Outlook
We expect reported revenues for the full fiscal year 2010 to increase approximately 7 percent, or 6 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis, compared with our prior guidance of 6 percent, or 5 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
We also expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full fiscal year 2010 to increase approximately 2 to 4 percent, to $5.05 to $5.15, over adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, of $4.95 for the fiscal year 2009, or 8 to 10 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Our prior guidance was an increase of 1 to 3 percent, or 7 to 9 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.

 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported quarterly revenues of $1.845 billion for the second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2010, representing an increase of 7.0 percent from the prior-year period, or 6.6 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Franklin Lakes, NJ (April 29, 2010)
"We are pleased with our second quarter results, which are in line with the Company's expectations," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Solid revenue growth in our Medical segment and a continued improvement in our Biosciences segment offset lower than expected growth in our Diagnostics segment. Our strong overall operating performance for the first half of fiscal 2010 gives us the confidence to reaffirm our guidance for full-year adjusted earnings."
 
Second Quarter and Six-Month Fiscal 2010 Operating Results
Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter were $1.24 compared with $1.05 in the prior-year period. Current quarter results included a non-cash charge of $8.9 million, or $0.04 per share from continuing operations related to healthcare reform impacting Medicare Part D reimbursements, and the prior-year period included a litigation charge of $45 million, or $0.11 per share. Excluding these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 8.5 percent to $1.27, compared with $1.17 adjusted earnings per share in the prior-year period. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter increased by 16.2 percent.
For the six-month period ending March 31, 2010, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.53 compared with $2.30 in the prior-year period. Excluding the aforementioned charges, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.57, an increase of 6.6 percent over adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.41 in the prior-year period. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the six-month period increased 14.1 percent.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $967 million, representing an increase of 9.7 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 7.8 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Revenues reflect strong sales of Diabetes Care and Pharmaceutical Systems products. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2010, BD Medical revenues increased 13.0 percent, or 10.2 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
 
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $556 million, representing an increase of 3.0 percent compared with the prior-year period. Segment revenues increased 2.7 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis, impacted by a reduction in lab testing and a decline in flu-related testing due to an exceptionally mild flu season. These were offset by strong growth in cancer and STD product platforms. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2010, BD Diagnostics revenues increased 6.6 percent, or 5.4 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $322 million, representing an increase of 6.0 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues increased 9.8 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis, driven by Cell Analysis and Discovery Labware growth in certain markets. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2010, BD Biosciences revenues increased by 3.0 percent, or 5.2 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Geographic Results
Second quarter revenues in the U.S. were $810 million, representing an increase of 6.0 percent from the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $1.035 billion, representing an increase of 7.7 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 7.0 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
For the six-month period ended March 31, 2010, revenues in the U.S. were $1.683 billion, representing an increase of 7.9 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $2.078 billion, representing an increase of 10.4 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 7.8 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
 
Fiscal 2010 Outlook
We expect reported revenues for the full year fiscal 2010 to increase approximately 6 percent, or about 1 percent less than our previously communicated guidance due to currency fluctuations. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, we expect revenues to increase approximately 6 percent, which is in line with our previously communicated guidance.
We also expect reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full year fiscal 2010 to be $5.01 to $5.11. Excluding the aforementioned charge of $0.04 related to healthcare reform impacting Medicare Part D reimbursements, we reaffirm our guidance that we expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full year fiscal 2010 will increase approximately 2 to 4 percent to $5.05 to $5.15, or 8 to 10 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. This is compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the litigation charge of $0.11 and a tax benefit adjustment of $0.08, of $4.95 for fiscal year 2009. Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2009 were $4.92.

ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On July 29, 2010, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for its third fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2010. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP measures"), as follows:
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.
 
ITEM 9.01 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.

- BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX), a leading global medical technology company, today reported quarterly revenues of $1.878 billion for the third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2010, representing an increase of 3.2 percent from the prior-year period, or 3.9 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Franklin Lakes, NJ (July 29, 2010)
 
"We are pleased with our results this quarter, with each of our three segments contributing to our growth. We delivered earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.29, which is in line with the Company's expectations," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Despite the challenging global economy, we expect to deliver bottom-line growth of approximately 9 percent foreign-currency neutral, which is in line with our previously communicated range of 8 to 10 percent for the full fiscal year 2010. Profits and cash flows continue to improve as a result of operational efficiencies. We are also pleased to announce that we are increasing our share repurchases to $700 million from $550 million, which supports our ongoing commitment to return value to shareholders."
Update on the Sale of Certain Assets in the BD Medical Segment
In May 2010, the Company signed agreements to sell certain assets of its BD Medical segment, including the Ophthalmic Systems unit as well as the surgical blades, critical care and extended dwell catheter product platforms of the Medical Surgical Systems unit. For the full fiscal year 2010, revenues and earnings per share associated with these asset groups were estimated at $200 million and $0.20, respectively. The results of operations associated with these asset groups have not been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial tables as the criteria for such classification were not met in the third fiscal quarter 2010. The Company expects to record a gain on the sale in the fourth fiscal quarter 2010, when the transaction is expected to be completed.
Third Quarter and Nine-Month Fiscal Year 2010 Operating Results
Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter were $1.29, compared with $1.38 in the prior-year period, representing a 6.5 percent decrease. The prior-year period included a $20 million, or $0.08 per share, tax benefit related to various tax settlements in
 
multiple jurisdictions. Excluding this item, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.30. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter increased by 6.9 percent.
For the nine-month period ending June 30, 2010, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $3.81, compared with $3.67 in the prior-year period, representing an increase of 3.8 percent. Current year-to-date results include a non-cash charge of $8.9 million, or $0.04 per share from continuing operations related to healthcare reform impacting Medicare Part D reimbursements, and the prior-year period included the aforementioned tax benefit of $0.08 and a litigation charge of $45 million, or $0.11 per share. Excluding these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 4.1 percent to $3.85, compared with $3.70 adjusted earnings per share in the prior-year period. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the nine-month period increased 11.4 percent.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $993 million, representing an increase of 2.5 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 2.7 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Revenues reflected solid sales of Diabetes Care products, which were partially offset by softer Pharmaceutical Systems revenues due to timing of orders in the quarter. The comparison to prior year is also negatively impacted by about 1 percentage point due to the H1N1 flu pandemic in fiscal year 2009. For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2010, BD Medical revenues increased 9.3 percent, or 7.6 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
 
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $576 million, representing an increase of 1.7 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 2.0 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Economic pressures in the U.S., resulting in reduced physician office visits, and reduced diagnostic volumes in Europe were the primary headwinds in the quarter. The comparison to prior year is also negatively impacted by 1.6 percentage points due to the H1N1 flu pandemic in fiscal year 2009. For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2010, BD Diagnostics revenues increased 4.9 percent, or 4.3 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $309 million, representing an increase of 8.4 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues increased 11.6 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis, primarily driven by cell analysis instrument and reagent sales in the U.S., supplemental funding in Japan and a favorable comparison versus the prior-year period. For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2010, BD Biosciences revenues increased 4.7 percent, or 7.3 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Geographic Results
Third quarter revenues in the U.S. were $830 million, representing an increase of 3.0 percent from the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $1.049 billion, representing an increase of 3.3 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 4.6 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Revenues reflected continuing strength in emerging markets, which was offset by slower growth in Europe. For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2010, revenues in the U.S. were $2.513 billion, representing an increase of 6.3 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $3.127 billion, representing an increase of 7.9 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 6.7 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
 
Fiscal 2010 Outlook
We expect reported revenues for the full year fiscal 2010 to increase approximately 5 percent, which is one percentage point less than previously communicated guidance, mainly driven by a weaker Euro and overall lower lab testing in the U.S. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, we expect revenues to increase 5 to 6 percent, as compared to our previously communicated guidance of about 6 percent, reflecting the lower lab testing and hospital demand.
We also expect reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full year fiscal 2010 to increase about 3 percent from $4.92 in fiscal year 2009. Excluding the aforementioned charge of $0.04 related to healthcare reform impacting Medicare Part D reimbursements, we expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full year fiscal 2010 will increase 3 to 4 percent, or about 9 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis, which is in line with our previously communicated guidance. This is compared with adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the litigation charge of $0.11 and the tax benefit adjustment of $0.08, of $4.95 for fiscal year 2009.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
     As previously reported, on April 27, 2009, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") entered into a settlement agreement with certain purchaser plaintiffs (including BD's distributors) in the antitrust class actions consolidated in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey under the caption "". The settlement agreement provided for, among other things, the payment by BD of $45 million in exchange for a release by all potential class members of the direct purchaser claims under federal antitrust laws related to the products and acts enumerated in the complaint, and a dismissal of the case with prejudice, insofar as it relates to direct purchaser claims. On September 30, 2010, the court issued an order denying a motion to approve the settlement agreement, ruling that the hospital plaintiffs, and not the distributor plaintiffs, are the direct purchasers entitled to pursue damages under the federal antitrust laws for certain sales of BD products. The settlement agreement currently remains in effect, subject to certain termination provisions, and the court's order may be subject to appellate review. Accordingly, BD is not adjusting the provision it recognized for the settlement agreement in the second quarter of fiscal year 2009.

BD ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR 2010 FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER AND FULL YEAR
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX), a leading global medical technology company, today reported quarterly revenues of $1.873 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2010, representing an increase of 1.0 percent from the prior-year period, or 2.9 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Franklin Lakes, NJ (November 3, 2010)
 
For the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, BD reported revenues of $7.372 billion, representing an increase of 5.5 percent over the prior year, or 5.6 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
The Company also plans to repurchase $1.5 billion of its common stock in 2011 and an additional $600 million in 2012. The Company plans to fund the repurchases through ongoing cash flow and the issuance of debt.
"We are proud of our accomplishments during 2010. We met our financial and operational goals despite the challenging macroeconomic climate facing our industry," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our solid performance has enabled us to continue to return significant value to shareholders and also to invest in key geographic expansion, new product platforms and businesses and operational excellence programs. We have confidence in our outlook for fiscal year 2011 and remain committed to serving our customers with superior healthcare products."
Update on the Sale of Certain Assets in the BD Medical Segment
In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, the Company completed the sale of the Ophthalmic Systems unit as well as the surgical blades, critical care and extended dwell catheter product platforms. The results of operations associated with the Ophthalmic Systems unit, surgical blade platform and critical care platform have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all quarters and years referred to in this release.
 
As illustrated on page 3 of the attached financial tables, diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of $0.44 consisted of $0.06 from operations and $0.39 from the gain on the sale. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of $1.68 less the $0.44 from discontinued operations resulted in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.24. Diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations for the year of $0.59 consisted of $0.21 from operations and $0.38 from the gain on the sale. Diluted earnings per share for the year of $5.49 less the $0.59 from discontinued operations resulted in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.90.
Also included in the attached financial tables are the Company's Consolidated Income Statements for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2010 and for all periods in fiscal year 2009 for reference, which reflect the reclassification change for the Ophthalmic Systems unit, surgical blade platform and critical care platform. The results of operations associated with the extended dwell catheter product platform are reported within continuing operations, as this asset group did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations.
Fourth Quarter Earnings and Analysis of the Full Fiscal Year 2010 and 2009 Earnings
Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter were $1.24, compared with $1.20 in the prior-year period, representing a 3.3 percent increase. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter increased by 1.7 percent.
 
For the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $4.90, compared with $4.73 in the prior fiscal year, representing an increase of 3.6 percent. Current full fiscal year results include a previously disclosed non-cash charge of $8.9 million, or $0.04 per share from continuing operations, related to healthcare reform impacting Medicare Part D reimbursements. The prior fiscal year included a $20 million, or $0.08 per share, tax benefit related to various tax settlements in multiple jurisdictions and a litigation charge of $45 million, or $0.11 per share, which were also previously disclosed. Excluding these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 3.8 percent to $4.94, compared with $4.76 adjusted diluted earnings per share in the prior-year period. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fiscal year increased 9.2 percent.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $959 million, representing a decrease of 0.3 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues increased 2.1 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Segment revenue growth reflected an unfavorable comparison to the prior year of 4.3 percentage points due to the sales related to the H1N1 flu pandemic in fiscal year 2009, partially offset by strong growth in the Diabetes Care business. For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2010, BD Medical revenues increased 6.7 percent, or 6.2 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $591 million, representing an increase of 2.0 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 3.1 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Segment revenue growth was negatively impacted by 2.4 percentage points due to sales
 
related to the flu pandemic in fiscal year 2009 in addition to lower lab testing and reduced physician office visits. For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2010, BD Diagnostics revenues increased 4.2 percent, or 4.0 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $323 million, representing an increase of 3.5 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues increased 5.3 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis, primarily driven by instrument and reagent sales in the Cell Analysis business unit. For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2010, BD Biosciences revenues increased 4.4 percent, or 6.8 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Geographic Results
Fourth quarter revenues in the U.S. were $832 million, representing an increase of 1.4 percent compared with the prior-year period, including a negative impact of 1.8 percentage points related to the flu pandemic. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $1.041 billion, representing an increase of 0.8 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 4.2 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. International revenue growth was negatively impacted by 4 percentage points due to the H1N1 flu pandemic-related sales in fiscal year 2009. Revenues reflected continuing strength in emerging markets, which was partially offset by slower growth in Europe. For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2010, revenues in the U.S. were $3.287 billion, representing an increase of 5.0 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $4.086 billion, representing an increase of 5.9 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 6.0 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.

Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company agrees to issue and sell to each of the Underwriters, and each of the Underwriters agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, at a purchase price of 99.299% of the principal amount thereof for the 2020 Securities and 98.724% of the principal amount thereof for the 2040 Securities, plus accrued interest, if any, from November 12, 2010 to the Time of Delivery (as defined below) hereunder, the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto.
     3. Upon the authorization by you of the release of the Securities, the several Underwriters propose to offer the Securities for sale upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus.
     4. (a) The Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter hereunder will be represented by one or more definitive global Securities in book-entry form which will be deposited by or on behalf of the Company with The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") or its designated custodian. The Company will deliver the Securities to the Representatives, for the account of each Underwriter, against payment by or on behalf of such Underwriter of the purchase price therefor by wire transfer of Federal (same-day) funds to the account specified by the Company to the Representatives at least forty-eight hours in advance, by causing DTC to credit the Securities to the account of the Representatives at DTC. The Company will cause the certificates representing the Securities to be made available to the Representatives for checking at least twenty-four hours prior to the Time of Delivery (as defined below) at the office of DTC or its designated custodian (the "Designated Office"). The time and date of such delivery and payment shall be 9:30 a.m., New York City time, on November 12, 2010 or such other time and date as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing. Such time and date are herein called the "Time of Delivery".
     (b) The documents to be delivered at the Time of Delivery by or on behalf of the parties hereto pursuant to Section 8 hereof, including the cross-receipt for the Securities and any additional documents requested by the
 
Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(h) hereof, will be delivered at the offices of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York, New York 10004 (the "Closing Location"), and the Securities will be delivered at the Designated Office, all at the Time of Delivery. A meeting will be held at the Closing Location at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the New York Business Day next preceding the Time of Delivery, at which meeting the final drafts of the documents to be delivered pursuant to the preceding sentence will be available for review by the parties hereto. For the purposes of this Section 4, "New York Business Day" shall mean each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday which is not a day on which banking institutions in New York City are generally authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.
     5. The Company agrees with each of the Underwriters:
     (a) To prepare the Prospectus in a form approved by you and to file such Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act not later than the Commission's close of business on the second business day following the date of this Agreement; to make no further amendment or any supplement to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus or the Prospectus prior to the Time of Delivery which shall be disapproved by you promptly after reasonable notice thereof; to advise you, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus has been filed and to furnish you with copies thereof; to prepare final term sheets, containing solely a description of the Securities, in a form approved by you and to file such term sheets pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act within the time required by such Rule; to file promptly all other material required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act; to file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act subsequent to the date of the Prospectus and for so long as the delivery of a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is required in connection with the offering or sale of the Securities; to advise you, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any Preliminary Prospectus or other prospectus in respect of the Securities, of any notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act, of the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the Commission for the amending or supplementing of the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or for additional information; and, in the event of the issuance of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any Preliminary Prospectus or other prospectus or suspending any such qualification, to promptly use its best
 
efforts to obtain the withdrawal of such order; and in the event of any such issuance of a notice of objection, promptly to take such steps including, without limitation, amending the Registration Statement or filing a new registration statement, at its own expense, as may be necessary to permit offers and sales of the Securities by the Underwriters (references herein to the Registration Statement shall include any such amendment or new registration statement);
     (b) If required by Rule 430B(h) under the Act, to prepare a form of prospectus in a form approved by you and to file such form of prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act not later than may be required by Rule 424(b) under the Act; and to make no further amendment or supplement to such form of prospectus which shall be disapproved by you promptly after reasonable notice therereof;
     (c) If by the third anniversary (the "Renewal Deadline") of the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, any of the Securities remain unsold by the Underwriters, the Company will file, if it has not already done so and is eligible to do so, a new automatic shelf registration statement relating to the Securities, in a form satisfactory to you. If at the Renewal Deadline the Company is no longer eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the Company will, if it has not already done so, file a new shelf registration statement relating to the Securities, in a form satisfactory to you and will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 180 days after the Renewal Deadline. The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Securities to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement relating to the Securities. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be;
     (d) Promptly from time to time to take such action as you may reasonably request to qualify the Securities for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as you may request and to comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of the Securities, provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction;
     (e) To furnish the Underwriters with written and electronic copies of the Prospectus in such quantities as you may from time to time reasonably request, and, if the delivery of a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is required at any time prior to the expiration of nine months after the time of issue of the Prospectus in connection with the offering or sale of the Securities and if at such time any event shall have occurred as a
 
result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is delivered, not misleading, or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such same period to amend or supplement the Prospectus or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus in order to comply with the Act, the Exchange Act or the Trust Indenture Act, to notify you and upon your request to file such document and to prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter and to any dealer in securities as many written and electronic copies as you may from time to time reasonably request of an amended Prospectus or a supplement to the Prospectus which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance; and in case any Underwriter is required to deliver a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) in connection with sales of any of the Securities at any time nine months or more after the time of issue of the Prospectus, upon your request but at the expense of such Underwriter, to prepare and deliver to such Underwriter as many written and electronic copies as you may request of an amended or supplemented Prospectus complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Act;
     (f) To make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than sixteen months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Act), an earnings statement of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158 under the Act);
     (g) During the period beginning from the date hereof and continuing to and including the later of the Time of Delivery and such earlier time as you may notify the Company, not to offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, make any short sale or otherwise dispose, except as provided hereunder, of any debt securities of the Company which mature more than one year after such Time of Delivery and which are substantially similar to the Securities;
     (h) To pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) under the Act without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) under the Act; and
     (i) To use the net proceeds received by it from the sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement in the manner specified in the Pricing Prospectus under the caption "Use of Proceeds".
 
     6.
     (a) (i) The Company represents and agrees that, other than the final term sheets prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof, without the prior consent of the Representatives, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute a "free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 405 under the Act;
          (ii) each Underwriter represents and agrees that, without the prior consent of the Company and the Representatives, other than one or more term sheets relating to the Securities containing customary information and conveyed to purchasers of Securities, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute a free writing prospectus; and
          (iii) any such free writing prospectus the use of which has been consented to by the Company and the Representatives (other than the final term sheets prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof) is listed on Schedule II(a) hereto;
     (b) The Company has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 under the Act applicable to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission or retention where required and legending; and
     (c) The Company agrees that if at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus any event occurred or occurs as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Company will give prompt notice thereof to the Representatives and, if requested by the Representatives, will prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or other document which will correct such conflict, statement or omission; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions in an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter expressly for use therein.
     7. The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing, and filing of the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the Prospectus and amendments and
 
supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or producing this Agreement, the Indenture, the Blue Sky Memorandum and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 5(d) hereof, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriter in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky survey; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; (v) the cost of preparing the Securities; (vi) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any agent of the Trustee and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustee in connection with the Indenture and the Securities; and (vii) all other costs and expenses incident to the Company's performance of its obligations hereunder which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section, and Sections 9 and 12 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Securities by them, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.
     8. The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder shall be subject, in their discretion, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company herein are, at and as of the Time of Delivery, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions:
     (a) The Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act and in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; the final term sheets contemplated by Section 5(a) hereof, and any other material required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, shall have been filed with the Commission within the applicable time periods prescribed for such filings by Rule 433; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission and no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act shall have been received; no stop order suspending or preventing the use of the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to your reasonable satisfaction;
 
     (b) Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, shall have furnished to you such opinion or opinions, dated the Time of Delivery, in form and substance satisfactory to you, with respect to the incorporation of the Company, the validity of the Indenture, the Securities, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and other related matters as you may reasonably request, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters;
     (c) The General Counsel for the Company and Special Counsel for the Company satisfactory to the Representatives shall have furnished to you their respective written opinions (the content of which is set forth in Annex I(a) and Annex I(b) hereto, respectively), dated the Time of Delivery, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to you;
     (d) At the Time of Delivery, Ernst & Young LLP shall have furnished to you a letter or letters, dated such Time of Delivery, in form and substance satisfactory to you, to the effect set forth in Annex II hereto;
     (e) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Pricing Prospectus there shall not have been any change in the capital stock (other than the repurchases of shares pursuant to Rule 10(b)-18 of the Exchange Act and the issuance of shares under the Company's employee benefit or stock purchase plans or upon conversion of outstanding convertible debt of the Company) or long term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in your judgment so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus;
     (f) On or after the Applicable Time (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities;
 
     (g) On or after the Applicable Time there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the New York Stock Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; or (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, if the effect of any such event specified in this clause (iv) in your judgment makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus; and
     (h) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to you at the Time of Delivery certificates of officers of the Company reasonably satisfactory to you as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such time, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such time, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (e) of this Section and as to such other matters as you may reasonably request.
     9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter expressly for use therein.
 
     (b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party) provided that in the event of such assumption the action may not be compromised or settled by the indemnifying party without the consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. After notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. The indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party pursuant to the provisions of this Section 9 in respect of any action compromised or settled by the indemnified party, unless the written consent of the indemnifying party shall
 
have been obtained to such compromise or settlement (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person
 
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
     (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
     10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata
 
share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate if so decided by the Company upon notice to the Underwriters pursuant to Section 13 hereunder, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default
     11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
     12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out of pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
     13. In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of the Underwriters made or given by you as the Representatives.
     All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or
 
facsimile transmission to you as the Representatives in care of Goldman, Sachs & Co., 200 West Street, New York, New York 10282-2198, Attention: Registration Department and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, 1858 Broadway, 29th Floor, New York, New York 10036, Attention: Investment Banking Division (Fax: 212-507-8999); and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by you upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
     In accordance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the underwriters are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their respective clients, including the Company, which information may include the name and address of their respective clients, as well as other information that will allow the underwriters to properly identify their respective clients.
     14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.

If less than all of the Notes are redeemed, the Trustee will choose the Notes to be redeemed by any method that it deems fair and appropriate.
     Upon the presentment for registration of transfer of this Note at the office or agency of the Company designated for such purpose pursuant to the Indenture, a new Note or Notes of authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor, subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.
     Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note, the Company, the Trustee or any Note registrar, co-registrar, paying agent or authenticating agent, may deem and treat the registered holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Note (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon), for the purpose of receiving payment hereof, or an account hereof, and for all other purposes, and the Company, the Trustee and any Note registrar, co-registrar, paying agent and authenticating agent shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary.

Exhibit 5.1
November 12, 2010
Becton, Dickinson and Company 1 Becton Drive Franklin Lakes, NJ 07417-1880
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as counsel to Becton, Dickinson and Company, a New Jersey corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-159102)(the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), relating to the issuance by the Company of $700,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.25% Notes due 2020 (the "2020 Notes") and $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Notes due 2040 (the "2040 Notes", and together with the 2020 Notes, the "Notes"). The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to the Prospectus, dated May 8, 2009, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, dated November 8, 2010 (together, the "Prospectus"), filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2) under the Securities Act, and an Underwriting Agreement dated November 8, 2010 (the "Underwriting Agreement") between the Company and the several underwriters named therein.
     The Notes will be issued under an indenture (the "Indenture") dated as of March 1, 1997 between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee").
 
     We have examined the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Indenture, which has been filed with the Commission as an exhibit to the Registration Statement. We also have examined the originals, or duplicates or certified or conformed copies, of such corporate and other records, agreements, documents and other instruments and have made such other investigations as we have deemed relevant and necessary in connection with the opinions hereinafter set forth. As to questions of fact material to this opinion, we have relied upon certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company.
     In rendering the opinion set forth below, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as duplicates or certified or conformed copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. We also have assumed that the Indenture is the valid and legally binding obligation of the Trustee.
     We have assumed further that (1) the Company has duly authorized, executed and delivered the Indenture in accordance with the law of New Jersey and (2) the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Indenture and the Notes do not and will not violate the law of New Jersey or any other applicable laws (excepting the law of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States).
     Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications, assumptions and limitations stated herein, we are of the opinion that, assuming the due execution, authentication, issuance and delivery of the Notes, upon payment of the consideration therefor provided for in the Underwriting Agreement and otherwise in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and the
 
Underwriting Agreement, the Notes will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
     Our opinion set forth above is subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (iii) an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
     We do not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the law of the State of New York and the federal law of the United States.
     We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion letter as Exhibit 5.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on November 12, 2010 and to the use of our name under the caption "Validity of Notes" in the Prospectus included in the Registration Statement.

ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On February 7, 2011, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for its first fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2010. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP measures"), as follows:
     BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
     BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
     Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.

 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX), a leading global medical technology company, today reported quarterly revenues of $1.842 billion for the first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2010, representing a decrease of 1.4 percent from the prior-year period. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, revenue decreased 1.5 percent. The revenue decline reflects an unfavorable comparison to the prior year of about 4 percentage points due to strong sales related to the pandemic flu and U.S. stimulus revenues in fiscal 2010.
Franklin Lakes, NJ (February 7, 2011)
The Company also repurchased $837 million of its common stock during the quarter. BD continues to plan aggregate share repurchases of $1.5 billion in fiscal 2011 and an additional $600 million in fiscal 2012.
"We are pleased with our performance in the first fiscal quarter given the challenging environment," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "While revenue came in slightly below our expectations, our discipline around operational excellence enabled us to deliver earnings per share in line with our previous guidance. We continued to return significant value to shareholders, while also investing in geographic expansion, new product platforms and operational excellence programs."
 
Reported diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.35, compared with $1.25 in the prior-year period, representing an 8.0 percent increase. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, diluted earnings per share for the first quarter increased by 4.8 percent.
First Quarter Earnings
For the quarter, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations included an approximate $0.07 favorable impact due to the timing of certain tax benefits. These benefits, which were reflected in our previous full year guidance, resulted from certain first quarter events, including the retroactive extension of the U.S. research tax credit.
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $927 million, representing a decrease of 4.5 percent compared with the prior-year period, or a decrease of 4.3 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. The segment's revenue decline reflects an unfavorable comparison to the prior year of about 6 percentage points due to strong sales related to the H1N1 flu pandemic in fiscal year 2010, partially offset by solid growth in the Diabetes Care unit with particularly strong growth in pen needles.
Segment Results
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $602 million, representing an increase of 1.0 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 0.6 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Segment revenue growth was negatively impacted by about 2 percentage points due to strong sales related to the flu pandemic in fiscal year 2010. The segment growth was primarily driven by strong sales in Preanalytical Systems safety-engineered products, and Women's Health and Cancer in the Diagnostic Systems unit.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $314 million, representing an increase of 3.7 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 3.5 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Segment revenue growth was negatively impacted by about 2 percentage points due to strong sales related to stimulus spending in the U.S. in fiscal year 2010. Segment growth was primarily driven by instrument and reagent sales in the Cell Analysis unit.
First quarter revenues in the U.S. were $829 million, representing a decrease of 2.9 percent compared with the prior-year period, including a negative impact of 6.0 percentage points due to flu pandemic-related sales in fiscal year 2010. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $1.013 billion, representing a decrease of 0.2 percent compared with the prior-year period, or a decrease of 0.3 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. International revenue growth was negatively impacted by about 3 percentage points related to the flu pandemic in fiscal year 2010. Revenues reflected continued strength in emerging markets, which was partially offset by a decline in sales in Europe.
Geographic Results
The Company continues to estimate that reported revenues for the full fiscal year 2011 will increase about 4 percent compared to fiscal year 2010. The Company also continues to expect reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2011 to be between $5.45 and $5.55, an increase of approximately 11 to 13 percent over fiscal year 2010. Diluted earnings per share from
Company Reaffirms Previously Communicated Fiscal Year 2011 Guidance
 
continuing operations for fiscal year 2011 are expected to increase 10 to 12 percent over adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified item, of $4.94 for fiscal year 2010. The specified item represents a 2010 non-cash charge of $0.04 cents per share related to healthcare reform impacting Medicare Part D reimbursements.
A conference call regarding BD's first quarter results and its expectations for the full fiscal year 2011 will be broadcast live on BD's website, , along with related slides, at 10:00 a.m. (ET) Tuesday, February 8, 2011.

our products and services, or our suppliers' ability to provide products needed for our operations; changes in interest or foreign currency exchange rates; competitive factors; pricing and market share pressures; difficulties inherent in product development and delays in product introductions; increases in energy costs and their effect on, among other things, the cost of producing BD's products; fluctuations in costs and availability of raw materials and in BD's ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships; new or changing laws impacting our business or changes in enforcement practices with respect to such laws; uncertainties of litigation (as described in BD's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission); future healthcare reform, including changes in government pricing and reimbursement policies or other cost containment reforms; the effects of potential pandemic diseases; our ability to successfully integrate any businesses we acquire; and issuance of new or revised accounting standards, as well as other factors discussed in BD's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX), a leading global medical technology company, today reported quarterly revenues of $1.922 billion for the second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2011, representing an increase of 6.8 percent from the prior-year period. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, revenue increased 4.6 percent, despite an unfavorable comparison to the prior year of about 2.3 percentage points due to strong sales related to the H1N1 flu pandemic, supplemental spending in Japan and stimulus spending in the U.S. in fiscal year 2010.
Franklin Lakes, NJ (April 26, 2011)
"We are pleased with our solid results this quarter, which were in line with our expectations," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We continued the increased pace of our R&D spending and made strategic investments, such as our acquisition of Accuri Cytometers, demonstrating our commitment to driving revenue growth through innovation."
Update on Impact of Japan Earthquake and Tsunami
Order volumes for BD products in Japan have now returned to normal levels. The Company's manufacturing plant in Fukushima sustained some earthquake-related damage, but the prepared plated media manufacturing lines were recently restarted, and manufacturing of BD Hypak Prefillable Syringes is expected to resume during the third fiscal quarter 2011. BD's Fukushima distribution center and an additional distribution center near Tokyo are in operation. The unfavorable impact of these events on the Company's revenues in the second fiscal quarter was less than $10 million. For the full fiscal year 2011, the Company anticipates these events to have an aggregate unfavorable impact of $10 to $20 million on revenues, or about $0.05 per share, which has been incorporated into its fiscal year 2011 guidance.

The financial impact of the acquisition on fiscal year 2011 earnings has been incorporated into the Company's previously disclosed guidance.

Second Quarter and Six-Month Fiscal 2011 Operating Results
Reported diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.38, compared with $1.18 in the prior-year period, representing a 16.9 percent increase. The prior-year period included a non-cash charge of $8.9 million, or $0.04 per share, related to healthcare reform impacting Medicare Part D reimbursements. Excluding that item, earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 13.1 percent, compared with adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.22 in the prior-year period, or 7.4 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
For the six-month period ending March 31, 2011, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.72, compared with $2.43 in the prior-year period. Excluding the aforementioned charge, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 10.1 percent, compared with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.47 in the prior-year period, or 5.3 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $981 million, representing an increase of 6.5 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 4.9 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Revenues reflected strong sales of Diabetes Care and Pharmaceutical Systems products. The segment's revenues also reflected an unfavorable comparison to the prior year of about 1.6 percentage points due to strong sales related to the H1N1 flu pandemic in fiscal year 2010. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2011, BD Medical revenues increased 0.8 percent, or 0.1 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $605 million, representing an increase of 8.9 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 6.5 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Revenues reflected solid growth in Preanalytical Systems safety-engineered products and strong growth in Diagnostic Systems infectious disease platforms. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2011, BD Diagnostics revenues increased 4.9 percent, or 3.6 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $335 million, representing an increase of 4.1 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 0.4 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Segment revenue growth was negatively impacted by about 12 percentage points due to certain factors. About 8 percentage points of the impact was due to an unfavorable comparison resulting from strong sales related to supplemental spending in Japan and stimulus spending in the U.S. in fiscal year 2010, and about 3 percentage points resulted from the effects of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Segment growth was driven primarily by instrument and reagent sales in the Cell Analysis unit. Discovery Labware revenues in the U.S. were negatively impacted by weakness in core consumables due to lower pharmaceutical spending and academic sector sales. For the six-month
2
 
period ended March 31, 2011, BD Biosciences revenues increased by 3.9 percent, or 1.9 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Geographic Results
Second quarter revenues in the U.S. were $829 million, representing an increase of 4.7 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $1.093 billion, representing an increase of 8.5 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 4.6 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Revenues reflected continued strength in emerging markets, which was partially offset by weakened demand in Western Europe due to challenging macroeconomic conditions. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2011, revenues in the U.S. were $1.658 billion, representing an increase of 0.8 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $2.106 billion, representing an increase of 4.1 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 2.1 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Fiscal Year 2011 Outlook
The Company is raising its reported revenue guidance for the full fiscal year 2011 to an increase of approximately 5 to 6 percent compared with fiscal year 2010, due to an expected favorable currency impact. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, the Company is lowering its revenue guidance to an increase of about 3.5 percent versus its previous guidance of about 4 percent, mainly due to lower than expected sales in Western Europe.
The Company is raising its previous guidance for reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2011 by about $0.10 per share to a range of $5.55 to $5.65, an increase of approximately 13 to 15 percent over fiscal year 2010. This revised guidance reflects the anticipated effects of favorable currency and operating efficiencies, partially offset by higher resin costs and the negative impact of the Japan earthquake and tsunami. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2011 are expected to increase 12 to 14 percent over adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.94, excluding the specified item, for fiscal year 2010. The specified item represents the aforementioned 2010 non-cash charge of $0.04 per share related to healthcare reform. On a currency-neutral basis, the Company expects diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to increase about 10 percent over adjusted diluted earnings per share in the prior-year period.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: July 29, 2011
 

Exhibit 3.1
     The registered office of Becton, Dickinson and Company (the "Company") shall be in the Borough of Franklin Lakes, County of Bergen, State of New Jersey or such other place within or without the State of New Jersey as the Board of Directors may designate. The Company may also establish and have such other offices within or without the State of New Jersey, as the Board of Directors may designate or its business may require.
     SECTION 1. PLACE OF MEETINGS. Meetings of the shareholders shall be held at the registered office of the Company in New Jersey, or at such other place, within or without the State of New Jersey, as may be designated by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting.
     SECTION 2.A. ANNUAL MEETINGS. The annual meeting of shareholders for the election of Directors and the transaction of such other business as may be related to the purposes set forth in the notice of the meeting shall be held at such time as may be fixed by the Board of Directors.
     B. SPECIAL MEETING FOR ELECTION OF DIRECTORS. If the annual meeting of shareholders is not held on the date designated, the Board of Directors may call a special meeting of the shareholders for the election of Directors and the transaction of other business.
     C. SPECIAL MEETINGS. (a) Special meetings of the shareholders may be called by the Board of Directors or by the Chairman of the Board or by the Chief Executive Officer or by the President, and shall be called by the Chairman of the Board or by the Chief Executive Officer or by the President upon written request of a majority of the Directors then in office, which request shall state the time, place and purpose of the meeting. Subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.C, a special meeting of shareholders shall be called by the Secretary at the written request (a "Special Meeting Request") of holders of record of at least 25% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company entitled to vote on the matter or matters to be brought before the proposed special meeting. Such Special Meeting Request must be made in proper written form as specified in subsection (b) of this Section 2.C. This Section 2.C is the exclusive means by which a shareholder may nominate persons for election to the Board of Directors and/or present other business at a special meeting of shareholders.
 
     (b) A Special Meeting Request to the Secretary must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Company, and shall be signed by each shareholder, or a duly authorized agent of such shareholder, requesting the special meeting. To be in proper written form, a Special Meeting Request must set forth (i) all the information required under subsection (c)(i) and/or (ii) of Article II, Section 2.D of these By-Laws, as applicable, with respect to the nominations or other business proposed to be brought before such special meeting; (ii) all of the information required to be set forth in a shareholder's notice under subsections (c)(iii) through (ix) of Article II, Section 2.D of these By-Laws with respect to each shareholder requesting such meeting; (iii) all information relating to each such shareholder that would be required to be disclosed in connection with the shareholder's solicitation of proxies for the election of directors in an election contest (even if an election contest is not involved), and all information, whether or not relating to such shareholder, that would otherwise be required in connection with the shareholder's solicitation of proxies with respect to the matters proposed to be acted upon at the meeting, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and (iv) an acknowledgment by such shareholder that any disposition of shares of common stock of the Company held of record by such shareholder as of the date of delivery of the Special Meeting Request and prior to the record date for the special meeting of shareholders requested by such shareholder shall constitute a revocation of such request with respect to such shares.
     (c) The Secretary shall (as promptly as practicable but in no event more than ten days following delivery of a Special Meeting Request that complies with subsection (b) of this Section 2.C) determine whether the request has been made by shareholders owning and holding, in the aggregate, the number of shares necessary to request a special meeting pursuant to this Section 2.C. Upon the Secretary's finding that holders of the requisite number of shares have made the request, the Board shall determine (as promptly as practicable but in no event more than ten days following the date of the Secretary's finding), with the advice of counsel, whether the request is valid under the criteria set forth in subsection (d) of this Section 2.C, and if the request is determined to be valid shall proceed to fix a date, time and place for the meeting, which date shall be not more than 90 days after the receipt of the Special Meeting Request. Subject to the preceding sentence, in fixing a date and time for a special meeting pursuant to a Special Meeting Request, the Board of Directors may consider such factors as it deems relevant within the good faith exercise of business judgment, including, without limitation, the nature of the matters to be considered, the facts and circumstances surrounding any request for meeting and any plan of the Board of Directors to call an annual meeting or a special meeting, and nothing herein will limit the power of the Board of Directors or the chair appointed for any annual or special meeting in respect of the conduct of any such meeting.
     (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.C, a special meeting requested by shareholders shall not be held if: (i) an annual or special meeting of shareholders that included an identical or substantially similar item of business ("Similar Business") (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) was held not more than 120 days before the Special Meeting Request was received by the Secretary; (ii) the Board of Directors has called or calls for an annual or special meeting of shareholders to be held within 90 days after the Special Meeting Request is received by the Secretary and the Board of Directors determines in good faith that the business to be conducted at such
 
meeting includes the Similar Business. For purposes of this Section 2.C, the election of directors shall be deemed to be Similar Business with respect to all items of business involving the election or removal of directors, changing the size of the Board of Directors and filling of vacancies and/or newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors; or (iii) the Special Meeting Request relates to an item of business that is not a proper subject for shareholder action under applicable law.
     (e) A shareholder may revoke a Special Meeting Request at any time by written revocation delivered to the Secretary, and if, following such revocation, there are outstanding un-revoked requests from shareholders holding less than the requisite number of shares of common stock entitling such shareholders to request the calling of a special meeting in accordance with this Section 2.C, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion, cancel the special meeting. If none of the shareholders who submitted the Special Meeting Request appears or sends a duly authorized agent to present the business to be presented for consideration that was specified in the Special Meeting Request, the Company need not present such business for a vote at such special meeting.
     (f) Business conducted at a special meeting requested by shareholders shall be limited to the matters described in the applicable Special Meeting Request and set forth in the applicable notice of meeting, provided that nothing herein shall prohibit the Board of Directors from submitting additional matters to the shareholders at any such special meeting requested by shareholders.
     D. (a) ADVANCE NOTICE OF NOMINATIONS AND BUSINESS TO BE TRANSACTED AT ANNUAL MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS. No business may be transacted and no nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at an annual meeting of shareholders, other than business and nominations that are either: (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof); (ii) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof); or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by any shareholder of the Company (1) who is a shareholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 2.D. and on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote at such annual meeting, and (2) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.D.
     (b) . In addition to any other applicable requirements, for any business or nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder under subsection 2.D(a)(iii) above, such shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the Company. To be timely, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Company not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders; , , that in the event that the annual meeting is called for on a date that is not within 30 days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder in order to be timely must be so received not earlier than the 120 day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90 day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which

     Notwithstanding anything in the first sentence of the preceding paragraph to the contrary, in the event that the number of Directors to be elected to the Board of Directors is increased and there is no notice or public disclosure by the Company naming all of the nominees for Director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least 70 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders, a shareholder's notice required by this Section 2.D. shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made.

     (vii) a representation that the shareholder will notify the Company in writing of any such agreement, arrangement or understanding referenced in clause (vi) above (including any amendment or modification thereto) in effect as of the record date for the annual meeting promptly following the later of the record date or the date notice of the record date is first publicly disclosed;

In addition, only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.D shall be eligible to be elected at an annual meeting of the Company. If the chairman of an annual meeting determines that such business or nomination was not properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the chairman shall declare to the meeting that such business or nomination was not properly brought before the meeting, and such business shall not be transacted or such defective nomination shall be disregarded.

     SECTION 3. QUORUM; ADJOURNMENT. The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of shares representing a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at a meeting shall constitute a quorum. If a quorum is not present at any meeting, the chairman of the meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time without notice, other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present; that if after adjournment the Board of Directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record on the new record date entitled to vote. The shareholders present in person or by proxy at a duly organized meeting may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of
provided
 
enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum. The chairman of the meeting or a majority of the shareholders present in person, or by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting without notice. At such adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.
     SECTION 4. NOTICE OF MEETINGS. A written notice of each annual or special meeting of the shareholders of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer or the President or the Secretary, which shall state the time, place and purpose of such meeting, shall be given not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days before the date of any such meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, the notice shall be directed to the shareholder at his or her address as it appears on the records of the stock transfer agent. Any shareholder, in person or by proxy, may at any time by a duly signed statement in writing to that effect, waive any statutory or other notice of any meeting, whether such statement be signed before or after such meeting.
     SECTION 5. VOTING. (a) . At all meetings of the shareholders, each holder of common stock having the right to vote, and present at the meeting in person or by proxy, shall be entitled to one vote for each full share of common stock of the Company entitled to vote and registered in his or her name. Each holder of preferred stock of any series shall have such voting powers, if any, as the Board of Directors shall have fixed by resolution prior to the issuance of any shares of such series. Whenever any action is to be taken by vote of the shareholders, other than the election of Directors, it shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of the shareholders by the holders of shares entitled to vote, unless a greater plurality is required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation.
General
     (b) . Except as otherwise required by law, a nominee for director shall be elected at a meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present if the number of votes cast, in person or by proxy by the holders of shares entitled to vote thereon, "for" such nominee's election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" such nominee's election; provided, that if the number of director nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, a nominee shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, in person or by proxy, by the holders of shares entitled to vote thereon at any such meeting. Any incumbent director who is not elected at such meeting shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the offer to resign, or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors will act on such recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results.
Election of Directors
     SECTION 6. PROXIES. Any shareholder of record entitled to vote may be represented at any annual or special meeting of the shareholders by a duly appointed proxy. All proxies shall be filed with the Secretary of the meeting before being voted.
     SECTION 7. ORGANIZATION. The Chairman of the Board, or in the absence or disability of the Chairman of the Board or if a vacancy exists in the office of Chairman of the Board, a director or officer designated by the Board of Directors shall act as
 
chairman of the meeting at all meetings of the shareholders. The Secretary, or in his or her absence or disability one of the Assistant Secretaries, shall act as secretary of the meeting. In case none of the officers above designated to act as secretary of the meeting shall be present, a secretary of the meeting shall be chosen by the Board of Directors.
     SECTION 8. ORDER OF BUSINESS. The order of business at all meetings of the shareholders shall be as determined by the chairman of the meeting, but the order of business to be followed at any meeting at which a quorum is present may be changed by a vote of the shareholders.
     SECTION 9. RECORD DATE FOR ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT. In order that the Company may determine the shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting in accordance with law, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than 60 days before the date fixed by the Board of Directors for tabulation of the consents or, if no date has been fixed for tabulation, more than 60 days before the last day on which consents received may be counted. When no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, any shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within 30 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within 30 days after the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Company by delivery to its registered office in New Jersey, its principal place of business or to any officer or agent of the Company having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Company's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
Nothing in this Article II, Section 9 shall require the Board of Directors to take any action with respect to any proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought other than to fix a record date as provided for herein; and the fixing of any such record date shall not be deemed to be an action taken by the Board of Directors with respect to any such proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought for any other purpose.
     SECTION 10. INSPECTORS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by Article II, Section 9, to the Company of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Company shall engage nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of the

For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Company that the consents delivered to the Company in accordance with Article II, Section 9 represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any shareholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
     SECTION 11. EFFECTIVENESS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each shareholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, on or before the date fixed by the Board of Directors for tabulation of the consents or, if no such date has been fixed, within 60 days of the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with Article II, Section 9, a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to the Company in the manner prescribed in Article II, Section 9 and are not thereafter revoked in accordance with the New Jersey Business Corporation Act.

A new certificate may be issued without requiring any bond when, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, it is proper to do so.
     SECTION 4. TRANSFER AGENT AND REGISTRAR. The Board of Directors may appoint one or more transfer agents and one or more registrars, and may require all certificates of capital stock to bear the signature or signatures of any of them.

     Any Director or corporate officer may be a party to or may be interested in any agreement or transaction of the Company by which he or she may personally benefit, with the same force and effect as if he or she were either an entire stranger to the Company or to the Board of Directors, provided the fact that he or she is so interested or may personally benefit shall be disclosed or shall have been known to the majority of the Board of Directors; and further provided that such agreement or transaction shall be approved or ratified by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Directors, or a committee thereof, not so interested or benefited.

"This change in leadership is the result of the Board's focus on succession planning that began in 2008 as part of our corporate governance practices," said Henry P. Becton, Jr., BD's Lead Director.

ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On August 2, 2011, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for its third fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2011. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP measures"), as follows:
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.
 
ITEM 9.01 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX), a leading global medical technology company, today reported quarterly revenues of $2.014 billion for the third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2011, representing an increase of 10.0 percent from the prior-year period. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, revenues increased 4.8 percent.
Franklin Lakes, NJ (August 2, 2011)
"We are pleased with our solid results this quarter, with all three segments contributing to growth," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Gross margin expansion reflecting favorable product mix has offset some of the headwinds we have been facing as a result of a challenging macroeconomic environment and increased raw material costs."

Agreement to Acquire Carmel Pharma, AB
On July 27, 2011, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Carmel Pharma, AB, a Swedish company that manufactures the PhaSeal System. This is the leading closed-system drug transfer device for the safe handling of hazardous drugs that are packaged in vials. The acquisition is expected to close prior to the end of this fiscal year.
Third Quarter and Nine-Month Fiscal 2011 Operating Results
Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter were $1.51, compared with $1.23 in the prior-year period, representing a 22.8 percent increase, or 13.8 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
For the nine-month period ending June 30, 2011, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $4.23, compared with $3.66 in the prior-year period. The prior-year period included a non-cash charge of $8.9 million, or $0.04 per share, related to healthcare reform impacting Medicare Part D reimbursements. Excluding that item, earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 14.3 percent, compared with adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $3.70 in the prior-year period, or 8.1 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $1.045 billion, representing an increase of 10.5 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 4.9 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Revenues reflected strong sales of Pharmaceutical Systems products and international
2
 
safety, along with solid sales of Diabetes Care products. For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2011, BD Medical revenues increased 4.0 percent, or 1.7 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $631 million, representing an increase of 9.6 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 4.8 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Revenues reflected solid growth in Preanalytical Systems safety-engineered products and strong growth in both the Women's Health and Cancer and the Infectious Disease product offerings in the Diagnostics Systems unit. For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2011, BD Diagnostics revenues increased 6.4 percent, or 3.9 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $338 million, representing an increase of 9.3 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 4.3 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Segment growth was driven primarily by instrument and reagent sales in the Cell Analysis unit. Discovery Labware revenues in the U.S. were negatively impacted by weakness in core consumables. The segment's revenues also reflected softness in Western Europe due to government research funding delays. For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2011, BD Biosciences revenues increased by 5.7 percent, or 2.7 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Geographic Results
Third quarter revenues in the U.S. were $855 million, representing an increase of 5.7 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $1.159 billion, representing an increase of 13.4 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 4.1 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Revenues reflected continued strength in emerging markets, which was partially offset
3
 
by ongoing challenging macroeconomic conditions in Western Europe. For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2011, revenues in the U.S. were $2.513 billion, representing an increase of 2.4 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $3.265 billion, representing an increase of 7.2 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 2.8 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Fiscal Year 2011 Outlook
Reported revenue growth guidance for the full fiscal year 2011 is expected to be at the higher end of the previously communicated range of 5 to 6 percent compared with fiscal year 2010, due to the anticipated effects of favorable currency. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, the Company is lowering its revenue growth guidance to an increase of about 3 percent versus its previously communicated guidance of about 3.5 percent, mainly due to lower than expected sales in Western Europe.
The Company is raising its previous guidance for reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2011 from $5.55-$5.65 to $5.65-$5.70, an increase of approximately 15 to 16 percent over fiscal year 2010, due to the anticipated effects of favorable currency. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2011 are expected to increase 14 to 15 percent over adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.94, excluding the specified item, for fiscal year 2010. The specified item represents the aforementioned 2010 non-cash charge of $0.04 per share related to healthcare reform. On a currency-neutral basis, the Company continues to expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to increase about 10 percent over adjusted diluted earnings per share in the prior-year period, despite lower than expected revenue growth and higher resin costs.

ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On November 2, 2011, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ending September 30, 2011. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP measures"), as follows:
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.

 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX), a leading global medical technology company, today reported quarterly revenues of $2.051 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2011, representing an increase of 9.5 percent from the prior-year period, or 4.0 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Franklin Lakes, NJ (November 2, 2011)
For the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, BD reported revenues of $7.829 billion, representing an increase of 6.2 percent over the prior year. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, revenues increased 2.9 percent, despite an unfavorable comparison to the prior year of about 2.0 percentage points due to strong sales related to the H1N1 flu pandemic, supplemental spending in Japan and stimulus spending in the U.S. in fiscal year 2010.
 
 
"We are pleased with our solid finish to fiscal year 2011. Despite a challenging business environment, all segments contributed to our success and growth," said Vincent A. Forlenza, Chief Executive Officer and President. "We will continue to drive operational efficiencies and make capital and R&D investments to support our innovation strategy as we look to fiscal year 2012 and beyond."
 
As announced in August 2011, the Company completed the acquisition of Carmel Pharma, AB, a Swedish company that manufactures the BD PhaSeal System. This is the leading closed-system drug transfer device for the safe handling of hazardous drugs that are packaged in vials. The financial impact of the acquisition on our fourth quarter results was in line with our guidance.
Update on the Acquisition of Carmel Pharma, AB
 
Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter were $1.36, compared with $1.24 in the prior-year period, representing a 9.7 percent increase. Current quarter results included a non-cash charge of $9 million, or $0.03 per share from continuing operations, resulting from the discontinuance of a research program within the Diagnostic Systems unit. Excluding this item, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 12.1 percent to $1.39, compared with $1.24 in the prior-year period. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter increased by 8.1 percent.
Fourth Quarter Earnings and Analysis of the Full Fiscal Year 2011 and 2010 Earnings
For the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $5.59, compared with $4.90 in the prior fiscal year, representing an increase of 14.1
 
percent. Excluding the aforementioned charge of $9 million, or $0.03 per share from continuing operations, and the 2010 fiscal year charge of $0.04 per share from continuing operations related to healthcare reform impacting Medicare Part D reimbursements, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 13.8 percent to $5.62, compared with $4.94 in the prior-year period. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fiscal year increased 8.1 percent.
 
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $1.055 billion, representing an increase of 10.0 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues increased 3.8 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Segment revenue growth reflected strong Diabetes Care and international safety sales, along with solid sales of Pharmaceutical Systems products. For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2011, BD Medical revenues increased 5.6 percent, or 2.3 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Segment Results
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $642 million, representing an increase of 8.6 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 3.8 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Revenues reflected solid growth in both the Women's Health and Cancer and the Infectious Disease product offerings within the Diagnostic Systems unit. For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2011, BD Diagnostics revenues increased 7.0 percent, or 3.9 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
 
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $354 million, representing an increase of 9.6 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues increased 4.7 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis, primarily driven by instrument and reagent sales in the Cell Analysis unit. For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2011, BD Biosciences revenues increased 6.7 percent, or 3.2 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
 
Fourth quarter revenues in the U.S. were $843 million, representing an increase of 1.3 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $1.208 billion, representing an increase of 16.0 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 6.1 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. International revenue growth was driven by continued strength in safety sales and strong growth in emerging markets. For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2011, revenues in the U.S. were $3.356 billion, representing an increase of 2.1 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $4.473 billion, representing an increase of 9.5 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 3.6 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Geographic Results
 
The Company estimates that reported revenues for the full fiscal year 2012 will increase about 1 to 3 percent, or 2 to 4 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Our guidance reflects the anticipated effects of lower healthcare utilization, reduced research funding and global macroeconomic conditions. The Company expects reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2012 to be between $5.75 and $5.85. The Company also plans to repurchase, subject to
Fiscal 2012 Outlook for Full Year
 
market conditions, $1.5 billion of its common stock in fiscal year 2012, and fund the repurchases through ongoing cash flow and the issuance of debt.

(i) or (ii), is in your judgment so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus;
     (f) On or after the Applicable Time (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities;

     (h) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to you at the Time of Delivery certificates of officers of the Company reasonably satisfactory to you as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such time, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such time, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (e) of this Section and as to such other matters as you may reasonably request.
     9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
 
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter expressly for use therein.
     (b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the
 
indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party) provided that in the event of such assumption the action may not be compromised or settled by the indemnifying party without the consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. After notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. The indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party pursuant to the provisions of this Section 9 in respect of any action compromised or settled by the indemnified party, unless the written consent of the indemnifying party shall have been obtained to such compromise or settlement (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata
 
allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
     (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
     10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be
 
made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate if so decided by the Company upon notice to the Underwriters pursuant to Section 13 hereunder, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default
     11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
     12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the
 
Company will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out of pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
     13. In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of the Underwriters made or given by you as the Representatives.
     All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to you as the Representatives in care of Goldman, Sachs & Co., 200 West Street, New York, New York 10282-2198, Attention: Registration Department and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, 1858 Broadway, 29th Floor, New York, New York 10036, Attention: Investment Banking Division (Fax: 212-507-8999); and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by you upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
     In accordance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the underwriters are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their respective clients, including the Company, which information may include the name and address of their respective clients, as well as other information that will allow the underwriters to properly identify their respective clients.
     14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
 
     15. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
     16. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
     17. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
     18. 
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
     19. The Company and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
     20. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
     21. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company is authorized to disclose to any persons the U.S. federal and state income tax treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Company relating to that treatment and structure, without the Underwriters imposing any limitation of any kind. However, any information relating to the tax treatment and tax structure shall remain confidential (and the foregoing sentence shall not
 
apply) to the extent necessary to enable any person to comply with securities laws. For this purpose, "tax structure" is limited to any facts that may be relevant to that treatment.
 
     If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us four counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by you, on behalf of each of the Underwriters, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between each of the Underwriters and the Company. It is understood that your acceptance of this letter on behalf of each of the Underwriters is pursuant to the authority set forth in a form of Agreement among Underwriters, the form of which shall be submitted to the Company for examination upon request, but without warranty on your part as to the authority of the signers thereof.
 
Acting severally on behalf of themselves and as Representatives of the several Underwriters named in Schedule 1 hereto.

     3. The statements made in each of the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Debt Securities" and "Description of Notes" (including, in the case of the Pricing Disclosure Package, the information set forth in the Free Writing Prospectus) insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of certain terms of documents referred to therein, constitute accurate summaries of the terms of such documents in all material respects.
     4. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
     5. No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any federal or New York State governmental agency or body or, to such counsel's knowledge, any federal or New York State court is required for the issue and sale of the Notes by the Company, and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, except for the registration under the Securities Act of the Notes, and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Notes by the Underwriters.
     6. The Registration Statement became effective under the Securities Act upon filing of the Registration Statement with the Commission on May 8, 2009 and the Prospectus was filed on November 3, 2011 pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Securities Act and, to such counsel's knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued or proceeding for that purpose has been instituted or threatened by the Commission.
     7. (i) the Registration Statement, as of the date it first became effective under the Securities Act, and the Prospectus, as of November 3, 2011, appeared, on their face, to be appropriately responsive, in all material respects, to the requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, except that in each case such counsel expresses no view with respect to
 
the financial statements or other financial or accounting data contained in, incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference in, or omitted from the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents; and (ii) nothing has come to such counsel's attention that causes such counsel to believe that (a) the Registration Statement (including the Exchange Act Documents incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference therein and the Prospectus deemed to be a part thereof), as of November 3, 2011, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, (b) the Pricing Disclosure Package (including the Exchange Act Documents incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference therein), as of the time of the pricing of the offering of the Notes on November 3, 2011, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (c) the Prospectus (including the Exchange Act Documents incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference therein), as of November 3, 2011 or as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that such counsel expresses no belief in any of clauses (a), (b) or (c) above with respect to the financial statements or other financial or accounting data contained in, incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference in, or omitted from the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents.
     Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to or are dependent upon matters governed by the law of the State of New Jersey, such counsel has relied upon the opinions of Jeffrey S. Sherman and Gary DeFazio for the Company. Such counsel does not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the law of the State of New York and the federal law of the United States and, on the basis set forth in the preceding paragraph, the law of the State of New Jersey. All capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed in such counsel's opinion letter.

This Note is one of a series designated as the 1.750% Notes due November 8, 2016 (the "Notes") limited in aggregate principal amount to $500,000,000 (except as in the Indenture provided). The Company may, from time to time, without the consent of the existing holders of the Notes, issue additional notes under the Indenture having the same terms as the Notes in all respects, except for issue date, issue price and the initial interest payment date. Any such additional notes will be consolidated with and form a single series with the Notes. Terms defined in the Indenture have the same definitions herein unless otherwise specified.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities of any series, on behalf of the holders of all the Securities of such series, to waive certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by or on behalf of the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note or such other Note.
 
     Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Company may elect either (i) to defease and be discharged from any and all obligations with respect to the Notes or (ii) to be released from its obligations with respect to certain covenants applicable to the Notes, upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to this Note.

     The Notes are redeemable as a whole or in part at the option of the Company at any time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (2) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments on the Notes, discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis, assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at the Treasury Rate plus 15 basis points, plus in each case, accrued interest to the date of redemption on the principal balance of the Notes being redeemed. For the purposes hereof:
     "Treasury Rate" means, for any redemption date, the annual rate equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue equal to the Comparable Treasury Price, expressed as a percentage of its principal amount, for such redemption date.

     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker that would be used, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the applicable remaining term of the Notes being redeemed.

     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation" means, with respect to any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury
 
Issue, expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount, quoted in writing to the Trustee by a Reference Treasury Dealer as of 3:30 p.m., New York time, on the third business day preceding that redemption date. The Trustee shall seek Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations in respect of any redemption date from each of the then-existing Reference Treasury Dealers.
     "Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to each note being redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on that Note that would be due after the related redemption date but for the redemption; , , that if the redemption date is not an interest payment date with respect to that Note, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment on that Note that would have been due will be deemed reduced by the amount of interest accrued on the Note to the redemption date.

On and after any redemption date, the Notes or any portion of the Notes called for redemption will stop accruing interest. On or before any redemption date, the Company will deposit with the paying agent or the Trustee money sufficient to pay the accrued interest on the Notes to be redeemed and their redemption price. If less than all of the Notes are redeemed, the Trustee will choose the Notes to be redeemed by any method that it deems fair and appropriate.
     Upon the presentment for registration of transfer of this Note at the office or agency of the Company designated for such purpose pursuant to the Indenture, a new Note or Notes of authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor, subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.
     Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note, the Company, the Trustee or any Note registrar, co-registrar, paying agent or authenticating agent, may deem and treat the registered holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Note (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon), for the purpose of receiving payment hereof, or on account hereof, and for all other purposes, and the Company, the Trustee and any Note registrar, co-registrar, paying agent and authenticating agent shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as counsel to Becton, Dickinson and Company, a New Jersey corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-159102) (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), relating to the issuance by the Company of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 1.750% Notes due 2016 (the "2016 Notes") and $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 3.125% Notes due 2021 (the "2021 Notes", and together with the 2016 Notes, the "Notes"). The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to the Prospectus, dated May 8, 2009, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, dated November 3, 2011 (together, the "Prospectus"), filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2) under the Securities Act, and an Underwriting Agreement dated November 3, 2011 (the "Underwriting Agreement") between the Company and the several underwriters named therein.
 
     The Notes will be issued under an indenture dated as of March 1, 1997 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee").
     We have examined the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Indenture, which has been filed with the Commission as an exhibit to the Registration Statement. We also have examined the originals, or duplicates or certified or conformed copies, of such records, agreements, documents and other instruments and have made such other investigations as we have deemed relevant and necessary in connection with the opinions hereinafter set forth. As to questions of fact material to this opinion, we have relied upon certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company.
     In rendering the opinion set forth below, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as duplicates or certified or conformed copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. We also have assumed that the Indenture is the valid and legally binding obligation of the Trustee.
     We have assumed further that (1) the Company has duly authorized, executed and delivered the Indenture in accordance with the law of New Jersey and (2) the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Indenture and the Notes do not and will not violate the law of New Jersey.
     Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications, assumptions and limitations stated herein, we are of the opinion that, assuming the due execution, authentication, issuance and delivery of the Notes, upon payment of the consideration therefor provided for in the
 
Underwriting Agreement and otherwise in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement, the Notes will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
     Our opinion set forth above is subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (iii) an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

     In connection with the furnishing of this opinion, I have examined (a) copies of the Registration Statement and of the Prospectus, and (b) a copy of the Indenture, dated as of March 1, 1997, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A.

ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On February 7, 2012, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for its first fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2011. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP measures"), as follows:
 
 
 
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.

 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX), a leading global medical technology company, today reported quarterly revenues of $1.888 billion for the first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2011, representing an increase of 2.5 percent from the prior-year period, or 2.4 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Franklin Lakes, NJ (February 7, 2012)
"We are pleased with our solid start to fiscal year 2012 given the challenging macroeconomic climate," said Vincent A. Forlenza, Chief Executive Officer and President. "Our operating results reflect our increased investments in high-growth areas. We will continue to drive efficiency throughout the Company and we remain committed to delivering value to our customers and shareholders."
First Quarter Earnings
As expected, reported diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.21, compared with $1.35 in the prior-year period, representing a 10.4 percent decrease. This decline was due to difficult pricing comparisons, higher raw material costs and higher expenses from recent acquisitions. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, diluted earnings per share for the first quarter decreased by 9.6 percent. For the quarter, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations included an approximate $0.04 tax benefit primarily relating to various tax settlements in multiple jurisdictions. This benefit was reflected in our previous full fiscal year 2012 guidance.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $950 million, representing an increase of 2.6 percent compared with the prior-year period, on both a reported and a currency-neutral basis. The segment's revenue growth reflects solid sales in the Diabetes Care unit and international safety-engineered products.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $621 million, representing an increase of 3.2 percent compared with the prior-year period, or an increase of 3.3 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. The segment's growth was primarily driven by Preanalytical Systems safety-engineered products, and solid sales in Women's Health and Cancer.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $317 million, representing an increase of 0.9 percent compared with the prior-year period, or an increase of 0.3 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Segment growth was primarily driven by clinical reagent sales in the Cell Analysis unit.
Geographic Results
First quarter revenues in the U.S. of $829 million were flat when compared with the prior-year period, due to a challenging research spending environment and difficult pricing comparisons. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $1.059 billion, representing an increase of 4.5 percent compared with the prior-year period, or an increase of 4.4 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. International revenues reflected continued strength in emerging markets and strong sales of safety-engineered products.
Fiscal 2012 Outlook for Full Year
We are reaffirming our previously communicated revenue growth guidance of 2 to 4 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. The Company estimates reported revenue growth for the full fiscal year 2012 to be about flat versus our previously disclosed revenue growth guidance of 1 to 3 percent. The Company expects reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2012 to be between $5.60 and $5.70 which reflects the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar versus our previously disclosed guidance of $5.75 to $5.85. The Company uses recent spot rates for all foreign currencies when projecting reported growth rates and earnings per share. In line with our previously disclosed guidance, the Company plans to repurchase, subject to market conditions, $1.5 billion of its common stock in fiscal year 2012.

The pilot-in-command shall have absolute discretion in all matters concerning preparation of the Aircraft for flight and the flight itself, the load carried and its distribution, the decision whether or not a flight shall be undertaken, the route to be flown, the place where landings shall be made, and all other matters relating to operation of the Aircraft. Mr. Forlenza specifically agrees that the flight crew shall have final and complete authority to delay or cancel any flight for any reason or condition that in the sole judgment of the pilot-in-command could compromise the safety of the flight, and to take any other action that in the sole judgment of the pilot-in-command is necessitated by considerations of safety. No such action of the pilot-in-command shall create or support any liability to Mr. Forlenza or any other person for loss, injury, damage or delay. The parties further agree that BD shall not be liable for delay or failure to furnish an Aircraft and crew pursuant to this Agreement when such failure is caused by government regulation or authority, mechanical difficulty or breakdown, war, civil commotion, strike or labor dispute, weather conditions, act of God, or other circumstances beyond BD's reasonable control.

ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On May 1, 2012, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for its second fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2012. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP measures"), as follows:
 
 
 
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.

BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX), a leading global medical technology company, today reported quarterly revenues of $1.991 billion for the second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2012, representing an increase of 3.6 percent from the prior-year period, or 4.6 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Franklin Lakes, NJ (May 1, 2012)
"We are very pleased with our second quarter results. We posted solid revenue growth led by our BD Medical and BD Diagnostics segments, despite continuing challenges in the U.S. in our BD Biosciences segment," said Vincent A. Forlenza, Chief Executive Officer and President. "We remain committed to our strategy of investing and innovating for growth, both organically and through acquisitions such as KIESTRA Lab Automation."
Agreement to Sell Discovery Labware Unit, Excluding Advanced Bioprocessing
In April 2012, the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell its BD Biosciences - Discovery Labware unit, excluding its Advanced Bioprocessing platform. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of calendar year 2012, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including consultations and regulatory approvals. For the full fiscal year 2012, revenues and earnings per share associated with this asset group are estimated at $235 million and $0.23 to $0.27, respectively. The Company expects to record a gain on the sale at the time the transaction is completed.
Second Quarter and Six-Month Fiscal 2012 Operating Results
As expected, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter were $1.38, or flat compared with the prior-year period. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter increased by 2.9 percent.
For the six-month period ending March 31, 2012, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.59, compared with $2.72 in the prior-year period. This represents a decrease of 4.8 percent, or 3.3 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $1.021 billion, representing an increase of 4.1 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 5.3 percent on a currency-neutral basis. The segment's revenue growth reflected strong sales in the Pharmaceutical Systems and Diabetes Care
units and solid sales in the Medical Surgical Systems unit. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2012, BD Medical revenues increased 3.3 percent, or 4.0 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $630 million, representing an increase of 4.1 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 5.0 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. The segment's growth was primarily driven by strong sales in the Preanalytical Systems unit and solid growth in Women's Health and Cancer. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2012, BD Diagnostics revenues increased 3.6 percent, or 4.1 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $340 million, representing an increase of 1.3 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 1.7 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Segment growth was primarily driven by clinical reagent sales in the Cell Analysis unit and strong emerging market sales as overall segment growth continues to be negatively affected by weakness in the U.S. research market. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2012, BD Biosciences revenues increased 1.1 percent, or 1.0 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
Geographic Results
Second quarter revenues in the U.S. were $848 million, representing an increase of 2.2 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $1.143 billion, representing an increase of 4.6 percent compared with the prior-year period, or an increase of 6.3 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. International revenues reflected continued strength in emerging markets and strong sales of safety-engineered products. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2012, revenues in the U.S. were $1.676 billion, representing an increase of 1.1 percent compared with
the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $2.202 billion, representing an increase of 4.5 percent when compared with the prior-year period, or 5.4 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Fiscal 2012 Outlook for Full Year
The Company is raising its previous guidance for reported revenue growth for the full fiscal year 2012 from about flat to be between 1 to 2 percent. This reflects the anticipated effects of favorable currency translation. On a currency-neutral basis, the Company is raising the lower end of its previous revenue growth guidance of 2 to 4 percent, to 3 to 4 percent. The Company is raising reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2012 from $5.60 to $5.70 to be between $5.68 and $5.73, and plans to repurchase, subject to market conditions, $1.5 billion of its common stock in fiscal year 2012.

On May 18, 2012, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") entered into a Five Year Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders named in the Credit Agreement. The description of the Credit Agreement provided below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full and complete terms contained in the Credit Agreement, which is included as an exhibit to this report. The Credit Agreement replaced our prior credit agreement described below under Item 1.02.
The Credit Agreement is a senior unsecured revolving credit facility that provides BD with $1 billion of financing and expires in May 2017. The credit facility provides that BD may, subject to additional commitments made by the lenders, access up to an additional $500 million of financing through the facility, for a maximum aggregate commitment under the facility of up to $1.5 billion. Borrowings under the credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes. Interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Agreement will be based on prevailing interest rates and BD's credit ratings, as described in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and affirmative and negative covenants, including a single financial covenant that requires BD to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio (ratio of earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization to interest expense) of not less than 5-to-1 for the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default (including non-payment of principal or interest and breaches of covenants). If any event of default occurs and is not cured within the applicable grace period, the outstanding loans under the facility may be accelerated by lenders holding a majority of the commitments under the Credit Agreement and the lenders' commitments under the Credit Agreement may be terminated.
 
Upon effectiveness of the Credit Agreement described under Item 1.01 above, BD terminated its prior $1 billion credit agreement, dated as of December 1, 2006 (the "Prior Credit Agreement"), by and among BD, Citicorp USA, Inc., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto. The material terms and conditions of the Prior Credit Agreement are substantially the same as those under the Credit Agreement described in Item 1.01, except that the Prior Credit Agreement did not contain provisions allowing for access to up to $500 million of additional financing. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Prior Credit Agreement.
 
The information set forth above under Item 1.01 of this report is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.
 
On May 22, 2012, Vincent A. Forlenza, Chief Executive Officer and President of BD, was elected to the additional role of Chairman of the Board, effective July 1, 2012. A copy of a press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.

If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to A Advances comprising such A Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate.

At the request of the Borrower, this opinion letter is, pursuant to Section 3.01(e) of the Credit Agreement, provided to you by me in my capacity as General Counsel of the Borrower and may not be relied upon by any Person for any purpose other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement without, in each instance, my prior written consent.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent (the ""), in connection with the Amended and Restated Five Year Credit Agreement, dated as of May 18, 2012 (the ""), among Becton, Dickinson and Company, a New Jersey corporation (the ""), and each of you. Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined.
Agent
Credit Agreement
Borrower
In that connection, we have reviewed originals or copies of the following documents:
 
 
The documents described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) are collectively referred to herein as the "."
Opinion Documents
We have also reviewed originals or copies of such other agreements and documents as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinion expressed below.
In our review of the Opinion Documents and other documents, we have assumed:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1) The Borrower is an entity duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization.
(2) The Borrower has full power to execute, deliver and perform, and has duly executed and delivered, the Opinion Documents.
(3) The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Opinion Documents have been duly authorized by all necessary action (corporate or otherwise) and do not:
(a) contravene its certificate or articles of incorporation, by-laws or other organizational documents;
(b) except with respect to Generally Applicable Law, violate any law, rule or regulation applicable to it; or
(c) result in any conflict with or breach of any agreement or document binding on it of which any addressee hereof has knowledge, has received notice or has reason to know.
(4) Except with respect to Generally Applicable Law, no authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body or (to the extent the same is required under any agreement or document binding on it of which an addressee hereof has knowledge, has received notice or has reason to know) any other third party is required for the due execution, delivery or performance by the Borrower of any Opinion Document or, if any such authorization, approval, action, notice or filing is required, it has been duly obtained, taken, given or made and is in full force and effect.
We have not independently established the validity of the foregoing assumptions.
"" means the federal law of the United States of America, and the law of the State of New York (including the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder or pursuant thereto), that a New York lawyer exercising customary professional diligence would reasonably be expected to recognize as being applicable to the Borrower, the Opinion Documents or the transactions governed by the Opinion Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing definition of Generally Applicable Law, the term "Generally Applicable Law" does not include any law, rule or regulation that is applicable to the Borrower, the Opinion Documents or such transactions solely because such law, rule or regulation is part of a regulatory regime applicable to the specific assets or business of any party to any of the Opinion Documents or any of its affiliates.
Generally Applicable Law
 
 
Based upon the foregoing and upon such other investigation as we have deemed necessary and subject to the qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that each Opinion Document is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms.
Our opinion expressed above is subject to the following qualifications:
(a) Our opinion is subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally (including without limitation all laws relating to fraudulent transfers).
(b) Our opinion is subject to the effect of general principles of equity, including without limitation concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
(c) We express no opinion with respect to the enforceability of indemnification provisions, or of release or exculpation provisions, contained in the Opinion Documents to the extent that enforcement thereof is contrary to public policy regarding the indemnification against or release or exculpation of criminal violations, intentional harm or violations of securities laws.
(d) Our opinion is limited to Generally Applicable Law.
(e) We express no opinion with respect to Section 8.08 of the Credit Agreement to the extent that such Section (i) implies that a federal court of the United States has subject matter jurisdiction or (ii) purports to grant any court exclusive jurisdiction.
A copy of this opinion letter may be delivered by any of you to any person that becomes a Lender in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Any such person may rely on the opinions expressed above as if this opinion letter were addressed and delivered to such person on the date hereof.
This opinion letter is rendered to you in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Opinion Documents. This opinion letter may not be relied upon by you or any person entitled to rely on this opinion pursuant to the preceding paragraph for any other purpose without our prior written consent.
This opinion letter speaks only as of the date hereof. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to advise you of any development or circumstance of any kind, including any change of law or fact, that may occur after the date of this opinion letter that might affect the opinions expressed herein.
Very truly yours,

In the antitrust class actions consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey under the caption "In re Hypodermic Products Antitrust Litigation," on June 5, 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed a decision of the District Court and ruled that the distributor plaintiffs, not the hospital plaintiffs, are direct purchasers entitled to pursue damages under the federal antitrust laws for certain sales of BD products. The previously reported settlement agreement entered into on April 27, 2009, by Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") and certain purchaser plaintiffs (including BD's distributors) was contingent on a ruling that the distributor plaintiffs are the direct purchasers entitled to pursue damages. The agreement provided for, among other things, the payment by BD of $45 million in exchange for a release by all potential class members of the direct purchaser claims under federal antitrust laws related to the products and acts enumerated in the complaint, and a dismissal of the case with prejudice, insofar as it relates to direct purchaser claims. The release would not cover potential class members that affirmatively opt out of the settlement. The settlement agreement remains in effect, subject to certain termination provisions, and must be approved by the district court.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On August 2, 2012, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for its third fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2012. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP measures"), as follows:
 
 
 
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.

 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX), a leading global medical technology company, today reported quarterly revenues of $1.981 billion for the third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2012, representing an increase of 1.5 percent from the prior-year period, or 4.9 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Franklin Lakes, NJ (August 2, 2012)
"We are very pleased with our third quarter results," said Vincent A. Forlenza, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President. "As we anticipated, our revenue and earnings growth improved this quarter, demonstrating that our strategy implementation is on track and in line with our previously communicated expectations."
Update on Agreement to Sell Discovery Labware Unit, Excluding Advanced Bioprocessing
In April 2012, the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell its BD Biosciences - Discovery Labware unit, excluding its Advanced Bioprocessing platform. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of calendar year 2012, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including consultations and regulatory approvals. The results of operations associated with this disposal group have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all quarters and years referred to in this release.
As illustrated on page 3 of the attached financial tables, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $1.59 less the $0.07 from discontinued operations resulted in earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.52.
Also included for reference in the attached financial tables are the Company's Consolidated Income Statements reflecting the reclassification change of the Discovery Labware disposal group to discontinued operations, for the first two quarters of fiscal year 2012 and for all periods in fiscal year 2011.
Third Quarter and Nine-Month Fiscal 2012 Operating Results
Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter were $1.52, representing an increase of 5.6 percent over the prior-year period. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter increased by 9.7 percent.
For the nine-month period ending June 30, 2012, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $3.95, representing a decrease of 1.7 percent over the prior- year period. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 1.0 percent for this period.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $1.070 billion, representing an increase of 2.4 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 6.4 percent on a currency-neutral basis. The segment's revenue growth reflected strong sales and favorable comparisons in the Diabetes Care and Pharmaceutical Systems units. For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2012, BD Medical revenues increased 3.0 percent, or 4.8 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $642 million, representing an increase of 1.7 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 4.7 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. The segment's growth was primarily driven
by solid sales of Preanalytical Systems safety-engineered products and strong sales in the Women's Health and Cancer platform. For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2012, BD Diagnostics revenues increased 3.0 percent, or 4.3 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $268 million, representing a decrease of 2.7 percent compared with the prior-year period. On a currency-neutral basis, revenues increased by 0.2 percent. Segment results continue to be negatively affected by weakness in the U.S. research market. For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2012, BD Biosciences revenues increased 0.2 percent, or 1.3 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
Geographic Results
Third quarter revenues in the U.S. were $837 million, representing an increase of 1.1 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $1.144 billion, representing an increase of 1.7 percent compared with the prior-year period, or an increase of 7.8 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. International revenues reflected continued strength in emerging markets and strong sales of safety-engineered products. For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2012, revenues in the U.S. were $2.464 billion, representing an increase of 1.3 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $3.277 billion, representing an increase of 3.6 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 6.4 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Fiscal 2012 Outlook for Full Year
The Company expects reported revenue growth for the full fiscal year 2012 to be about 1 percent versus its previously disclosed guidance of 1 to 2 percent. This reflects the anticipated effects of unfavorable currency translation. On a currency-neutral basis, the Company is raising the lower end of its previously disclosed guidance of 3 to 4 percent to about 4 percent. The Company expects reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full fiscal year 2012 to be between $5.33 and $5.38. This reflects the reclassification of the Discovery Labware unit as discontinued operations and the anticipated effects of unfavorable currency translation. On a currency-neutral basis, the Company reaffirms its previously disclosed diluted earnings per share growth guidance of 4 to 5 percent, which includes the estimated impact of our recently announced agreement to acquire Safety Syringes, Inc.
Conference Call Information
A conference call regarding BD's third quarter results and its expectations for the full fiscal year 2012 will be broadcast live on BD's website, , along with related slides, at 8:00 a.m. (ET) Thursday August 2, 2012.

In a decision dated September 28, 2012, the District Court for the Southern District of California issued a decision on pre-trial summary judgment motions in . The court ruled that some of Gen-Probe's asserted patent claims are infringed, but other claims are not infringed, thus reducing from six to four the number of patents to be contested at the trial (which is scheduled to begin on December 4, 2012) and significant defense issues relating to patent invalidity, inequitable conduct and standing, remain to be adjudicated. This decision does not change the Company's views and it continues to believe that it has meritorious defenses to this litigation.

ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On November 7, 2012, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ending September 30, 2012. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP measures"), as follows:
 
 
We also present our diluted EPS for fiscal year 2011 after eliminating the non-cash charge resulting from the discontinuance of a research program within our Diagnostic Systems unit. This charge is not considered by management to be part of our ordinary operations. We believe this measure of EPS, adjusted for the impact of this cost, is more indicative of BD's underlying performance for fiscal year 2011, and allows investors to better assess our EPS performance for fiscal year 2012.
We also present our EPS growth for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 and for the full 2012 fiscal year (using adjusted EPS, as described in the two preceding paragraphs) after eliminating the effect of foreign currency translation. We believe that eliminating the effect of foreign currency translation allows investors to better understand the underlying operating results of BD and facilitates comparisons to prior periods.
We also present estimated EPS for fiscal year 2013 after eliminating the estimated impact of foreign currency translation and the estimated impact of the medical device excise tax that will go into effect during the fiscal year under the U.S. healthcare reform law. Eliminating the effect of foreign currency translation allows investors to better understand the anticipated underlying performance of BD and assess BD's earnings guidance relative to prior periods. Eliminating the impact of the medical device excise tax also allows investors to compare BD's 2013 guidance to prior periods as the tax will be in effect for the first time in 2013.
 
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.

BD ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR 2012 FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER AND FULL YEAR
 
 
 
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX), a leading global medical technology company, today reported quarterly revenues of $1.967 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2012, representing a decrease of 1.1 percent from the prior-year period, or an increase of 4.7 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Franklin Lakes, NJ (November 7, 2012)
For the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, BD reported revenues of $7.708 billion, representing an increase of 1.6 percent over the prior-year period or 4.3 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
"We are proud of our solid finish to 2012," said Vincent A. Forlenza, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President. "Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, we delivered on our financial and operating goals while continuing our ongoing investments in geographic expansion, new product platforms and strategic acquisitions. We believe we are well positioned to succeed and will continue to focus on our strategy of investing and innovating for growth. We are confident in our outlook for fiscal year 2013 and remain committed to delivering value to our customers and shareholders."
Sale of Discovery Labware Unit, Excluding Advanced Bioprocessing
In April 2012, the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell its BD Biosciences - Discovery Labware unit, excluding its Advanced Bioprocessing platform, to Corning Incorporated. The results of operations associated with this disposal group have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all quarters and years referred to in this release. The transaction was completed on October 31, 2012 and the Company will record a gain within discontinued operations in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013.
Fourth Quarter and Analysis of the Full Fiscal Year 2012 and 2011 Earnings
Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter were $1.35, representing an increase of 4.7 percent over the prior-year period. Current quarter results included a charge of $20 million, or $0.07 per share from continuing operations, resulting from primarily non-cash pension settlements. The prior-year period results included a non-cash charge of $9 million, or $0.03 per
share from continuing operations, resulting from the discontinuance of a research program within the Diagnostic Systems unit. Excluding these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 7.6 percent to $1.42, compared with $1.32 in the prior-year period. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter increased by 15.2 percent.
For the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $5.30, representing a decrease of 0.2 percent over the prior-year period. Excluding the aforementioned charges of $0.06 per share from continuing operations in fiscal year 2012, and $0.03 per share from continuing operations in fiscal year 2011, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 0.8 percent to $5.37, compared with $5.33 in the prior-year period. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fiscal year increased 4.7 percent. On a full year basis, the charge of $20 million, or $0.06 per share from continuing operations, differs from the charge in the fourth quarter of $0.07 per share from continuing operations due to the number of average shares outstanding between the fourth quarter and full year.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $1.049 billion, representing a decrease of 0.5 percent compared with the prior-year period, or an increase of 5.9 percent on a currency-neutral basis. The segment's revenue growth reflected strong sales across all three business units. For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2012, BD Medical revenues increased 2.1 percent, or 5.1 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $645 million, representing an increase of 0.5 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 5.1 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. The segment's growth was primarily driven by solid sales of Preanalytical Systems safety-engineered products and strong sales in the Diagnostic Systems unit, aided by the recent acquisition of KIESTRA. For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2012, BD Diagnostics revenues increased 2.3 percent, or 4.5 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $273 million, representing a decrease of 6.3 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 0.7 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Segment results continue to be negatively affected by weakness in the U.S. research market. For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2012, BD Biosciences revenues decreased by 1.5 percent. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, revenues increased by 0.7 percent.
Geographic Results
Fourth quarter revenues in the U.S. were $824 million, representing an increase of 1.2 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $1.143 billion, representing a decrease of 2.6 percent compared with the prior-year period, or an increase of 7.1 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. International revenues reflected continued strength in emerging markets and strong sales of safety-engineered products. For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2012, revenues in the U.S. were $3.288 billion, representing an increase of 1.2 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $4.421 billion, representing an increase of 1.9 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 6.6 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Fiscal 2013 Outlook for Full Year
The Company estimates that reported revenues for the full fiscal year 2013 will increase 2 to 3 percent, or about 3.5 to 4.5 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. The Company expects reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full fiscal year 2013 to be between $5.58 and $5.64. On a currency-neutral basis, the Company expects diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to grow 7 to 8 percent, or 10 to 11 percent excluding the impact of the medical device tax that goes into effect in January 2013 under the U.S. healthcare reform law. The Company also plans to repurchase, subject to market conditions, about $500 million of its common stock in 2013.

ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On February 5, 2013, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for its first fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2012. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP measures"), as follows:
 
 
We also present estimated EPS guidance for fiscal year 2013 after eliminating the estimated impact of foreign currency translation during the fiscal year and the estimated impact of the medical device excise tax that has gone into effect during the year under the U.S. healthcare reform law. Eliminating the effect of foreign currency translation allows investors to better understand the anticipated underlying performance of BD and assess BD's earnings guidance relative to prior periods. Eliminating the impact of the medical device excise tax also allows investors to compare BD's 2013 guidance to prior periods as the tax is in effect for the first time in 2013.
We also present estimated EPS growth rates for fiscal year 2013 after adjusting fiscal year 2012 EPS by excluding the pension settlement charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012. This charge is not considered by management to be part of ordinary operations, and management believes eliminating this charge when providing fiscal year 2013 EPS guidance allows investors to better understand our guidance in relation to fiscal year 2012.

BD ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR 2013 FIRST FISCAL QUARTER
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX), a leading global medical technology company, today reported quarterly revenues of $1.90 billion for the first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2012, representing an increase of 3.7 percent from the prior-year period, or 5.2 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Franklin Lakes, NJ (February 5, 2013)
"We are very pleased with our start to fiscal year 2013," said Vincent A. Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. "After two years of significant investments in our business, we are starting to see notable results. We are growing revenues across our three segments, driving margin expansion and delivering a higher quality of earnings. Our positive first quarter results give us the confidence to raise the bottom end of our guidance range on revenues and earnings per share."
Company Completes Acquisition of Safety Syringes, Inc.
On December 24, 2012, the Company completed its acquisition of Safety Syringes, Inc., or "SSI", a privately held California-based company that specializes in the development of anti-needlestick devices for prefilled syringes. SSI will be reported in the BD Medical  Pharmaceutical Systems unit.
First Quarter Earnings
Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter were $1.35, compared with $1.14 in the prior-year period, representing an 18.4 percent increase. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter increased by 15.8 percent. Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were aided in part by the benefit of an early flu season and favorable comparisons to the prior-year period.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $983 million, representing an increase of 3.5 percent compared with the prior-year period, or an increase of 5.1 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. The segment's revenue growth reflects strong sales in the Diabetes Care unit, which partially benefitted from a favorable comparison due to lower international sales in the prior-year period. Revenues also reflect strong international sales of safety-engineered products, as well as solid sales in the Medical Surgical Systems and Pharmaceutical Systems units.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $652 million, representing an increase of 5.0 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 6.1 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. The segment's growth was primarily driven by international expansion, a favorable comparison to the prior-year period in the Preanalytical Systems unit and an early flu season.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $265 million, representing an increase of 1.7 percent compared with the prior-year period, or an increase of 3.3 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Segment revenue growth was driven by solid instrument placements in the U.S., as well as a benefit from a favorable comparison versus the prior-year period. Prior-year results reflected reduced U.S. research funding and lower demand for high-end instruments.
Geographic Results
First quarter revenues in the U.S. of $830 million represent an increase of 3.0 percent over the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $1.07 billion, representing an increase of 4.3 percent compared with the prior-year period, or an increase of 7.0 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. International revenues reflected continued strength in emerging markets and strong sales of safety-engineered products.
Fiscal 2013 Outlook for Full Year
The Company is raising the bottom end of its previously communicated revenue growth guidance for the year of 3.5 to 4.5 percent to 4.0 to 4.5 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Reported revenue growth for the full fiscal year 2013 is expected to be between 3.5 and 4.0 percent. Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2013 is expected to be between $5.69 and $5.72, representing growth of 6.0 to 6.5 percent over adjusted 2012 diluted earnings per share of $5.37 after excluding the pension settlement charge in 2012. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to grow 7.5 to 8.0 percent over 2012 adjusted diluted earnings per share, or 10.5 to 11.0 percent, excluding the estimated impact of the medical device tax that went into effect last month under the U.S. healthcare reform law. In line with its previously disclosed guidance, the Company plans to repurchase, subject to market conditions, $500 million of its common stock in fiscal year 2013.

A conference call regarding BD's first quarter results and its expectations for the full fiscal year 2013 will be broadcast live on BD's website, , along with related slides, at 8:00 a.m. (ET) Tuesday, February 5, 2013.

All such statements are based upon current expectations of BD and involve a number of business risks and uncertainties.

With respect to forward-looking statements contained herein, a number of factors could cause actual results to vary materially from any forward-looking statement. These factors include, but are not limited to: potential cuts in healthcare spending by the U.S. government as part of deficit reduction measures, including "sequestration", which could result in reduced demand for our product or downward pricing pressure; the unknown consequences of healthcare reform in the United States, including the impact of the reduction in Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and other customers, which could reduce demand for our products and increase downward pricing pressure; adverse changes in regional, national or foreign economic conditions, including any impact that may result from the current global economic conditions on our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations, the demand for our products and services as a result of reduced government funding, lower utilization rates or otherwise, or our suppliers' ability to provide products needed for our operations; changes in interest or foreign currency exchange rates; our ability to successfully integrate any businesses we acquire; competitive factors; pricing and market share pressures; difficulties inherent in product development and delays in product introductions; increases in energy costs and their effect on, among other things, the cost of producing BD's products; fluctuations in costs and availability of raw materials and in BD's ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships; new or changing laws impacting our business or changes in enforcement practices with respect to such laws; uncertainties of litigation (as described in BD's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission); future healthcare reform, including changes in government pricing and reimbursement policies or other cost containment reforms; the effects of potential pandemic diseases; and issuance of new or revised accounting standards, as well as other factors discussed in BD's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

On May 2, 2013, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for its second fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2013. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP measures"), as follows:
 
 
We also present estimated EPS guidance for fiscal year 2013 after adjusting fiscal year 2012 EPS to exclude the pension settlement charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 and by eliminating the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the medical device excise tax. The pension settlement charge is not considered by management to be part of ordinary operations, and management believes eliminating this charge when providing fiscal year 2013 EPS guidance allows investors to better understand our guidance in relation to fiscal year 2012. Eliminating the effects of foreign currency translation and the excise tax allows investors to better understand the anticipated underlying performance of BD and assess BD's earnings guidance relative to prior periods.
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods and to the performance of peer companies. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.

 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX), a leading global medical technology company, today reported quarterly revenues of $2.0 billion for the second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2013, representing an increase of 3.7 percent from the prior-year period, or 4.1 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Franklin Lakes, NJ (May 2, 2013)
"We continued to deliver solid performance in the second quarter. Our results for the first half of the year give us the confidence to raise guidance for fiscal year 2013," said Vincent A. Forlenza, Chairman, CEO and President. "Additionally, our recent announcements of the BD Simplist
TM
product line and the Cato Software acquisition demonstrate how we are continuing to invest in innovation both organically and through strategic acquisition opportunities. We believe we are well positioned for continued success in fiscal year 2013 and beyond."
Company Completes Acquisition of Cato Software Solutions
As previously announced on March 12, 2013, the Company completed its acquisition of Cato Software Solutions, or "CSS." CSS, based in Vienna, Austria, provides a suite of comprehensive medication safety software solutions that are intended to prevent medication errors and improve efficiency in both pharmacy and drug delivery settings. CSS revenues will be reported in the BD Medical  Medical Surgical Systems unit.
Company Enters Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Market
On March 27, 2013, the Company announced its entrance into the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry with BD Simplist
TM
, a line of ready-to-administer, prefilled generic injectables. BD Simplist prefilled injectables will be commercialized and manufactured by BD Rx Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of BD, which plans to launch 20 to 30 drugs over the next few years. BD Rx Inc. revenues will be reported in the BD Medical  Medical Surgical Systems unit.
Second Quarter and Six-Month Fiscal 2013 Operating Results
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter were $1.39, compared with $1.31 in the prior-year period, representing a 6.1 percent increase, or 7.6 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Excluding the medical device tax that went into effect in January 2013 under the U.S. healthcare reform law, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.44, which represents growth of 9.9 percent. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter increased 11.5 percent.
For the six-month period ending March 31, 2013, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.74, compared with $2.45 in the prior-year period. This represents growth of 11.8 percent. Excluding the medical device tax, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.79. This represents growth of 13.9 percent excluding the medical device tax. Foreign currency had an immaterial impact on earnings per share for the six-month period.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $1.062 billion, representing an increase of 4.0 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 4.2 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. The segment's revenue growth reflects solid sales in the Medical Surgical Systems and Diabetes Care units. As expected, we experienced lower revenue growth in the Pharmaceutical Systems unit, reflecting an unfavorable comparison to the prior-year period.
For the six-month period ended March 31, 2013, BD Medical revenues increased 3.7 percent, or 4.7 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $659 million, representing an increase of 4.6 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 4.9 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. The segment's growth was driven by new product sales as well as international expansion in the Diagnostic Systems unit.
For the six-month period ended March 31, 2013, BD Diagnostics revenues increased 4.8 percent, or 5.5 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $279 million, representing an increase of 0.6 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 1.9 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Segment revenue growth was driven by solid instrument placements in the U.S., as well as a favorable timing of orders in Advanced Bioprocessing. This was offset in part by softness in Western Europe due to austerity measures and timing of government funding in Japan.
For the six-month period ended March 31, 2013, BD Biosciences revenues increased 1.1 percent, or 2.6 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
Geographic Results
Second quarter revenues in the U.S. of $824 million represent an increase of 0.3 percent over the prior-year period. As expected, U.S. revenues were impacted by timing of orders. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $1.177 billion, representing an increase of 6.2 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 6.9 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. International revenues reflected continued strength in emerging markets and strong sales of safety-engineered products.
For the six-month period ended March 31, 2013, revenues in the U.S. were $1.654 billion, representing an increase of 1.6 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $2.247 billion, representing an increase of 5.3 percent when compared with the prior-year period, or 7.0 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Fiscal 2013 Outlook for Full Year
The Company is raising its previously communicated guidance for the full fiscal year 2013 on revenues and earnings per share growth. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue growth is expected to be between 4.5 and 5.0 percent, or an increase of 50 basis points. Reported revenue growth guidance remains consistent with the Company's previously guided range of 3.5 to 4.0 percent. Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2013 are expected to be between $5.72 and $5.75, or an increase of $0.03 from the previous guidance range. This represents growth of 6.5 to 7.0 percent over 2012 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.37, which excludes the pension settlement charge in fiscal year 2012. On a currency-neutral basis, earnings per share are expected to increase 100 basis points to 8.5 to 9.0 percent. After adjusting for the impact of the medical device tax and foreign currency, adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to grow 11.0 to 11.5 percent. In line with previously disclosed guidance, the Company plans to repurchase, subject to market conditions, about $500 million of its common stock in fiscal year 2013.

These factors include, but are not limited to: potential cuts in healthcare spending by the U.S. government as part of deficit reduction measures, including "sequestration", which could result in reduced demand for our product or downward pricing pressure; the unknown consequences of healthcare reform in the United States, including the impact of the reduction in Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and other customers, which could reduce demand for our products and increase downward pricing pressure; adverse changes in regional, national or foreign economic conditions, including any impact that may result from the current global economic conditions on our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations, the demand for our products and services as a result of reduced government funding, lower utilization rates or otherwise, or our suppliers' ability to provide products needed for our operations; changes in interest or foreign currency exchange rates; our ability to successfully integrate any businesses we acquire; competitive factors;
pricing and market share pressures; difficulties inherent in product development and delays in product introductions; increases in energy costs and their effect on, among other things, the cost of producing BD's products; fluctuations in costs and availability of raw materials and in BD's ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships; new or changing laws impacting our business or changes in enforcement practices with respect to such laws; uncertainties of litigation (as described in BD's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission); future healthcare reform, including changes in government pricing and reimbursement policies or other cost containment reforms; the effects of potential pandemic diseases; and issuance of new or revised accounting standards, as well as other factors discussed in BD's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not intend to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof except as required by applicable laws or regulations.
