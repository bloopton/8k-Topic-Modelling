EXHIBIT 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
Santa Clara, Calif., January 30, 2003
 Roche and Affymetrix, Inc. (NASDAQ: AFFX) today announced an agreement in which Affymetrix grants Roche access to its patented GeneChip brand technologies to develop and commercialize diagnostic products in a broad range of human disease areas. With these technologies, Roche Diagnostics will develop and market tests for a wide range of diseases such as cancer, osteoporosis, cardiovascular, metabolic, infectious, and inflammatory diseases.
 
The agreement gives Roche non-exclusive rights to Affymetrix' array and instrument technologies for up to 18 years.  It will enable Roche to create and market GeneChip laboratory tests for DNA analysis, genotyping, and resequencing applications, as well as for RNA expression analysis.
 
"Affymetrix' technology is highly complementary to our polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology", stated Heino von Prondzynski, Head of Roche Diagnostics and a member of Roche's Corporate Executive Committee. "We believe that creating targeted microarray expression profiles for cancer, and genotyping and resequencing profiles for other diseases will enable us to develop and commercialize novel standardized diagnostic solutions, taking this exciting technology out of the research lab and into the clinical setting. This will allow physicians to tailor therapy for individual patients."
 
"Roche and Affymetrix have become partners in creating genetic tests to aid clinicians in the diagnosis and treatment of human disease," added Stephen P.A. Fodor, Ph.D., the CEO of Affymetrix. "We believe the synergies between our GeneChip platform and Roche's PCR technology will establish new standards for genetic clinical testing. We are thrilled to be at the forefront of this new marketplace with Roche."  Fodor noted that he expects these tests to become as common in patient care as the X-ray, the EKG, and other routine examinations.
 
Together with Affymetrix, Roche will undertake research projects to develop and validate specific tests, along with clinical trials for those tests. The two companies will also collaborate on high-throughput packaging and instrument technologies for genetic tests for bringing state-of-the-art array scanning to diagnostic laboratories.
 
Microarrays enable researchers to qualitatively and quantitatively measure gene expression levels in a broad range of biologically relevant organisms.  They are also used for DNA analysis applications including mapping, genotyping, and resequencing.  DNA microarrays were the first high-throughput tool for studying gene function.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, Affymetrix will receive a one-time, upfront payment of 70 million US dollars.  Affymetrix may also receive other compensation, including royalties on sales of diagnostic kits and milestone payments for technical and commercial achievements.

Affymetrix Updates First Quarter
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., April 3 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/  Affymetrix, Inc. (Nasdaq: AFFX), today reported that based on preliminary financial data, the company expects product and related revenue as well as net income for the first quarter of 2003 to be lower than previous guidance.
 
"After posting record revenues for fiscal year 2002, our rate of growth has been affected by global economic weakness and cautious capital spending," said Greg Schiffman, Affymetrix' senior vice president and chief financial officer. "While academic array revenue growth remained strong, capital spending in the academic and biotech sectors has slowed."
 
Affymetrix now expects product and related revenue for the first quarter of 2003 to be in the range of $60-62 million, compared to previous guidance of $71-73 million. The company will release first quarter operating results after the close of the market on April 23, 2003. Company management will conduct its quarterly conference call and provide financial guidance at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time on that date.

The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Affymetrix, Inc. ("Affymetrix") approved, and the full Board acknowledged such approval of, the Affymetrix, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, effective as of December 9, 2004 (the "Plan").

Distributions occur upon termination of service (or the 6-month anniversary of termination), death or upon such other dates that may be elected by the participant in accordance with the terms of the Plan. Generally participants may elect for distributions of deferred amounts upon termination or death to be paid in the form of either a lump sum or in annual installments. Distributions would be made in the event of a change of control of Affymetrix. Deferrals are adjusted for gain or loss based on the performance of one or more investment options selected by the participant from among investment funds chosen by the Compensation Committee of the Board. Affymetrix in its sole discretion may suspend or terminate the Plan or revise or amend it in any respect, except that no such action may reduce vested amounts credited to deferral accounts, and such accounts will continue to be owed to the participants or beneficiaries and will continue to be a liability of Affymetrix until paid.

In accordance with, and subject to, the rules and procedures that are established from time to time by the Committee, in its sole discretion, amounts shall be credited or debited to a Participant's Account Balance in accordance with the following rules:
     
(a)
Measurement Funds
. The Committee shall select from time to time certain mutual funds, insurance company separate accounts, indexed rates or other methods (the "Measurement Funds") for purposes of crediting or debiting additional amounts to Participants' Account Balances. As necessary, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, discontinue, substitute or add a Measurement Fund; provided however, that any decision to retain, discontinue or substitute a Measurement Fund shall be made in good faith.
     
(b)
Election of Measurement Funds
. A Participant, in connection with his or her initial deferral election in accordance with Section 3.3(a) above, shall elect, on the Election Form, one or more Measurement Fund(s) (as described in Section 3.8(a) above) to be used to determine the amounts to be credited or debited to his or her Account Balance. If a Participant does not elect any of the Measurement Funds as described in the previous sentence, the Participant's Account Balance shall automatically be allocated into a default Measurement Fund which is selected by
the Committee and identified prior to such allocation in Plan communication materials. A Participant (or if the Participant is deceased, each of the Participant's Beneficiaries entitled to a Survivor Benefit under Article 8) may (but is not required to) elect, by submitting an Election Form to the Committee that is accepted by the Committee or by any other procedure approved by the Committee, to add or delete one or more Measurement Fund(s) to be used to determine the amounts to be credited or debited to his or her Account Balance, or to change the portion of his or her Account Balance allocated to each previously or newly elected Measurement Fund. If an election is made in accordance with the previous sentence, it shall apply as of the first business day deemed reasonably practicable by the Committee, in its sole discretion, and shall continue thereafter for each subsequent day in which the Participant participates in the Plan, unless changed in accordance with the previous sentence.
     
(c)
Proportionate Allocation
. In making any election described in Section 3.8(b) above, the Participant (or Beneficiary) shall specify on the Election Form, in increments of one percent (1%), the percentage of his or her Account Balance or Measurement Fund, as applicable, to be allocated/reallocated to a Measurement Fund. A Participant's (or Beneficiary's)
Measurement Fund elections must total one hundred percent (100%). The Committee may require that a percentage election with respect to any particular Measurement Fund be no less than ten percent (10%). Unless otherwise expressly provided by the Committee, a Measurement Fund election(s) shall apply on a pro rata basis to each of the Participant's accounts under this Plan and a Participant (or Beneficiary) may not make separate Measurement Fund elections for the Participant's Deferral Account and/or Company Contribution Account.
     
(d)
Crediting or Debiting Method
. The performance of each selected Measurement Fund (either positive or negative) will be determined by the Committee based on the performance of the Measurement Funds themselves. A Participant's Account Balance shall be credited or debited not less frequently than on a monthly basis based on the performance of each selected Measurement Fund for the corresponding period of time.
     
(e)
No Actual Investment
. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan that may be interpreted to the contrary, the Measurement Funds are to be used for measurement purposes only, and a Participant's election of any such Measurement Fund, the allocation of his or her Account Balance thereto, the calculation of additional amounts and the crediting or debiting of such amounts to a Participant's Account Balance shall not be considered or construed in any manner as an actual investment of his or her Account Balance in any such Measurement Fund. In the event that the Company or the Trustee (as that term is defined in the Trust), in its own discretion, decides to invest funds in any or all of the investments on which the Measurement Funds are based, no Participant shall have any rights in or to such investments themselves. Without limiting the foregoing, a Participant's Account Balance shall at all times be a bookkeeping entry only and shall not represent any investment made on his or her behalf by the Company or the Trust; the Participant shall at all times remain an unsecured creditor of the Company.

If necessary, the Committee may reduce the Annual Deferral Amount in order to comply with this Section 3.09.
     
(b)
Company Contribution Account
. When a Participant becomes vested in a portion of his or her Company Contribution Account, the Participant's Employer(s) shall withhold from that portion of the Participant's Base Salary, Bonus, and/or Commissions that is not deferred, in a manner determined by the Employer(s), the Participant's share of FICA and other employment taxes on such Company Contribution Amount.

The potential payout of bonus compensation is based on a percentage of the executive officer's target bonus and is dependent on the achievement of corporate financial and strategic goals and individual performance.

(c)
If any portion of the Final Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses its right to appraisal, such shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive the Final Merger Consideration issuable and/or payable in respect of such shares of Company Stock less the Escrow Holdback applicable thereto. The Company shall give Parent
prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

It is the intention of the parties hereto that the Company Employee Stock Options and Supplemental Options assumed by Parent following the Effective Time pursuant to this Section will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, qualify as incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Code, to the extent any such Company Employee Stock Options or Supplemental Options qualified as incentive stock options immediately prior to the Effective Time.
     
(b)
As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to each holder of an outstanding Company Employee Stock Option or Supplemental Option an appropriate notice setting forth such holder's rights pursuant thereto.

(c)

. No fractional shares of Parent Stock shall be issued in the Merger. All fractional shares of Parent Stock that a holder of shares of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated and if a fractional share results from such aggregation, such holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash without interest determined by multiplying the Average Pre-Closing Parent Stock Price by the fraction of a share of Parent Stock to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled.
     
Section 2.11.
Withholding Rights
. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Stock in respect of which the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.
     
Section 2.12.
Escrow.
At the Effective Time, Parent shall withhold from the Final Merger Consideration otherwise issuable and/or payable in connection with the Merger an aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock and/or an aggregate amount of cash equal to the Escrow Amount, in the same relative proportions as the proportions of Parent Common Stock and cash that comprise the Final Merger Consideration. Prior to or simultaneously with the Effective Time, the Shareholders' Representative and Parent shall enter into an escrow agreement (the "
Escrow Agreement
") with an escrow agent selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Shareholders' Representative (the "
Escrow Agent
") in the form of Exhibit C hereto. Pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, at the Effective Time Parent shall deposit the Escrow Amount into an escrow account, which account is to be managed by the Escrow Agent (the "
Escrow Account
"). Distributions of any shares of Parent Common Stock and/or cash from the Escrow Account shall be governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (the shares of Parent Common Stock and cash, if any, in the Escrow Account being referred to as the "
Escrow Fund
"). The Escrow Amount shall be withheld from, and allocated to, each holder of Company Stock based on such holder's Escrow Holdback. All distributions from the Escrow Fund shall be made in shares of Parent Common Stock and/or cash in the same relative proportions as originally included in the Escrow Amount.
     
Section 2.13.
Resolution of Disputed Amount
. (a) In the event that any Disputed Amount is included in the Escrow Amount, Parent and the Shareholders' Representative shall, during the 15 days following the Closing Date, use commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts. If Parent and the Shareholders' Representative are unable to reach agreement during such period, they shall promptly thereafter cause independent accountants of nationally recognized standing reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Shareholders' Representative (who shall not have any material relationship with Parent, the Company, the Shareholders' Representative or any of their respective Affiliates) (the "
Independent Accountants
"), promptly to review the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating Closing Working Capital (the "
Independent Accountants' Working Capital
"). In calculating Independent
Accountant' Working Capital, such Independent Accountants shall consider only those items or amounts in the calculation of Closing Working Capital as to which Parent has disagreed pursuant to and in accordance with Section 2.02(b) . Such Independent Accountants shall deliver to Parent and the Shareholders' Representative, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 30 days following receipt of all information requested from the Company to calculate Closing Working Capital), a report that explains any discrepancies between such Independent Accountants' Working Capital and Final Working Capital and sets forth the Independent Accountants' calculation of Independent Accountants' Working Capital. Such report and the calculations set forth therein shall be final and binding upon Parent, the Shareholders' Representative and their respective Affiliates and shall not be subject to challenge by any of the foregoing in a court of law or otherwise. The cost of such review and report shall be paid from the Escrow Fund if Independent Accountants' Working Capital is closer to Parent's calculation of Closing Working Capital than the Company's estimate of Closing Working Capital.
     
(b)
As promptly as practicable following the delivery of the Independent Accountants' report specified above, each of Parent and the Shareholders' Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent to make distributions from the Escrow Fund, and the Escrow Agent shall make such distributions, as follows:
     
(i)
If Independent Accountants' Working Capital is less than Final Working Capital, then the Escrow Agent shall distribute from the Escrow Fund (A) to Parent, an amount equal to (1) the amount of the difference between the Adjusted Merger Consideration as actually determined pursuant to Section 2.02(e) above and the Adjusted Merger Consideration that would have resulted had such amount been calculated using Independent Accountants' Working Capital in lieu of Final Working Capital plus (2) the cost of the Independent Accountants' review and report pursuant to Section 2.13(a) and (B) to the former shareholders of the Company (in proportion to each such shareholder's Escrow Holdback), the balance, if any, of the Disputed Amount that remains in the Escrow Fund following the distributions specified in clause (A) of this Section 2.13(b)(i); and
     
(ii)
(A) If Independent Accountants' Working Capital is greater than or equal to Final Working Capital, then the Escrow Agent shall distribute the Disputed Amount from the Escrow Fund to the former shareholders of the
Company (in proportion to each such shareholder's Escrow Holdback) and (B) in the event that Independent Accountants' Working Capital is greater than Final Working Capital, Parent shall issue and/or pay to the former shareholders of the Company (in proportion to each such shareholder's Escrow Holdback), the number of shares of Parent Common Stock and/or cash not already included in the Disputed Amount that would have been issued and/or paid to such former shareholders if the Independent Accountants' Working Capital had been the Final Working Capital at the Closing;
provided
, however, that in no event shall the amounts distributed to the former shareholders of the Company pursuant to this Section 2.13(b)(ii), when aggregated with the Final Merger Consideration, exceed the Unadjusted Merger Consideration.
For purposes of calculating the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be included in a distribution of a given amount pursuant to this Section 2.13(b), Parent Common Stock shall be ascribed the same value given to it in connection with the calculation of Final Merger Consideration.
     
Section 2.14.
Lost Certificates
. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the entry by such Person into an indemnification agreement in form satisfactory to Parent, or the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Final Merger Consideration issuable and/or payable in respect of the shares of Company Stock evidenced by such Certificate (less the Escrow Holdback applicable thereto), as contemplated by this Article 2.
     
Section 3.01.

Quarterly Highlights
 
Affymetrix entered into a definitive agreement to acquire ParAllele BioScience Inc., a privately-held South San Francisco-based company that provides assay technology for comprehensive genetic studies. In June 2005, the two companies launched MegAllele assays for targeted single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping applications under a previous development and commercialization agreement.
 - 
                 
 
Affymetrix significantly expanded its GeneChip Mapping 500K SNP genotyping Early Access program for genome-wide association studies.
 - 
                 
 
In a project hinting at the scale of future genetic studies, the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard will genotype 12,000 samples with the GeneChip Mapping 500K. This project is expected to generate approximately six billion genotypes, several times the magnitude of the International HapMap Project.
 - 
                 
 
In powerful examples of the scalability of Affymetrix' genotyping technology, Perlegen Sciences initiated the following large-scale studies:
 - 
                 
A collaboration with RIKEN to conduct high-resolution, whole-genome studies of up to 47 common diseases. This personalized medicine project, led by Professor Nakamura, will complete billions of genotypes, bringing together biobank samples, industry-leading SNP genotyping technology from Affymetrix, and international expertise in the analysis of genetic variation.
 - 
                 
A study to better understand the genetics of bipolar disorder in collaboration with the Pritzker Neuropsychiatric Disorders Research Consortium.
 - 
                 
A study to analyze the genetics of common diseases in post-menopausal women, funded by the Women's Health Initiative.
 - 
                 
 
Affymetrix launched the next-generation GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G upgrade package to support high-resolution GeneChip products, including whole-genome tiling arrays, All-Exon products for studying splice variants of known genes, and whole-genome genotyping products.
 - 
                 
 
Affymetrix began development of a next-generation GeneChip scanner through a non-exclusive relationship with CapitalBio Corporation, a leading life science company based in Beijing, P.R. China.
 - 
                 
 
To address the growing demand for GeneChip technology, CapitalBio joined Shanghai Biochip Co., Ltd. as a new service provider for Affymetrix technologies in the Chinese market.
 - 
                 
 
To standardize the protocols in the growing market of whole blood processing, Affymetrix launched the GeneChip Blood RNA Concentration Kit and Globin-Reduction RNA Controls.
 - 
                 
 
Financial Outlook
 
For fiscal year 2005, the Company is reiterating revenue guidance for product and product related revenue of roughly $390 million and total revenue of $405 million, which includes Perlegen, royalties and other revenue.
 
As a result of the pending acquisition of ParAllele, expected to close in the third quarter, the Company expects to incur fiscal 2005 merger-related charges for in-process research and development of approximately $15 million or $0.21 per share, as well as operational charges of approximately $7 million or $0.10 per share. These operational charges exclude non-cash amortization currently estimated to be around $4 million or $0.05 per share, which is subject to change based upon fluctuations in the Company's stock price. As a result of these anticipated merger and operational related charges, the Company expects net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2005 to be around $0.77.
 
For the third quarter of 2005, the Company expects product and product related revenue of approximately $92 million, total revenue of around $95 million, and net loss per basic share of approximately $0.06, which includes a merger-related charge for in-process research and development of approximately $15 million or $0.23 per share, as well as operational charges of approximately $2.5 million or $0.04 per share. These operational charges exclude non-cash amortization of about $1 million or $0.02 per share.

  Affymetrix, Inc., (Nasdaq: AFFX) today announced that due to low initial-production yields of its most advanced commercial product, the 500K Mapping Array Set, shipment volumes have been constrained. Based on preliminary financial data, the Company expects that for the third quarter ending September 30, 2005, its product and product related revenue will be $10 -12 million below previous guidance.
Santa Clara, Calif.
Sept. 27, 2005
"During the third quarter, we experienced unusually low manufacturing yields on our new 500K Mapping Array Set." stated Stephen P.A. Fodor, Ph.D. Founder, Chairman and CEO of Affymetrix. "While we have recently seen improving yields, these improvements occurred late in the quarter and we now project that we will be unable to manufacture enough product to meet our revenue target."

Financial Outlook
The Company continues to experience low production yields on certain array products and expects that this will continue in the fourth quarter. As a result, the Company anticipates that product and product related revenue for the fourth quarter will be at least $10 million below previous guidance. Therefore, for the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company now expects product and product related revenue of $120 million and total revenue of about $123 million.
 
In connection with the completion of its pending acquisition of ParAllele, the Company expects to incur fourth quarter merger-related charges for in-process research and development of approximately $15 million or $0.19 per share, and ParAllele operating expenses of approximately $3 million or $0.04 per share. These operational charges exclude non-cash amortization currently estimated to be around $1.5 million or $0.01 per share. These merger-related charges are subject to change pending the completion of the merger. As a result of these anticipated merger and operational related charges, the Company expects fourth quarter net income per diluted share of approximately $0.19, which includes the merger-related charges of $0.24, net of taxes.
 
For fiscal year 2005, the Company now expects product and product related revenue of around $365 million, total revenue of about $380 million and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2005 of $0.66, including the $0.24 in ParAllele charges referred to above.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
 
In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP, the Financial Outlook statements in the Company's earnings release contain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effects of non-cash equity-based stock compensation expense as a result of the Company's adoption of FAS 123R.  Beginning with its first quarter 2006 earnings release, the Company's earnings releases will include non-GAAP financial measures of its financial results for the reporting period that exclude the income statement effects of non-cash equity-based stock compensation expense used in calculating non-GAAP earnings per diluted share.  The Company believes that the presentation of results excluding non-cash equity-based stock compensation expense will provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company's core operating results. The Company is using the Modified Prospective Method in its adoption of FAS 123R and as such, is not required to restate prior year results for the impact of option expensing.  Therefore, the Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparison of operating results across reporting periods.  The Company will use these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes.  The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Other Events.
 
Gregory Schiffman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will be speaking at the Citigroup 2006 Healthcare Conference in Washington, DC on February 28, 2006. Mr. Schiffman's remarks are expected to include the following matters:
 
We are establishing a probe array manufacturing facility in Singapore. This new facility will increase our manufacturing capacity, establish redundancy for array manufacturing and provide a source of array product for our international businesses. In February 2006, we successfully completed the first in a series of manufacturing tests to demonstrate the capability of the Singapore facility. Passing this milestone keeps us on track for Singapore commercial array production in the second half of 2006.
 
Recent production yields on the Mapping 500K Array Set consistently exceed 75% in our Sacramento facility. At current yields, we believe that we will have sufficient capacity to meet customer demand for the Mapping 500K Array Set in 2006.
 
More than 70 of our existing customers are currently scaling up production on the Mapping 500K Array Set and some of these customers are experiencing challenges in the scale up. Since many customers complete projects before reordering, this may affect the timing of the 500K product reorders. In addition, we believe that the market for whole genome mapping products has temporarily slowed as early technology adopters begin to report on their whole genome genotyping studies and customers evaluate claims of competitive products about future price and performance.
 
The factors described above may increase the risk around our expected revenue targets for the Mapping 500K Array Set.
 
All statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K that are not historical are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act as amended, including statements regarding Affymetrix' "expectations," "beliefs," "hopes," "intentions," "strategies" or the like. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially for Affymetrix from those projected, including, but not limited to: risks of the Company's ability to achieve and sustain higher levels of revenue (including risks associated with the Company's ability to achieve hoped for revenue targets for the Mapping 500K Array Set), higher gross margins, reduced operating expenses; uncertainties relating to technological approaches, manufacturing (including risks related to the Company's ability to achieve hoped-for manufacturing yields for certain array products, including the ability to identify and resolve manufacturing problems and risks and uncertainties associated with establishing our new probe array manufacturing facility in Singapore), product development; personnel retention; uncertainties related to cost and pricing of Affymetrix products; dependence on collaborative partners; uncertainties relating to sole source suppliers; uncertainties relating to FDA and other regulatory approvals; competition; risks relating to intellectual property of others and the uncertainties of patent protection and litigation.

Quarterly Highlights
 
RNA analysis
 
 - 
                 
Affymetrix extended its GeneChip Exon Array product line with the launch of the Mouse and Rat Exon 1.0 ST Arrays. Syntenic design across the three species provides researchers with an easier way to
perform comparative genomics between model systems and humans. Exon arrays enable a deeper understanding of alternative splicing on a whole-genome scale on a single array.
 - 
                 
Affymetrix expanded its gene expression portfolio by launching nine Tiling Array products for five different organisms including Human, Mouse, Arabidopsis, S. cerevisiae, and S. pombe. These products enable genome-wide monitoring and discovery of RNA expression patterns, mapping sites of DNA-protein interactions and investigation of epigenomic changes like methylation or acetylation.
 - 
                 
The Company partnered with Iconix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to develop a database for pharmaceutical customers investigating the toxicological and pharmacological properties of drugs and drug candidates. Together, Affymetrix' GeneChip expression arrays and Iconix' analysis methods will provide detailed toxicology information that will help scientists to better prioritize candidates and make preclinical development decisions faster than ever before.
 
DNA analysis
 
 - 
                 
Affymetrix announced that Korea's National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Center for Disease Control and Prevention will use the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Array Set for a series of groundbreaking genome-wide association studies in critical disease areas, including diabetes, hypertension, asthma and metabolic syndrome. This study will generate more than 10 billion individual genotypes from 20,000 human DNA samples to help identify the genetic causes of these diseases.
 - 
                 
Using the Affymetrix GeneChip Mapping 100K Array, researchers led by the Boston University School of Medicine identified a common genetic variant associated with a higher risk of obesity. Published in the April 14, 2006 issue of Science, the discovery of this predisposing genetic signature may enable better design of therapies to treat obesity.
 
Licensing
 
 - 
                 
Abbott Molecular, a division of Abbott, obtained a royalty-bearing, non-exclusive, worldwide license to a number of Affymetrix patents that will allow it to manufacture and sell comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) microarrays, related readers and software in the research and diagnostics field.
 
Governance
 
 - 
                 
Elected Robert H. Trice, Ph.D., senior vice president for business development at Lockheed Martin Corporation, to the Affymetrix Board of Directors. Since joining Lockheed Martin in 1996, he has held several senior management positions and has overseen many international aspects of the business.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP, the Company's earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effects of non-cash equity-based stock compensation expense as a result of the Company's adoption of FAS 123R on January 1, 2006. The Company believes that the presentation of results excluding non-cash equity-based stock compensation expense provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company's core operating results. The Company is using the Modified Prospective Method in its adoption of FAS 123R and as such, will not restate prior year results for the impact of employee stock option expensing. Therefore, the Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparison of operating results across reporting periods. A reconciliation between the Company's results of operations on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the periods reported is included as part of the condensed consolidated statements of operations at the end of the Company's earnings release.
 
The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.
 
All statements in this press release that are not historical are "forward-looking statements" under the federal securities laws. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including but not limited to: risks related to the Company's ability to achieve and sustain higher levels of revenue and improved gross margins and operating income; uncertainties relating to technological approaches, manufacturing (including risks related to achieving hoped-for manufacturing yields and resolving manufacturing problems) and product development; uncertainties relating to changes in senior management personnel and structure; uncertainties related to cost and pricing of Affymetrix products; risks relating to dependence on collaborative partners; uncertainties relating to sole source suppliers; uncertainties relating to FDA and other regulatory approvals; competition; risks relating to intellectual property of others and the uncertainties of patent protection and litigation. These and other risk factors are discussed in Affymetrix' Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 and other SEC reports, including its Form 10-Q reports for subsequent periods. Affymetrix expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in Affymetrix' expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statements are based.

Recent Highlights
RNA analysis
                 
Using the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 array, a team of researchers led by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) discovered the first gene expression signature to distinguish Burkitt's lymphomas from large B cell lymphomas.  Published in the June 8, 2006 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, the discovery of this Burkitt's lymphoma signature may enable the design of more highly specific chemotherapy treatments.
DNA analysis
Affymetrix announced that it will introduce a 1 million-SNP product in the first quarter of 2007.  Additionally, the 500K set will be offered as a single array by the end of the year, increasing throughput and enabling scientists to devote more resources toward performing larger experiments.
                 
Molecular Diagnostics
                 
The Company has partnered with Epigenomics AG (Frankfurt, Prime Standard: ECX), a molecular diagnostics company developing tests based on DNA methylation.  Epigenomics has been granted non-exclusive access to Affymetrix microarray technology to develop and market microarray-based in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests for oncology and other indications.
Affymetrix currently has 18 cancer signatures under development with our Powered by Affymetrix partners.
                 
Licensing
                 
Invitrogen Corporation obtained a non-exclusive, worldwide license to a number of Affymetrix patents that will allow it to manufacture and sell spotted nucleic acid microarrays in the research field.
The Company has been engaged in an internal review, performed under the direction of the audit committee of the board of directors, of its historical stock option grant practices from January 1, 1997 through May 31, 2006.  This internal review has revealed certain documentation lapses in the period 1997 to 1999, including one instance where the Company has determined that the option grant date should have been recorded differently.  The review does not indicate that there was any pattern or practice of inappropriately identifying grant dates with hindsight in order to provide "discounted" or "in-the-money" grants.  Based on the Company's review to date and given the dates of the grants in question, the Company does not anticipate any material adjustment to the financial results of operations included in this press release.
 
Affymetrix' management team will host a conference call on July 31, 2006 at 2:00 p.m. PT to review its operating results for the second quarter of 2006. A live webcast can be accessed by visiting the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at www.affymetrix.com.

About Affymetrix
Affymetrix scientists invented the world's first high-density microarray in 1989 and began selling the first commercial microarray in 1994. Since then, Affymetrix GeneChip technology has become the industry standard in molecular biology research. Affymetrix technology is used by the world's top pharmaceutical, diagnostic and biotechnology companies as well as leading academic, government and not-for-profit research institutes. More than 1,400 systems have been installed around the world and nearly 4,000 peer-reviewed papers have been published using the technology. Affymetrix' patented photolithographic manufacturing process provides the most information capacity available today on an array, enabling researchers to use a whole-genome approach to analyzing the relationship between genetics and health.

The Company maintains important sales and marketing operations in Europe and Asia and has about 1,100 employees worldwide. For more information about Affymetrix, please visit the Company's website at www.affymetrix.com.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP, the Company's earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effects of non-cash equity-based stock compensation expense as a result of the Company's adoption of FAS 123R on January 1, 2006.  The Company believes that the presentation of results excluding non-cash equity-based stock compensation expense provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company's core operating results. The Company used the Modified Prospective Method to adopt FAS 123R and as such, did not restate prior year results for the impact of employee stock option expensing.  Therefore, the Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparison of operating results across reporting periods.  A reconciliation between the Company's results of operations on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the periods reported is included as part of the condensed consolidated statements of operations at the end of the Company's earnings release.
The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes.  The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. The
 
non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.
All statements in this press release that are not historical are "forward-looking statements" under the federal securities laws. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including but not limited to: risks related to the Company's ability to achieve and sustain higher levels of revenue and improved gross margins and operating income and reduced operating expenses; uncertainties relating to technological approaches, manufacturing (including risks related to achieving hoped-for manufacturing yields and resolving manufacturing problems) and product development; uncertainties relating to changes in senior management personnel and structure; uncertainties related to cost and pricing of Affymetrix products; risks relating to dependence on collaborative partners; uncertainties relating to sole source suppliers; uncertainties relating to FDA and other regulatory approvals; competition; risks relating to intellectual property of others and the uncertainties of patent protection and litigation; and risks and uncertainties associated with the outcome of the Company's internal review of its historical stock option grant practices discussed in this press release. These and other risk factors are discussed in Affymetrix' Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 and other SEC reports, including its Form 10-Q reports for subsequent periods. Affymetrix expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in Affymetrix' expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statements are based.

under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
   Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
   Item 4.02 Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review
(a) On August 9, 2006, Affymetrix, Inc. announced that as a result of its previously announced internal review into historical stock option granting practices, Affymetrix will restate its financial statements for certain options granted between 1997 and 1999. Affymetrix concluded on August 9, 2006 that as a result of the restatement, the financial statements contained in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 and its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 should no longer be relied upon. Affymetrix' management and the Audit Committee have discussed the matters disclosed in this filing with Ernst & Young LLP, Affymetrix' independent registered public accounting firm.
     
Affymetrix issued a press release on August 9, 2006, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
   Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits.
      The following exhibit is furnished herewith:
     
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
August 9, 2006. Affymetrix, Inc. (Nasdaq: AFFX) announced that as a result of its previously announced internal review into historical stock option granting practices it will restate its financial statements for certain options granted between 1997 and 1999. The review identified certain documentation lapses but did not find any pattern or practice of inappropriately identifying grant dates with hindsight in order to provide "discounted" or "in-the-money" grants.
The restatement is currently expected to reflect additional non-cash compensation expense from 1997 to 2003, the vesting period of the options. The restatement is also expected to reflect a tax benefit arising from this stock compensation expense. This tax benefit will be recorded in 2005, the year in which the company reduced its valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets. The result will be to increase the company's previously reported net losses from 1997 to 2002, reduce previously reported net income for 2003, and increase its previously reported net income in 2005.
Affymetrix expects to file restated financial statements for the affected periods with the Securities and Exchange Commission during the current quarter. The company has filed a Form 12b-25 with the SEC indicating that its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 will not be filed on schedule. As a result of the restatement, the financial statements contained in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 and its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 should no longer be relied upon.

ITEM: Triggering Events That Accelerate or Increase a Direct Financial Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement
 
     Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant
under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
   
Item 2.04
Triggering Events That Accelerate or Increase a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement.
     
As previously disclosed, the filing of the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 has been delayed in light of the Company's decision to restate its financial statements. As a result of this delay we received on August 17, 2006 a default notice under the indenture governing our $120 million aggregate principal amount 0.75% Senior Convertible Notes due 2033 (the "Notes") from holders purporting to be the beneficial owners of over 25% of the principal amount of the outstanding Notes . The default notice is based upon the indenture covenant requiring us to file with the trustee all reports required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 within fifteen days after they are required to be filed with the SEC.
     
Under the indenture, the Company has 60 days to cure a breach. If the company does not cure the breach within that period, either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes may accelerate the maturity of the Notes, causing the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest to be immediately due and payable. As previously disclosed, the Company expects to file its restated financial statements and its Form 10-Q for the period ending June 30, 2006 by September 30, 2006, which would cure the purported default.
     
All required interest and principal payments have been timely made on the Notes. As of June 30, 2006, the Company had approximately $261 million of cash and short-term investments.
     
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Affymetrix Files Restated Financial Statements
     
Santa Clara, Calif.  August 30, 2006  Affymetrix, Inc. (Nasdaq: AFFX) announced today that it has completed its previously announced restatement of the Company's financial statements. The restated financial statements have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in an amended Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2005 and an amended Form 10-Q/A for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. The Company has also filed its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 which had been delayed due to the restatement. The Company is now current in its SEC reporting obligations and, as a result, expects that the previously disclosed Nasdaq delisting action will be terminated and believes that the previously disclosed notice of default under the Company's indenture has been cured.
     
As previously disclosed, an internal review performed under the direction of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors identified certain errors and documentation lapses in the Company's historic option granting practices but did not find any pattern or practice of inappropriately identifying grant dates with hindsight in order to provide "discounted" or "in-the-money" grants. The Company concluded that as a result of a documentation lapse in July 1999, an option grant for an aggregate of 1.99 million shares should have been measured for accounting purposes as of a later date. In light of the restatement required by this matter, the Company also included in its restatement corrections relating to certain other errors and documentation lapses in the fiscal years 1997 and 1998. Approximately 97% of the charges relating to the restatement arose from the documentation lapse in July 1999.
     
The Company has determined that the cumulative, pre-tax, non-cash, stock-based compensation expense resulting from revised measurement dates for options granted between 1997 and 1999 was approximately $21.5 million. Accordingly, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $0, $0, and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and $19.8 million for the five years preceding 2003, based on the vesting periods of the respective grants. In addition, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $8.3 million in 2005. The adjustments increased previously reported basic and diluted net income per common share by $0.13 and $0.12, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2005 and decreased basic and diluted net income per common share by $0.03 for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
     
On August 30, 2006, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California naming the Company as a nominal defendant and naming several of the Company's current and former officers and directors as defendants. The complaint alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duty by backdating stock option grants, as well as violations of federal securities laws in connection with the dissemination of the Company's financial and proxy statements, violations of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and violations of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The complaint further alleges that the officer defendants were unjustly enriched as a result of their receipt and retention of backdated stock option grants. Plaintiff seeks to recover, on behalf of the Company, unspecified equitable relief and disgorgement of any backdated stock options or the proceeds of any related exercised stock options from the individual officer defendants, as well as an award of attorneys' fees and costs. The Company may be subject to other lawsuits from private plaintiffs concerning this subject area, and the Company does not currently expect to disclose these additional lawsuits which are based on allegations substantially similar to those described above. The Company expects to contest vigorously the backdating allegations in the complaint.

Section 2 - Financial Information
Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
On September 7, 2006, Affymetrix, Inc. (the "Company") committed to a restructuring plan which involves the consolidation and reorganization of its Bedford, Massachusetts based instrumentation manufacturing and development facility. The Company plans to consolidate the Bedford facility's instrument manufacturing operations with the Company's probe array manufacturing facility in West Sacramento, California. The Company's instrumentation development capabilities will be consolidated with its principal research and development facilities located in Santa Clara, California. The restructuring is expected to eliminate or transfer approximately 80 positions beginning in the fourth quarter of 2006 and continuing into the first half of 2007. The Company expects the closure of its Bedford, Massachusetts facility to be materially completed by the third fiscal quarter 2007. These actions were approved as part of the Company's previously announced efforts to reduce expenses in the general and administrative functions including the rationalization of the Company's facilities.
The Company expects to incur costs related to this restructuring, including employee related costs and contract termination costs, but as of the date of this Form 8-K, the Company is unable in good faith to make a more precise determination or estimate or range of estimates of costs expected to be incurred in connection with the restructuring in total or for each major type of cost associated with the restructuring, or of the amount of such costs that will result in additional future cash expenditures. The range of costs and other charges the Company expects to incur in connection with this restructuring is subject to a number of assumptions. The Company is currently preparing its analysis of the restructuring costs and expects to complete its analysis before the end of the current fiscal quarter. Accordingly, as permitted by Item 2.05 of Form 8-K, the Company will file an amendment to this report under Item 2.05 within four business days after the Company's definitive determination of such estimates or range of estimates.
In addition to historical information, this Current Report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from the future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including statements regarding the Company's future financial position and results, are forward-looking statements. All information set forth herein is current as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K. Except as expressly provided herein, Affymetrix undertakes no duty to update any statement in light of new information or future events. For further information regarding risks and uncertainties associated with Affymetrix' business, please refer to the "Risk Factors" section of Affymetrix' SEC filings, including, but not limited to, its annual report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-Q/A.

Section 2 - Financial Information
Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
This Form 8-K/A amends Item 2.05 of the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Affymetrix, Inc. (the "Company") on September 13, 2006. In its September 13, 2006 Form 8-K filing, the Company disclosed that it had committed to a restructuring plan which involves the consolidation and reorganization of its Bedford, Massachusetts based instrumentation manufacturing and development facility. As previously disclosed, the Company plans to consolidate the Bedford facility's instrument manufacturing operations with the Company's probe array manufacturing facility in West Sacramento, California. The Company's instrumentation development capabilities will be consolidated with its principal research and development facilities located in Santa Clara, California. The restructuring is expected to eliminate or transfer approximately 80 positions beginning in the fourth quarter of 2006 and continuing into the first half of 2007. The Company expects the closure of its Bedford, Massachusetts facility to be materially completed by the third fiscal quarter 2007.
In its September 13, 2006 Form 8-K filing, the Company indicated that it expected to incur costs related to this restructuring, including employee related costs and contract termination costs. As of September 13, 2006, the Company was unable in good faith to make a more precise determination or estimate or range of estimates of costs expected to be incurred in connection with the restructuring in total or for each major type of cost associated with the restructuring, or of the amount of such costs that will result in additional future cash expenditures. Pursuant to Item 2.05 of Form 8-K, the Company is filing this Form 8-K/A to announce its determination of such estimates.
The Company estimates that the total restructuring expenses to be incurred in connection with these restructuring actions will be in the range of $15 million to $19 million. Of this total, the Company estimates that $8 million to $10 million relates to employee severance and relocation benefits, $5 million to $7 million relates to contract termination costs associated with vacating the leased Bedford facility, and approximately $2 million relates to other restructuring costs such as fixed asset write downs and equipment and inventory relocation costs. The Company expects that these restructuring expenses will be reflected in its financial results beginning in the third fiscal quarter 2006 and continuing through the third fiscal quarter 2007. Cash outlays incurred in connection with these restructuring activities are estimated to be in the range of $14 million to $18 million.
In addition to historical information, this Current Report on Form 8-K/A contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from the future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Current Report on Form 8-K/A, including statements regarding the Company's future financial position and results, are forward-looking statements. All information set forth herein is current as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K/A. Except as expressly provided herein, Affymetrix undertakes no duty to update any statement in light of new information or future events. For further information regarding risks and uncertainties associated with Affymetrix' business, please refer to the "Risk Factors" section of Affymetrix' SEC filings, including, but not limited to, its annual report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-Q/A.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP, the Company's earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effects of non-cash equity-based stock compensation expense as a result of the Company's adoption of FAS 123R on January 1, 2006.  The Company believes that the presentation of results excluding non-cash equity-based stock compensation expense provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company's core operating results. The Company used the Modified Prospective Method to adopt FAS 123R and did not restate prior year results for the impact of employee stock option expensing.  Therefore, the Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparison of operating results across reporting periods.  A reconciliation between the Company's results of operations on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the periods reported is included as part of the condensed consolidated statements of operations at the end of the Company's earnings release.
The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes.  The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.
All statements in this press release that are not historical are "forward-looking statements" under the federal securities laws. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including but not limited to: risks related to the Company's ability to achieve and sustain higher levels of revenue and improved gross margins and operating income and reduced operating expenses (including risks related to the outcome of the Company's previously announced efforts to reduce expenses in the general and administrative functions including the rationalization of the Company's facilities); uncertainties relating to technological approaches, manufacturing (including risks related to resolving any manufacturing problems) and product development; uncertainties relating to changes in senior management personnel and structure; uncertainties related to cost and pricing of Affymetrix products; risks relating to dependence on collaborative partners; uncertainties relating to sole source suppliers; uncertainties relating to FDA and other regulatory approvals; competition; risks relating to intellectual property of others and the uncertainties of patent protection; and risks relating to intellectual property and other litigation. These and other risk factors are discussed in Affymetrix' Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2005 and other SEC reports, including reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-Q/A for subsequent periods. Affymetrix expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in Affymetrix' expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statements are based.

The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2005 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date included in the Company's Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005.
Note 1:
                            
 
Explanations for Non-GAAP adjustments included in table above:
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006, the Company has added back stock-based compensation expense recorded under FAS 123R to compute its non-GAAP operating results.
(1)
                              
Amount reflects the estimated tax impact on the above noted non-GAAP adjustments.
(2)
                              
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006, the Company did not adjust the shares used in computing non-GAAP diluted net loss per share to conform to what the diluted shares would had been had it applied prior accounting standards as the Company was in a loss position.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On December 22, 2006, Affymetrix, Inc. ("Affymetrix") and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. ("Roche") amended the license agreement associated with the parties' January 29, 2003 non-exclusive licensing and distribution arrangement in which Affymetrix granted Roche access to its patented GeneChip brand technologies for up to 18 years in order to develop and commercialize diagnostic products in a broad range of human disease areas.  Under the terms of the amendment, Roche is relieved of certain future license installment payments that would have been payable by Roche to Affymetrix under the agreement beginning in 2008, Affymetrix is relieved of certain "most favorable terms and conditions" obligations to Roche, and Roche has agreed to pay to Affymetrix additional milestone payments related to future commercial achievements.  The license agreement is subject to Roche's option to terminate on December 31, 2010 or any time on or after December 31, 2015, with one year's prior notice.  As part of the arrangement between the parties, Affymetrix will continue to manufacture and supply Roche with microarrays and related instrumentation based on Affymetrix' GeneChip platform.  In addition, Affymetrix continues to recognize Roche's one-time, upfront payment of $70 million under the license agreement, which was paid to Affymetrix in the first quarter of 2003, as a component of product related revenue over the estimated research and development period of approximately five years beginning in January 2003.

The Collaboration Agreements also include the P450 Addendum Agreement among the Parties dated June 24, 2003, the Amendment Agreement among the Parties dated February 17, 2004, and the Amendment Agreement among the Parties dated December 8, 2004.  All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Common Terms Agreement.
"Collaboration Agreements"
The Parties now desire to amend and supplement the Collaboration Agreements on the terms set forth herein.
The Parties therefore agree as follows:
1.
              
Installment Payments.
Roche is hereby relieved of its obligations to pay License Installment Payments under Section III(b) of the License Agreement (as amended), and such section is hereby deleted in its entirety.
2.
              
Most Favorable Terms and Conditions.
Affymetrix is hereby relieved of its obligations under Section IV(k)(i), IV(k)(ii) and IV(k)(iii) of the License Agreement (as amended), and such sections are hereby deleted in their entirety. In addition, Affymetrix' notice obligations under Section IV(k)(v) of the License Agreement (as amended) shall apply only with respect to the running royalty rate in a Third Party license and, if the Third Party license was entered into in conjunction with a chip supply arrangement, the Chip transfer or sales price.
3.
              
Milestone Payments.
(a)
                                 
Section III(d)(i) of the License Agreement (as amended) is hereby further amended to read in full as follows:
(i) Upon the earlier to occur of (A) initial Regulatory Approval for a particular Diagnostic Product in any of the United States, Japan or Germany, or (B) commercial aggregate gross sales for a particular Diagnostic Product in the United States of at least $[***] over four consecutive calendar quarters, then for such Diagnostic Product:
(1)
                                 
US$[***] if Affymetrix has contributed substantially to the Content of such Diagnostic Product; or
(2)
                                 
US$[***] if Affymetrix has not contributed substantially to the Content of such Diagnostic Product; and
(b)
                                
The US$[***] aggregate maximum on Milestone Payments payable under Section III(d) of the License Agreement (as amended) is removed, but the Parties hereby agree that, notwithstanding clauses (i) and (ii) (as amended) in such Section III(d),
(i) if the aggregate amount of all prior Milestone Payments does not exceed US$[***] but an additional Milestone Payment will bring the aggregate amount of all Milestone Payments above $[***], then the portion of the additional Milestone Payment which causes such amount to be exceeded shall be the lesser of (x) the amount otherwise due without regard to this clause (ii) and (y) an amount to be negotiated by the Parties that shall in no event be less than US$[***] nor more than US$[***], and
(ii) if the aggregate amount of all prior Milestone Payments exceeds US$[***] then the amount of each additional Milestone Payment shall be an amount to be negotiated by the Parties that shall in no event be less than US$[***] nor more than US$[***], and
(iii) if the aggregate amount of all prior Milestone Payments exceeds US$[***], then any additional Milestone Payment shall only be achieved and payable if and when initial Regulatory Approval for the relevant Diagnostic Product has been achieved in the United States and Germany, and commercial aggregate gross sales for such Diagnostic Product have reached at least $[***] worldwide.
(c)
                                 
The Milestone Payments defined in Section III(d)(i) (as amended) already reflect the [***]% reduction described in Section 3(a) of the December 08, 2004 Amendment Agreement. Accordingly, no portion of such Milestone Payments shall be deleted or creditable against future royalties payable under Section III(c) of the License Agreement.
(d)
                                
Nothing in this Section 3(b) of this Amendment shall alter the provisions of Section 3(b) of the December 08, 2004 Amendment Agreement with regards to the maximum quarterly Milestone Payments.
4.
              
Roche Discretion.
  By entering into this Amendment, Roche has elected not to give an Early Termination Notice with respect to the optional termination effective date of December 31, 2007. Accordingly, Roche hereby waives its early termination rights (including full termination and Partial Termination) as provided in Section VI(b) of the License Agreement (as supplemented and amended) with respect to such date. For clarity, nothing in this Amendment shall in any way limit Roche's complete discretion to give an Early Termination Notice (whether relating to a full termination or a Partial Termination) with respect to any subsequent optional termination effective dates in accordance with the Collaboration Agreements (as amended) for any or no reason.
5.
              
General Provisions.
(a)
         
Collaboration Agreement.
  For all purposes of the Collaboration Agreements, this Amendment shall constitute a Collaboration Agreement, and the definition of the term "Collaboration Agreements" in the Common Terms Agreement is hereby amended accordingly.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Section VI (General) of the Common Terms Agreement shall apply to this Amendment and is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.
(b)
        
Relation to Other Collaboration Agreements.
  As amended by this Amendment, the Collaboration Agreements remain in full force and effect.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF the Parties have executed this Amendment.

Recent Highlights
Management
Affymetrix strengthened its management team by appointing Kevin King as president of life sciences business and executive vice president, reporting to Stephen Fodor, Ph.D., chairman and CEO.
                 
DNA Analysis
In December 2006, Affymetrix began shipping its new single-chip Genome Wide 5.0 Array in limited release. The array features SNPs from the original two-chip 500K Array Set, as well as 500,000 additional probes that can measure other genetic differences, such as copy number variation. The Genome Wide 5.0 Array gives researchers a significant increase in information above the original 500K Array Set for the same price, while reducing the array processing time.  The Genome Wide 5.0 Array was developed in collaboration with the Broad Institute of Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
                 
Affymetrix scientists participated on the International Genome Structural Variation Consortium's Copy Number Variation Project generating the first comprehensive copy number variation (CNV) map of the human genome. The team discovered hundreds of CNVs that will enable researchers to perform more powerful association studies on
                 
 diseases such as cancer, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. The results of this study were published in the November 23, 2006 issue of Nature along with a supporting paper in Genome Research.  This work highlights the importance of copy number variation in genetics and opens up new avenues in future genetic studies.
Using the Affymetrix 500K Array Set, researchers at Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen) screened DNA samples from over 1,200 patients with sporadic ALS and 2,000 controls to identify more than 50 genetic abnormalities in people with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease).
                 
RNA Analysis
Peer reviewed publications have begun to demonstrate the value of Exon Arrays in biomarker discovery.  For example, researchers at University of Manchester's Paterson Institute for Cancer Research found a high degree of gene level correlation between the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays and GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST Arrays while at the same time resolving splice variations.  This study was published in the January 2007 issue of Biotechniques.
                 
Two recent publications have reported the development of new statistical methods for analyzing data from Affymetrix Exon Arrays.  Published December 2006 in PLoS One, researchers from Stanford University showed that gene level expression obtained from Exon Arrays is more representative of the true transcriptional activity of each gene.  Additionally, a research team from University of Tokyo developed a new statistical method to identify differentially observed splicing variations from Exon expression profiles in the October 2006 issue of Genome Informatics.  These publications are paving the way for further standardization of analysis tools for Exon arrays and broader adoption by the research community.
                 
Molecular Diagnostics
The Company continued to expand its international molecular diagnostics business by entering into agreements with Sysmex of Kobe, Japan. The agreements grant Sysmex exclusive rights to distribute Affymetrix' diagnostic microarray products and instruments in Japan with the opportunity to expand into certain Asia Pacific countries.  In addition, as a Powered by Affymetrix partner Sysmex gains non-exclusive access to Affymetrix microarray technology to develop and market in-vitro diagnostic tests on a worldwide basis.  Sysmex will carry out all registration, sales and customer support activities in Japan.
                 
Emerging Markets
Affymetrix has granted Tessarae Inc. non-exclusive access to its microarray technology to develop and market epidemiological research tests for public health and biodefense surveillance. As part of the Powered by Affymetrix program, the TessArray kits simultaneously detect and identify hundreds of strains of natural and emergent viral and bacterial pathogens, as well as biothreat agents.  The TessArray kits are based on
                 
multiplexed genotypic signatures present on Affymetrix CustomSeq Resequencing Arrays.
Translational Medicine
Affymetrix and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center have entered into a three-year translational research collaboration to analyze genomic information across a large number of patient samples. Under terms of the agreement, researchers at Vanderbilt-Ingram and Vanderbilt University Medical Center will use Affymetrix microarrays to develop new applications for translational research projects, focusing on disease areas such as cancer and HIV/AIDS.
                 
Toxicology
Affymetrix and Iconix Biosciences launched the ToxFX Analysis Suite, a toxicogenomics solution that improves researchers' understanding of safety issues associated with new drug candidates.  ToxFX combines Iconix' automated analysis with Affymetrix arrays, helping scientists prioritize drug candidates and make preclinical development decisions faster.
                 
Licensing
Baylor College of Medicine has obtained a non-exclusive, worldwide license to a number of Affymetrix patents covering comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) microarray services in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) environments.  Baylor joins a growing list of licensees including Nimblegen, Abbott, Invitrogen, Perkin Elmer, Applied Biosystems, and Roche.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP, the Company's earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effects of non-cash equity-based stock compensation expense as a result of the Company's adoption of FAS 123R on January 1, 2006.  The Company believes that the presentation of results excluding non-cash equity-based stock compensation expense provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company's core operating results. The Company used the Modified Prospective Method to adopt FAS 123R and did not restate prior year results for the impact of employee stock option expensing.  Therefore, the Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparison of operating results across reporting periods.  A reconciliation between the Company's results of operations on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the periods reported is included as part of the condensed consolidated statements of operations at the end of the Company's earnings release.
The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes.  The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.
All statements in this press release that are not historical are "forward-looking statements" under the federal securities laws. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including but not limited to: risks related to the Company's ability to achieve and sustain higher levels of revenue and improved gross margins and operating income and reduced operating expenses (including risks related to the outcome of the Company's previously announced efforts to reduce expenses in the general and administrative functions including the rationalization of the Company's facilities); uncertainties relating to technological approaches, manufacturing (including risks related to resolving any manufacturing problems) and product development; uncertainties relating to changes in senior management personnel and structure; uncertainties related to cost and pricing of Affymetrix products; risks relating to dependence on collaborative partners; uncertainties relating to sole source suppliers; uncertainties relating to FDA and other regulatory approvals; competition; risks relating to intellectual property of others and the uncertainties of patent protection; and risks relating to intellectual property and other litigation. These and other risk factors are discussed in Affymetrix' Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2005 and other SEC reports, including reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-Q/A for subsequent periods.

Using the Affymetrix 10K SNP array to screen for gene copy number changes, researchers at University Medical Center Hamburg, University Hospital Basel and the King Faisal Specialist Hospital, Riyadh identified an estrogen receptor gene, ESR1, which is frequently amplified in breast cancer.  Published in the April 8, 2007 issue of Nature Genetics, the results suggest ESR1 amplification may be prevalent in proliferative breast disease and may appear as an early genetic marker of a large number of breast cancers.
                 
RNA Analysis
Affymetrix launched its GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Array, the latest addition to its whole-transcript assay-based gene expression product family. The Human Gene 1.0 ST Array is a cost-effective gene expression profiling option for new microarray users. Its affordable price and simplified workflow will enable more scientists to incorporate microarray technology in their research more often.
                 
The Company announced the commercial launch of its GeneChip HT Array Plate System, a full microarray processing platform that analyzes up to 96 samples at a time. The HT Array Plates offer the same comprehensive, validated content as the traditional cartridges in a format designed for larger-scale studies. The complete system increases productivity for large-scale gene expression studies by decreasing processing time, improving data consistency and reducing overall costs.
                 
Molecular Diagnostics
The Company announced that the Affymetrix Clinical Services Laboratory (ACSL) successfully passed the State of California survey for CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) certification on April 9, 2007. The State of California inspector gave ACSL permission to begin offering microarray-based molecular diagnostic patient and clinical trial testing services.  These services are designed to improve healthcare and help customers develop personalized tests and therapies faster than ever before.
                 
Partnerships
Affymetrix and NuGEN Technologies Inc. announced their agreement to co-market a solution that enables researchers to access FFPE (formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded) tissue samples derived from years of clinical studies previously inaccessible by traditional RNA amplification methods.
                 
The Company announced the launch of the Collaborations in Cancer Research Program, an alliance between Affymetrix and up to 30 leading European cancer researchers. As part of the program, Affymetrix will partially fund selected research projects that demonstrate clinical utility, enabling participants to develop new approaches to elucidate cancer mechanisms and to accelerate discoveries in more than 10 different forms of cancer.
                 
Litigation
Affymetrix announced that the United States District Court for the District of Delaware returned a verdict in favor of Affymetrix in its patent infringement suit against Illumina Inc. The jury found that Illumina's arrays, scanners, software, and related products infringed on one or more claims of all five of Affymetrix' patents-in-suit (5,535,531, 5,795,716, 6,355,432, 6,399,365, and 6,646,243). The jury found that the proper royalty rate was 15 percent, and awarded total damages of more than $16 million for the period of 2002-2005.

Quarterly Highlights
DNA Analysis
Affymetrix announced the launch of its Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0, a single microarray that simultaneously measures more than 1.8 million genetic markers. Developed in collaboration with the Broad Institute of Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the new array offers industry-leading performance which enables researchers to increase the size and scope of their experiments.
                 
The Children's Research Institute and Affymetrix have entered a five year alliance to screen genetic information of up to 25,000 patients.  The study will use Affymetrix products to generate genetic data for use in developing novel diagnostics and screening tests for complex diseases affecting children.
                 
The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) completed the world's largest whole-genome association project. The research team used GeneChip microarray technology to analyze the genetic information of more than 17,000 individuals to find genes associated with seven common complex human diseases.  Study details were published in the June 7, 2007 issue of Nature.
                 
The National Genome Research Network (NGFN) in Germany has selected the Affymetrix SNP Arrays 5.0 and 6.0 to genotype more than 17,000 individuals. With this genetic information, researchers will develop treatments for 25 complex diseases, including Alzheimer's, epilepsy, and Parkinson's.
                 
The Republic of Korea's National Institute of Health (NIH) and Center for Disease Control and Prevention will use the Affymetrix SNP Array 5.0 for the Korean Association REsource (KARE) project. This genome-wide association study is designed to identify the genetic causes of lifestyle-related complex diseases that are prevalent in Korea by genotyping 10,000 individuals.
                 
The Genetic Association Information Network (GAIN) will use the recently launched SNP Array 6.0 for a series of studies designed to identify the genetic causes of common, complex diseases such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. GAIN researchers will use the Affymetrix technology to analyze 8,000 samples with a diverse range of ethnic origins.
                 
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia will use the Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 for whole-genome association studies of 7,000 individuals. "The increased genetic coverage, expanded content and affordability of the Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 enables us to perform highly powered association and copy number studies, which will provide us with a better understanding of the role of genes and genetic variants in complex diseases," said Hakon Hakonarson, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Center for Applied Genomics at Children's Hospital.
                 
RNA Analysis
A team from Affymetrix Laboratories has successfully used the Company's Tiling Arrays to help redefine the structure of the human genome as part of the ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project. Organized by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the ENCODE pilot-phase project was a four-year set of studies designed to identify the functional elements present in one percent of the human genome.
                 
The results of the project were published in a set of papers in the June 14th issue of Nature and the June issue of Genome Research.
Molecular Diagnostics
Affymetrix Clinical Services Laboratory has signed a co-marketing agreement with DOCRO Inc., a leading contract research organization that specializes in the commercialization of in vitro diagnostic (IVD) biomarker technologies. The two companies will work together to help customers gain clearance or approval of IVD products from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and bring those products to market faster than before.
                 
Partners HealthCare and Affymetrix have extended their translational research collaboration.  Under the terms of the agreement, Affymetrix will create custom microarrays based on the recent discovery data from Partners researchers. The arrays will be used to produce molecular diagnostic tests, which will then be validated in Partners HealthCare's CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments)-certified environments.
                 
Management
Affymetrix appointed John C. Batty to chief financial officer and executive vice president, reporting to Stephen P.A. Fodor, Ph.D., chairman and CEO.  Prior to his appointment, Batty served as senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer of Credence Systems Corporation.

Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On November 16, 2007, Affymetrix, Inc. ("Affymetrix") issued $275,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.50% Senior Convertible Notes due 2038 (the "Notes") pursuant to an Indenture dated as of November 16, 2007 between Affymetrix and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Indenture").  A copy of the Indenture is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference, and the following summary is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Indenture.
 
The Notes will bear interest at the rate of 3.50% per annum.  Interest on the Notes is payable on January 15 and July 15 of each year beginning on July 15, 2008.  The Notes will mature on January 15, 2038.
 
Holders of the Notes may convert their notes into shares of Affymetrix common stock at any time and from time to time prior to January 15, 2038.  The conversion rate will initially be 33.1991 shares of Affymetrix common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $30.12 per share of common stock.  The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.  In addition, Affymetrix will increase the conversion rate for holders who elect to convert Notes in connection with certain fundamental change transactions occurring on or prior to January 15, 2013 as described in the Indenture.
 
Affymetrix may not redeem the Notes before January 15, 2013.  On or after that date, Affymetrix may redeem all or part of the Notes for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed.
 
Holders of the Notes may require Affymetrix to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes on January 15, 2013, 2018 and 2028 at 100% of the principal amount of the Notes.  Holders may also require Affymetrix to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes, subject to specified exceptions, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change specified in the Indenture at  a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes.
 
The Notes will be unsecured and will rank equally with Affymetrix' other existing and future senior indebtedness.  The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of Affymetrix' subsidiaries.
 
The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may declare the principal of the Notes and any accrued and unpaid interest through the date of such declaration immediately due and payable.  In the case of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency relating to Affymetrix or any of its subsidiaries, the principal amount of the Notes together with any accrued and unpaid interest through the occurrence of such event shall automatically become and be immediately due and payable.

SECTION 13.06.    The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company as follows:
Adjustment of Conversion Rate.
 
(a)  If the Company issues shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on Common Stock, or if the Company effects a stock split or stock combination, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
where,
 
 
 
An adjustment made pursuant to this subsection (a) shall become effective immediately after the record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of subdivision or combination.
 
(b)  If the Company issues to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock any rights or warrants entitling them for a period of not more than 60 days after the Ex-dividend Date for such issuance to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the time of announcement of such issuance, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula ( that the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the extent that such rights or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration):
provided
 
where,
 
 
Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such rights or warrants are issued, and shall become effective on the Ex-dividend Date of such issuance.
 
(c)  If the Company distributes shares of its Capital Stock, evidences of its indebtedness or other assets or property to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock, excluding (1) dividends, distributions and rights or warrants referred to in clause (a) or (b) above and (2) dividends or distributions in cash referred to in clause (d) below, then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:

Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective on the Ex-dividend Date for such distribution. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. If the Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the market price of the Common Stock as provided above.

In the event that the Company has in effect a preferred shares rights plan (""), upon conversion of the Securities into Common Stock, to the extent that the Rights Plan is still in effect upon such conversion, the Holders of Securities shall receive, in addition to the Common Stock, the rights described therein (whether or not the

rights have separated from the Common Stock at the time of conversion), subject to the limitations set forth in the Rights Plan. If the Rights Plan provides that upon separation of rights under such plan from the Common Stock that the Holders would not be entitled to receive any such rights in respect of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted as provided in this (with such separation deemed to be the distribution of such rights), subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of the rights. Any distribution of rights or warrants pursuant to a Rights Plan that would allow a Holder to receive upon conversion, in addition to the Common Stock, the rights described therein (whether or not the rights have separated from the Common Stock at the time of conversion), shall not constitute a distribution of rights or warrants pursuant to this .

If any such right or warrant, including any such existing rights or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and record date with respect to new rights or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this was made, (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants which shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights or warrants which shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights and warrants had not been issued.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., Dec. 18, 2007 
Affymetrix Inc.
(Nasdaq: AFFX) announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire USB Corporation, a privately held Cleveland, Ohio-based company that develops, manufactures and markets an extensive line of molecular biology and biochemical reagent products. The acquisition will enable Affymetrix to accelerate the development and commercialization of new genetic analysis solutions and increase the value of its current product portfolio.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, Affymetrix will pay approximately $75 million in cash to acquire USB. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2008, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.
 
"The integration of USB's biochemical reagents with Affymetrix' current and future products will greatly accelerate our ability to develop and commercialize more complete customer solutions," said Kevin King, president of Affymetrix. "USB is a recognized leader in the life sciences industry with strong brand equity and established manufacturing capabilities. This acquisition is a strategic fit for Affymetrix' growth strategy and we expect it to be modestly accretive to our 2008 earnings per share, before anticipated charges relating to the transaction."
 
USB is a leading developer, manufacturer and supplier of enzymes, reagents and kits for life sciences research and industrial applications. The company's offerings are grouped into three major product lines consisting of molecular biology enzymes and kits, biochemical reagents and products used in membrane protein research applications. The company history extends back to the 1970s, known then as United States Biochemical. In 1993, United States Biochemical was purchased by Amersham Life Science, a company that later merged with Swedish-owned Pharmacia Biotech in 1997. The current USB Corporation was founded in 1998 after members of the senior management team acquired the three original product lines back from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.
 
"Affymetrix is a pioneer in the life science research market that continues to set the standard in genetic analysis by successfully commercializing its innovations," said Mike Lachman, CEO and president of USB. "The USB and Affymetrix combination drives higher customer value today and opens the door to new and emerging market opportunities for tomorrow."
 
Affymetrix will discuss the impact of this acquisition during the fourth quarter and fiscal 2007 year-end earnings call, which is scheduled for January 31, 2008 at 2:00 p.m. PT. Affymetrix will provide dial-in information for this call by January 17, 2008.
 
About
USB
 
USB Corporation has a long-standing reputation as a leader in the life sciences, fueling innovation in basic research, drug discovery and molecular diagnostics. The company's history reaches back to the 1970s, known then as United States Biochemical, a company that specialized in supplying biochemicals to the research market. In the 1980s, a collaboration with scientists (Tabor & Richardson) at Harvard University led to the commercialization of Sequenase
 DNA Polymerase and the first easy-to-use DNA sequencing kits. This technology pioneered development of themostable enzymes and automation for high-throughput sequencing.
 
In 1993, United States Biochemical was purchased by Amersham Life Science, a British company that later merged with Swedish-owned Pharmacia Biotech in 1997. At that time, members of the senior management team at USB acquired three of the original main product lines: molecular biology enzymes, biochemicals and manual DNA sequencing reagents. These products formed the basis of the current USB Corporation, founded in 1998. For more information on USB, please visit the company's website at http://www.usbweb.com/.

Recent Highlights
 
DNA Analysis
 
Scientists at University of Ottawa Heart Institute (UOHI) will use the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 for its whole-genome association study on coronary artery disease (CAD). Over the next three years, researchers at UOHI will use the array to screen the DNA of more than 12,000 individuals to not only confirm their previous findings, but also to identify new associations that provide scientists with a better understanding of how to identify and develop personalized treatments for the causes of CAD.
                 
 
Affymetrix announced the Coriell Institute for Medical Research will use the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 for a series of whole-genome association studies for the Delaware Valley Personalized Medicine Project. The goal of the project is to identify genes that affect the risk of developing cancer, heart and blood vessel diseases, lung disease, as well as stroke and other complex health conditions. Scientists at Coriell will conduct studies on DNA samples from 10,000 individuals initially, with the ultimate goal of reaching 100,000 participants.
                 
 
Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School used the Affymetrix 500K array set and a modified protocol to examine expression
                 
 
of maternally and paternally derived alleles.  Published in the November 16, 2007 issue of Science, scientists found in a genome-wide scan of 4000 human genes that in over 300 only the maternal or paternal allele was expressed.  Termed monoallelic expression, the relatively high occurrence of this genetic phenomenon may be a source of human diversity.
levels
 
RNA Analysis
 
Scientists at the Salk Institute used GeneChip Exon 1.0ST arrays to study human embryonic stem cells and neural progenitor cells.  Published in the October 3, 2007 issue of PLoS Computational Biology, researchers introduced a new methodology for Exon Array analysis, leading to new insights into the complexity of alternative splicing in human embryonic stem cells and their transition to neural stem cells.
                 
 
Researchers at McGill University and collaborators used GeneChip Exon 1.0ST arrays to examine correlations between SNPs and expression of transcript isoforms.  Published in the January 13, 2008 issue of Nature Genetics, scientists detected 324 genes with significant associations between flanking SNPs and transcript levels.  The study results indicate that regulatory effects of genetic variation in a normal human population may be far more complex than previously observed, which could account for natural phenotypic variation and disease susceptibility.
                 
 
Drug Metabolism
 
Affymetrix announced the availability of its Drug Metabolizing Enzymes and Transporters (DMET) Early Access solution, currently the world's most comprehensive method for assaying the genetics of drug metabolism. The DMET offering profiles more than 1,069 drug metabolism biomarkers, including 172 "core" genetic markers, enabling pharma researchers to assess all clinically relevant ADME markers in a single assay.
                 
 
Targeted Arrays
 
Affymetrix announced the launch of the MyGeneChip(TM) Program, which offers custom gene expression and genotyping arrays for plant and animal genomes.  MyGeneChip Custom Arrays utilize the same proven GeneChip technology that has been the industry standard in microarray research for the past decade.  In addition to whole-genome 3' in vitro transcript expression and resequencing arrays, researchers may now order custom whole-transcript expression, tiling and genotyping arrays to explore plant and animal genomes in greater detail than ever before.
                 
 
Molecular Diagnostics
 
The Company announced that its GeneChip technology will form the foundation of the new molecular cytogenetic service offering by Laboratory Corporation of America.  The new service will correlate deletions, gains and other chromosomal rearrangements with congenital diseases such as autism, mental retardation and
                 
 
delay in children. Affymetrix' genotyping technology will enable high resolution analysis of copy number changes and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) not possible with traditional karyotype or FISH technologies.
developmental
 
Affymetrix partner Navigenics, Inc. announced their official corporate launch, naming a team of advisers and investors from leading communities in science, medicine, technology and public policy who are supporting the company.   Navigenics educates and empowers customers with knowledge of their genetic predispositions, and then motivates them to act on the information to prevent the onset of disease, achieve earlier diagnosis, appropriately manage disease, or otherwise lessen its impact.  The company has a signed agreement with Affymetrix to provide lab services via its CLIA-certified laboratory in Sacramento, California.
                 
 
Software
 
Affymetrix announced the availability of its Genotyping Console(TM) 2.0 (GTC 2.0) Software, an easy-to-use analysis tool for determining single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes and chromosomal copy number changes in whole-genome association and cytogenetic studies. GTC 2.0 works together with the Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 to offer researchers up to 10 times the sensitivity for detecting copy number changes than competing platforms. The new features of GTC 2.0 make it easier for researchers to extract and interpret both inherited and novel copy number changes.
                 
 
The Company announced the full commercial launch of Affymetrix GeneChip Command Console  Software, which in conjunction with Expression Console(TM) and Genotyping Console, provides scientists with integrated laboratory and data analysis workflows to suit their growing research requirements.   The Command Console offers customers a new paradigm in instrument control and genomic data organization software.

(Nasdaq: AFFX), today reported that based on preliminary financial data, the Company expects total revenue for the first quarter of 2008 to be approximately $170 million, including an intellectual property payment of $90 million received by the Company in connection with a previously announced settlement of patent litigation.
 
For fiscal year 2008, the Company has reduced its full-year revenue guidance from the previous range of $505 to $525 million to a new range of $490 to $510 million, a decrease of approximately 3%. This reduction in revenue expectations for the full year is primarily the result of expected lower research spending by pharmaceutical and industrial customers. The Company is currently reviewing ways to further reduce operating expenses to offset the impact of this revenue reduction.
 
The Company will release first quarter operating results and host a conference call after the close of the market on April 24, 2008. A live webcast can be accessed by visiting the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at www.affymetrix.com.

On July 1, 2008, we were named as a defendant in a complaint filed by plaintiffs E8 Pharmaceuticals LLC and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States District Court of Massachusetts.

Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On July 24, 2008, Affymetrix, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing the Company's operating results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2008.  A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
The information furnished under Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibit, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into Affymetrix' filings with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
 
Earlier this year, we committed to a restructuring plan designed to optimize our production capacity and cost structure and improve our future gross margins.  The restructuring plan was approved as part of our ongoing efforts to reduce costs and involved moving the majority of our probe array manufacturing from our West Sacramento, California facility to our Singapore facility.  In connection with these restructuring activities, for the six months ended June 30, 2008, we incurred a restructuring charge of $14.8 million.
 
On July 21, 2008, we decided to expand our restructuring plan by closing our West Sacramento manufacturing facility.  Following the closure of our West Sacramento manufacturing facility, all of our products will be manufactured out of our Singapore and Cleveland, Ohio facilities, as well as by third parties.  In addition to the charges incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2008, we expect to incur a total of approximately $42 million in charges related to this expansion of our restructuring plan.  Of this total, we expect that approximately $22 million will be included as a component of total cost of product sales, $17 million of which relates to accelerated depreciation charges associated with the continued use of certain long-lived manufacturing assets and $5 million of which relates to manufacturing transition and other costs.  Additionally, we expect to include approximately $20 million in the line item labeled "restructuring charges" in our consolidated statements of operations, $11 million of which relates to impairment charges primarily related to the facility itself and to certain long-lived manufacturing assets and $9 million related to employee severance costs.
 
We expect the closure of the West Sacramento facility to be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter of 2009.  We expect to incur approximately $26 million of the charges relating to the closure of the West Sacramento facility during the remainder of fiscal 2008 and approximately $16 million of charges in 2009. The estimated cash outlays to be incurred in connection with these restructuring activities are estimated to be approximately $13 million.  Depending on the rate at which we transfer our production capacity out of our West Sacramento facility, we may incur additional expenses.
 
In addition to historical information, this Current Report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including statements regarding our future financial position and results, are forward-looking statements. For further information regarding risks and uncertainties associated with our business, please refer to our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, the "Risk Factors" section of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 and all subsequent quarterly reports.

Affymetrix Inc., (Nasdaq: AFFX) today reported its operating results for the second quarter of 2008.  Total revenue for the quarter was $86.9 million, as compared to total revenue of $88.3 million in the second quarter of 2007.
Santa Clara, Calif.  July 24, 2008
 
Product revenue was $75.0 million, which consists of array and reagent revenue of $68.9 million and instrument revenue of $6.1 million.  Service revenue was $9.0 million, and royalties and other revenue were $2.9 million for the second quarter of 2008.  This compares to second quarter 2007 product revenue of $68.4 million.  Service revenue was $12.0 million, and royalties and other revenue were $7.9 million for the second quarter of 2007.  Affymetrix shipped 22 GeneChip systems in the quarter, bringing its cumulative systems shipped to 1,761 at the end of the second quarter.
 
The Company reported net loss of approximately $3.6 million or $0.05 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2008, which includes a pretax restructuring charge of $0.9 million or $0.01 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $1.2 million or $0.02 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2007, which included a pretax restructuring charge of $1.8 million or $0.03 per diluted share.
 
Cost of product sales was $32.3 million in the second quarter of 2008 compared to $25.7 million in the same period of 2007.  Cost of services was $6.7 million compared to $10.8 million in the second quarter of 2007.

Updated Financial Outlook for 2008
 
Due to predicted ongoing weakness in the Company's pharmaceutical revenue, the Company now expects 2008 revenue to be in the range of $455 million to $460 million, including a one-time $90 million payment.  Total gross margin is expected to be approximately 65 percent, of which 9 points is expected to be attributable to the one-time $90 million payment.  The Company expects total operating expenses between $262 million to $267 million, including total restructuring charges of approximately $32 million and acquisition related charges of $21 million.
 
Operations
 
Affymetrix announces its plan to consolidate manufacturing to three locations.  These manufacturing consolidations are expected to improve capacity utilization, increase operational efficiencies and expand the Company's product gross margin.
                 
 
Acquisitions
 
In July, Affymetrix completed an acquisition of a privately held San Francisco-based company that develops digitally encoded microparticle technology for approximately $25 million in cash.  This high performance and flexible platform technology will enable the Company to enter low to mid-multiplex markets and compete with bead-based platforms.  In addition, this technology is applicable to the research, applied, and diagnostic markets.

Affymetrix, Inc.
(Nasdaq: AFFX), today reported that based on preliminary financial data, the Company expects total revenue for the third quarter of 2008 to be approximately $75 million. Global sales fell below expectations for the quarter driven by increased competition for academic research funding and continued softness in industrial spending.

"While in the near term we expect that research budgets will remain tight, we believe the long term growth opportunity in the genetic analysis markets remains attractive," said Stephen P.A. Fodor, chairman and chief executive officer of Affymetrix. "We believe that the Company's priorities are aligned to meet this challenge. We are reengineering our platform to offer our customers a range of new products that are more flexible and cost effective in 2009.  In addition, our strong balance sheet will enable us to continue to invest in our business."
 
The Company will release third quarter operating results and host a conference call after the close of the market on October 23, 2008.

Affymetrix shipped 29 GeneChip systems in the quarter, bringing its cumulative systems shipped to 1,790 at the end of the third quarter.
 
The Company reported net loss of approximately $31.8 million or $0.46 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2008, which includes a pretax restructuring charge of $14.6 million or $0.21 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $2.6 million or $0.04 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2007, which included a pretax restructuring charge of $5.7 million or $0.08 per diluted share.
 
Cost of product sales was $32.3 million in the third quarter of 2008 compared to $28.2 million in the same period of 2007.  Cost of services was $5.8 million compared to $7.3 million in the third quarter of 2007.  Product gross margin was 51.0 percent in the third quarter of 2008, including the impact of $3.1 million of accelerated depreciation for Sacramento manufacturing assets whose remaining useful life was shortened as a result of the closing of our West Sacramento facility.  This compares to 59.5 percent in the third quarter of 2007.
 
Operating expenses were $68.8 million for the third quarter of 2008, which includes restructuring charges of $14.6 million and acquisition related charges of $5.1 million, as compared to $55.5 million in the third quarter of 2007, which included restructuring charges of $5.7 million.
 
Financial Outlook for Q4 2008
 
The Company expects the fourth quarter revenue to be essentially flat to third quarter levels and total revenue for the year in the range of $408 million to $415 million, including the first quarter Intellectual Property payment of $90 million.  Total gross margin is expected to be approximately 63 percent, of which 10 points is expected to be attributable to the one-time $90 million payment.  The Company expects total operating expenses between $240 million to $243 million, including total restructuring charges of approximately $33 million and acquisition related charges of $6 million.
 
Subsequent to the end of the third quarter of 2008, the decline in the Company's stock price led to the Company's market value falling below its net equity value, along with other conditions in its business, which are defined as indicators of impairment of goodwill and other intangibles under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Therefore, the Company is required to assess whether or not an impairment of its intangible assets has occurred and will be conducting an evaluation of the fair market value of these and other assets, including our deferred tax assets.  The Company expects to complete its impairment analysis during the fourth quarter.
Goodwill and Other Intangibles.

John Batty, CFO of Affymetrix, stated:
 
Kevin King, CEO of Affymetrix, said: "In 2008, we made steady progress on our corporate goals, including reengineering our technology platform, expanding into new markets, and creating greater operating leverage. We also completed three acquisitions that support all of these objectives, positioning Affymetrix to serve a broader range of our customers' needs, especially in the growing markets downstream of our whole genome arrays."
 
Recent Highlights
 
DNA Analysis
 
In November, the Company announced the launch of the DMET Plus Premier Pack, a comprehensive and cost-effective method for standardizing drug metabolism studies. The DMET (Drug Metabolism Enzymes and Transporters) Plus panel features markers in all FDA-validated genes and covers more than 90 percent of the current ADME Core markers as defined by the PharmaADME group. In total, it provides 1,936 high-value drug metabolism and transporter markers.
                 
The Coriell Personalized Medicine Collaborative (CPMC), part of the Coriell Institute for Medical Research, selected our DMET Plus Product for a national project to identify biologically relevant markers for drug response. The CPMC has been using the Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 to identify genes associated with complex health conditions, such as cancer, heart and blood vessel diseases, and diabetes. With the DMET Plus Product, the CPMC will expand these investigations to include direct interrogation of markers for drug metabolism and transport to build a database of genetic information related to drug response.
                 
 
Molecular Diagnostics
 
Pathwork Diagnostics, Inc. announced the launch of an additional version of the Pathwork Tissue of Origin Test that analyzes formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples. The capability to work with FFPE samples will enable the test to be more broadly utilized by oncologists and pathologists.
                 
Researchers at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center used Affymetrix technology to develop the first gene chipthe Jaundice Chipthat can be used for early diagnosis of at least five hereditary liver diseases. Jaundice occurs in about one out of every 2,200 live births in the U.S. With this new test, about half of all pediatric chronic liver disease cases can be detected
                 
 
 
early and appropriate treatments begun right away. This innovative molecular diagnostic test can detect genetic causes of jaundice in children and adults, and potentially could lead to personalized treatment options. Cincinnati Children's has made the CLIA- and CAP-approved laboratory developed test available to clinicians around the world.
Scientists at Cancer Research UK Cambridge Research Institute recently discovered the molecular basis for tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells using Affymetrix Tiling Arrays. Tamoxifen is prescribed to most women for five years after they are first diagnosed with breast cancer to help prevent recurrence of the disease. Resistance, or non-response, to the drug is a significant problem, affecting between 25 and 35 percent of breast cancer patients. Knowing which women will not respond to tamoxifen therapy will allow physicians to pursue alternate therapies that will be more effective, and understanding this mechanism of resistance will likely open up new avenues for therapeutic development.
                 
 
Instrumentation
 
The Company announced the commercial launch of the GeneTitan System, the only integrated platform that automates customer workflow from target preparation to array processing to results. The new system maximizes data reproducibility, user productivity, and throughput scalability. The first applicationwhole-genome expression profilingdelivers customers a new, modular 24- and 96-array plate formats with whole-genome content and a new HT 3' IVT Express Assay with a streamlined protocol and significantly lower sample volume and reagent requirements.
                 
 
Corporate
 
In December, the Company completed the acquisition of Panomics Inc., a privately held company in Fremont, California, with products aimed at the high-growth validation and routine testing market segments. This acquisition strengthens Affymetrix' position by providing a more complete customer workflowfrom whole-genome microarray studies to studies of an individual gene. The Panomics product suite includes single and multiplex assays for gene and protein expression, as well as DNA copy number.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Panomics, Inc. as of December 31, 2007, and the related consolidated statement of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
the financial position of Panomics, Inc. at December 31, 2007, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has sustained recurring operating losses and is dependent upon proceeds from additional financing to fund its operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
- Panomics, Inc. (formerly Genospectra, Inc.) (the "Company"), was incorporated in the state of California on April 21, 2000. The Company sells and develops reagent kits and probe sets that quantitatively measure gene expression, transcription regulation, protein interaction, and cell signaling within cells for use in drug discovery and other research and development applications.  Its principal market is the life sciences research market consisting of drug development companies, government research centers, and universities located mainly in the United States and Europe.  Its primary facilities are located in Fremont, California. The Company also has a sales subsidiary located in Italy. The Company's revenues, by geographical area, consisted of the following:
Description of the Company and Business
 
 
- The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Panomics SRL, located in Italy. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Basis of Consolidation
 
- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company's most significant estimates relate to valuation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, inventory valuation, and the value of our common stock and Series Z preferred stock as a private company and related values assigned to share-based payments. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Use of Estimates
 
- Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include, but are not limited to royalties, payroll and personnel expenses, laboratory supplies, and consulting costs.
Research and Development
 
- The Company considers all highly liquid investments in marketable debt securities with a maturity from the date of purchase of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of bank deposits, money market funds, and government and corporate bonds. Investments with maturities ranging from over 90 days to a year are considered short-term investments.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
At December 31, 2007 the Company had restricted cash of $223,782 required to be maintained on deposit for the Company's leased facilities, sales tax payments, escrow account relating to merger and a credit card arrangement.
 
Panomics, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
- The Company's concentration of credit risk consists principally of cash and cash equivalents. The Company's investment policy restricts investments to high quality investments and limits the amounts invested with any one issuer. The Company believes that it has established guidelines for investment of its excess cash that maintain safety and liquidity through its policies on diversification and investment maturity.
Concentration of Credit Risk
 
The Company is also subject to credit risk from its accounts receivable related to product sales. To date, the Company has not experienced losses with respect to the collection of its accounts receivable and believe that all its accounts receivable as reflected in the balance sheet are collectible.
 
During 2007, 19% of revenue recognized was from the Company's top three customers.  No customer contributed more than 10% of sales.  At December 31, 2007 approximately 19% of the trade receivables outstanding were from three customers, who individually made up the following composition of total accounts receivable: 9%, 6%, and 4%.
 
Inventories
- Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first-out method), or market. When necessary, management makes provisions for obsolete, excess and slow-moving inventory.
 
- Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which are three to five years for computer equipment and software and three to seven years for laboratory and office equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the period of lease term or the estimated useful lives of the related assets, whichever is less.
Property and Equipment
 
- Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration paid over the value assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company accounts for its goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, , which requires the Company to test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. To date, based upon management's impairment test, no adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill have been required.
Goodwill
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
 
Long-lived Assets
- - Purchased technology and other identifiable intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. The Company amortizes identifiable intangibles using methods that reflect their pattern of usage or benefit to the company over their estimated useful lives. The range of estimated useful lives on the Company's identifiable intangibles is one to ten years. Acquired in-process technology is expensed during the period of acquisition.
 
The Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS No. 144, . Under this standard, the Company reviews long-lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable and makes appropriate adjustments in the carrying value. No write-downs due to impairment have been required to date based upon the Company's impairment assessments.

Foreign Currency Translation
-
The functional currency of the foreign subsidiary is the reporting currency, which is U.S. dollars.  In accordance with SFAS No. 52, foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the current exchange rates and non monetary assets, liabilities and stockholder's equity are translated at historical rates at each balance sheet date.  Revenues and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates in effect during the year.  The related translation gains and losses are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Foreign Currency Translation,
 
- Income taxes are computed using the liability method in accordance with SFAS No. 109, . Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.  Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets to the extent that they may not be realized.
Income Taxes
Accounting for Income Taxes
 
- On January 1, 2006 the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No.123(Revised), ("SFAS 123(R)")to accountfor stock-based compensation which requires recognition of expense for the fair value of stock-based compensation awards adjusted for awards not expected to vest. The Company elected to use the modified prospective transition method as permitted by SFAS 123(R). Under this transition method, stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No.123, . Stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted subsequent to January 1, 2006 was based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R). The Company recognizes compensation expense for stock options granted subsequent to January 1, 2006 on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award.
Stock-Based Compensation
Share Based Payment
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
 
- The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured consistent with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, .  This generally occurs upon shipment of the Company's products.  The Company does not provide its customers with a general right of product return. However, the Company will accept returns of products that are deemed to be damaged or defective when delivered. Product returns have generally not been significant. No provision was made for returns in 2007.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements
 
All revenues are reported net of sales taxes in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations.
 
Shipping and Handling Costs
- Shipping and handling costs billed to customers for product shipments are recorded in "net sales" and the related cost is included in "cost of sales" in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Revenues from shipping and handling totaled $306,986 in 2007.
 
- Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.  Advertising expenses were $144,203 for the year ended December, 31 2007.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
- Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period, resulting from transactions and other events and circumstances from nonowner sources.  The Company to date has not reported on its financial statements any comprehensive income items.
Comprehensive Income
 
- In July 2006, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 48, (FIN 48), which is a change in accounting for income taxes. FIN 48 specifies how tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are to be recognized, measured, and derecognized in financial statements; requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters; specifies how reserves for uncertain tax positions should be classified on the balance sheet; and provides transition and interim-period guidance, among other provisions. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and as a result, for the Company is effective on January 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of FIN 48 on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109
 
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, ("SFAS 157"). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework and gives guidance regarding the methods used in measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is applicable whenever another accounting pronouncement requires or permits assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value. SFAS 157 does not expand or require any new fair value measures, however the application of this statement may change current practice. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and as a result, is effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157 on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
Fair Value Measurements
 
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, ("SFAS 159").  This statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.  The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis, with few exceptions. SFAS 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirement to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar assets and liabilities.  SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007.  While the Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 159, it is not expected that it will have a material effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-Including an Amendment of FASB statement No. 115
 
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), ("SFAS 141R").  This statement changes the accounting for acquisition transaction costs by requiring them to be expensed in the period incurred, and also changes the accounting for contingent consideration, acquired contingencies and restructuring costs related to an acquisition.  SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008.  The effect that adoption of SFAS 141R will have on the Company's financial statements will depend on the nature and size of acquisitions that are completed after the Company adopts SFAS 141R.In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, ("SFAS 160").  This statement will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity.  SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008.  The effect that adoption of SFAS 160 will have on the Company's financial statements will depend on the nature and size of acquisitions the Company completes after it adopts SFAS 160.

Going Concern
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Although the Company's revenue has grown each year for the past five years, it has sustained recurring operating losses and is partially dependent upon proceeds from additional financing to fund its operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company plans to finance its operations through a combination of additional financing through the sale of equity securities and improved operating cash flows based upon implementation of cost controls combined with  revenue growth, however there is no guarantee that management will be able to implement any or all of these measures. The financial statements do not include any adjustments related to this uncertainty. Currently, the Company is in the process of attempting to raise equity funding totaling approximately $7 to $8.5 million.

Acquisition
 
Acquisition of Panomics
 
On February 8, 2006 the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of a privately held California corporation, Panomics, Inc., which was a major provider of life sciences research reagents for transcription regulation, cell signaling and signal transduction.  The transaction was accounted for as a purchase business combination.  Following the transaction the Company changed its name to Panomics, Inc. The aggregate purchase price was approximately $6.3 million, which was comprised of $1.9 million in cash, 6,813,550 shares common and 7,105,762 of our preferred stock valued at $4.2 million and approximately $0.1 million in associated transaction costs. The table below summarizes the total purchase price for the acquisition:
 
Panomics, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
 
The total purchase price has been allocated to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows:
 
 
The primary reason for acquisition was that the products of Panomics were complementary to the Company's products, which would help to boost the revenues of the Company and cash flows and also would shorten the time to reach profitability. The excess of purchase consideration over fair value of the assets acquired was recorded as Goodwill. Goodwill recorded in conjunction with the acquisition is not deductible for income tax purposes. Other intangible assets are being amortized as described in Note 5.

Commitments and Contingencies
 
- The Company occupies a facility located in Fremont, California under an operating lease arrangement. The lease provides for a rent escalation each year, and the Company is recognizing the total lease payments on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease which ends May 31, 2009. In connection with this lease, a security deposit was given in the form of an irrevocable standby letter of credit issued by a bank in the amount of $128,293. This standby letter of credit is recorded in long-term restricted cash on the balance sheet. This letter of credit expires on July 30, 2009.

Rent expense under the operating leases amounted to $503,304 for the year ended December 31, 2007.
 
In May 2003, the Company entered into a license agreement with a pharmaceutical company whereby the Company obtained intellectual property rights related to technology for the development, use and sale of certain gene expression product lines worldwide, as well as rights to market certain assay kits in research markets worldwide.
Technology License
-
 
The agreement was entered into to develop certain products and to build customer relationships for the sale of the assay kits, which would only be of value if the development of the intended products was successful.  Under the agreement, the licensor is obligated to supply the Company with the components of the assay kits, and the Company is obligated to pay the licensor a percentage of net revenues received from the sale of products containing the technology.
 
In January 2005 the parties modified the license agreement to reduce the royalty rates, expand the field where the Company may sell the products to include clinical trials, and to modify exclusivity rights. Under the modification agreement, the Company was required to pay the licensor additional license fees of $350,000, $325,000, and $325,000 in January 2005, December 2005 and December 2006 respectively.  During the year ended December 31, 2007 the Company paid a license fee of $100,000 to extend its exclusivity period for one year.  In 2008, the Company expects to pay an additional fee of $300,000 to provide perpetual exclusivity.
 
The license fees related to this agreement (including both the upfront fees and the additional fees) were charged to research and development expense when incurred (upon the due date of such fees) because the technology acquired under the agreement was incomplete and had no alternative future use. There was no value ascribed to marketing rights of the assay kits, as the Company's use of such rights was only to establish customer relationships for their future product line and by itself, the Company does not expect the assay kits to generate profits.
 
In 2006 and 2005 the Company entered into research and development agreements with third parties to fund certain research activities and to obtain exclusive rights to manufacture, use, and sell products using the technology developed. Under the agreements the Company is obligated to pay the licensors license fees, milestone payments, and a percentage of net revenue received from sales of products containing the technologies, subject to minimum royalty payments.  In 2007, the Company paid or accrued the third parties fees in regard to these agreements totaling $332,967, net of reimbursements.  The license fees were charged to research and development expense as incurred, because the technology under the agreements was incomplete and had no alternative future use.  In 2008, the Company is required to pay $171,735 to fund this research.  In 2008, a sublicensor of the technology is obligated to reimburse the Company $100,000 of the fees.
 
- From time to time, the Company may be subject to claims that arise in the normal course of business. Although the amount of any liability with respect to such litigation cannot be determined, in the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.
Contingencies
 
Panomics, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
The Company as permitted under California law and in accordance with its bylaws indemnifies its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences, subject to certain limits, while they were serving at its request in such capacity. The maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited; however, the Company has a director and officer insurance policy that enables the company to recover a portion of any amounts paid. As a result of the insurance policy coverage, the Company believes the fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal.

Loan Payable and Capital Lease Obligation
 
The Company entered into a loan and security agreement (the "Loan Agreement"), on April 26, 2007 with a bank to provide working capital.  Under the terms of the Loan Agreement, the Company has a line of credit of up to $2 million subject to borrowing base limitations and a term loan of up to $4 million.  The borrowing base under line of credit consists generally of 80% of qualified accounts receivable.  The Company has until April 26, 2008 to draw upon the term loan during which time only payments of interest are due monthly.  Commencing May 1, 2008, the outstanding balance of the term loan will be payable in equal monthly installments of principal plus interest to October 31, 2010.  The line of credit matures on March 31, 2009.  Interest on the line of credit and term loan is payable monthly at the prime rate plus 0.75% totaling 8.00% at December 31, 2007.
 
The Loan Agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company.  Loan covenants include minimum year to date revenues and prohibitions against paying any dividends, incurring additional indebtedness, mergers and acquisitions, and material adverse changes in the Company.  As of December 31, 2007 the Company was in full compliance with the covenants.
 
At December 31, 2007 the outstanding balances of the line of credit and term loan were $813,031 and $736,969. At December 31, 2007 $1,186,969 of the line of credit and $3,263,031 of the term loan remained available for use by the Company.  The scheduled maturities of the line of credit and term loan are as follows:

In connection with the loan agreement the Company granted the lender a warrant exercisable for 251,383 shares of Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock with an exercise price of $.5967 per share.  The warrant has a term of 7 years and expires in April 2014.  This warrant was valued using the Black-Scholes Model with the following assumptions:  expected term- the 7 year contractual life of the warrant, volatility- 46.4%, dividend yield- 0%, risk free interest rate- 4.58% and stock price of $.5967 per share.  The resulting fair value of $82,956 was recorded as a discount to the term loan and is being amortized over the life of the term loan using a method that approximates the effective interest method. During 2007 amortization of this discount totaled $17,363 and was recorded as interest expense in the Statement of Operations.
 
Because the warrant is exercisable into Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock which is contingently redeemable, in accordance with the guidance in SFAS 150 (as interpreted by the guidance in FASB Staff Position 150-5 the warrant has been classified and accounted for as a liability instrument at fair value, with changes in fair value being recorded in the Statement of Operations.  Accordingly the Company has classified this instrument as a long-term liability within the caption Warrant Liability in the Balance Sheet.

Panomics, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income, if any, the amount and timing of which are uncertain.  Accordingly, since management is unable to conclude that it is more-likely-than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance.  The net valuation allowance increased by approximately $3,343,000 during the year ended December 31, 2007.
 
As of December 31, 2007, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $57,818,000. The Company also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1,682,000. The federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2020, if not utilized.
 
As of December 31, 2007, the Company had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $56,830,000. The Company also had state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1,747,000. The state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2012, if not utilized. The state tax credits will carryforward indefinitely.
 
Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization.

The Company sells and develops reagent kits and probe sets that quantitatively measure gene expression, transcription regulation, protein interaction, and cell signaling within cells for use in drug discovery and other research and development applications.  The Company's principal market is the life sciences research market consisting of drug development companies, government research centers, and universities located mainly in the United States and Europe.  The Company's primary facilities are located in Fremont, California. The Company also has a sales subsidiary located in Italy. The Company's revenues, by geographical area, consisted of the following:
Description of the Company and Business
 
 
 The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") for interim consolidated financial statements.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting principally of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ended 2008.
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the wholly-owned subsidiary, Panomics SRL, located in Italy. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company's most significant estimates relate to valuation and impairment determinations of goodwill and intangible assets, inventory valuation, and the value of the Company's common stock and Series Z preferred stock as a private company and related values assigned to share-based payments. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Use of Estimates
 
- Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include, but are not limited to royalties, payroll and personnel expenses, laboratory supplies, and consulting costs.
Research and Development

- The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity from the date of purchase of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of bank demand deposits, time deposits, money market funds, and government and corporate bonds. Time deposits with maturities ranging from over 90 days to a year are classified in the balance sheet as time deposits.
Cash and Cash Equivalents and Time Deposits
 
At September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, the Company had restricted cash of $159,271 and $223,782 respectively, required to be maintained on deposit for the Company's leased facilities, sales tax payments, escrow account relating to the Panomics merger and a credit card arrangement.
 
- The Company's concentration of credit risk consists principally of cash and cash equivalents and time deposits. The Company's investment policy restricts investments to high quality investments and limits the amounts invested with any one issuer. The Company believes that it has established guidelines for investment of its excess cash that maintain safety and liquidity through its policies on diversification and investment maturity.
Concentration of Credit Risk
 
The Company is also subject to credit risk from its accounts receivable related to product sales. To date, the Company has not experienced losses with respect to the collection of its accounts receivable and believe that all its accounts receivable as reflected in the balance sheet are collectible.
 
During the nine months ended September 30, 2008, 14% of revenue recognized was from the Company's top three customers compared to 18% of revenue recognized from the top three customers for the same period in 2007.  No customer contributed more than 7% of sales in either period.  At September 30, 2008, approximately 14% of the trade receivables outstanding were from three customers, who individually made up the following composition of total accounts receivable: 5%, 5%, and 4%, compared to September 30, 2007 when 23% of the trade receivables outstanding were from three customers, who individually made up 9%, 8%, and 6%.
 
Inventories
- Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first-out method), or market. When necessary, provision is made for obsolete, excess and slow-moving inventory.
 
- Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which are three to five years for computer equipment and software and three to seven years for laboratory and office equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the period of lease term or the estimated useful lives of the related assets, whichever is shorter.
Property and Equipment
 
- Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration paid over the value assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Panomics acquisition during 2006. The Company accounts for its goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, , which requires the Company to test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. To date, based upon the Company's impairment test, no adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill have been required.

Long-lived Assets
- Purchased technology and other identifiable intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. The Company amortizes identifiable intangible assets using methods that reflect their pattern of usage or benefit to the company over their estimated useful lives. The range of estimated useful lives of the Company's identifiable intangibles is one to ten years. Acquired in-process technology is expensed during the period of acquisition.
 
The Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS No. 144, . Under this standard, the Company reviews long-lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable and makes appropriate adjustments in the carrying value. No write-downs due to impairment have been required to date based upon the Company's impairment assessments.
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
 
Foreign Currency Translation
-
The functional currency of the foreign subsidiary is the reporting currency, which is U.S. dollars.  In accordance with SFAS No. 52, foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the current exchange rates and non monetary assets, liabilities and stockholder's equity are translated at historical rates at each balance sheet date.  Revenues and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates in effect during the year.  The related translation gains and losses are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

- Income taxes are computed using the liability method in accordance with SFAS No. 109, . Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.  Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets to the extent that they may not be realized.

- On January 1, 2006 the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No.123(Revised), ("SFAS 123(R)")to accountfor stock-based compensation which requires recognition of expense for the fair value of stock-based compensation awards adjusted for awards not expected to vest. The Company elected to use the modified prospective transition method as permitted by SFAS 123(R). Under this transition method, stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 included compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No.123, . Stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted subsequent to January 1, 2006 is based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R). The Company recognizes compensation expense for stock options granted subsequent to January 1, 2006 on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award.

- The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured consistent with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, .  This generally occurs upon shipment of the Company's products.  The Company does not provide its customers with a general right of product return. However, the Company will accept returns of products that are deemed to be damaged or defective when delivered. Product returns have generally not been significant. No provision was made for returns in 2008 and 2007.

All revenues are reported net of sales taxes in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.
 
Shipping and Handling Costs
- Shipping and handling costs billed to customers for product shipments are recorded in "net sales" and the related cost is included in "cost of sales" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Revenues from shipping and handling costs totaled $281,171 and $233,497 for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

- Certain items from the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation and had no effect on previously reported net loss or accumulated deficit.
Reclassifications
 
- In July 2006, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 48, ("FIN 48"), which is a change in accounting for income taxes. FIN 48 specifies how tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are to be recognized, measured, and derecognized in financial statements; requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters; specifies how reserves for uncertain tax positions should be classified in the balance sheet; and provides transition and interim-period guidance, among other provisions. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and as a result, for the Company is effective on January 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of FIN 48 on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, ("SFAS 159").  This statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.  The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis, with few exceptions. SFAS 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar assets and liabilities.  SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Adoption of SFAS 159 did not have a material impact on the Company.
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115
 
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), ("SFAS 141R").  This statement changes the accounting for acquisition transaction costs by requiring them to be expensed in the period incurred, and also changes the accounting for contingent consideration, acquired contingencies and restructuring costs related to an acquisition.  SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008.  The effect that adoption of SFAS 141R will have on the Company's financial statements will depend on the nature and size of acquisitions that are completed after the Company adopts SFAS 141R.
Business Combinations
 
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, ("SFAS 160").  This statement will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity.  SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008.  The effect that adoption of SFAS 160 will have on the Company's financial statements will depend on the nature and size of acquisitions the Company completes after it adopts SFAS 160.

and its related interpretations, and the effect of derivative instruments and related hedged items on financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161 also requires the disclosure of the fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format. SFAS 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early adoption encouraged. This Statement is not expected to have a material impact on the Company.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS 142-3, This guidance is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS 141R when the underlying arrangement includes renewal or extension of terms that would require substantial costs or result in a material modification to the asset upon renewal or extension. Companies estimating the useful life of a recognized intangible asset must now consider their historical experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements or, in the

This FSP shall be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of FSP 142-3 on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

- The Company occupies a facility located in Fremont, California under an operating lease arrangement. The lease provides for a rent escalation each year, and the Company is recognizing the total lease payments on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Effective August, 15 2008 the lease was amended to end July 31, 2011, and monthly payments were reduced.  In connection with this lease, a security deposit was given in the form of an irrevocable standby letter of credit issued by a bank which was reduced by the amendment to the amount of $109,216. This standby letter of credit is recorded in long-term restricted cash in the balance sheet. This letter of credit expires on September 30, 2011.

Rent expense under the operating leases amounted to $371,298 and $377,478 for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007 respectively.
 
In May 2003, the Company entered into a license agreement with a pharmaceutical company whereby the Company obtained intellectual property rights to technology for the development, use and sale of gene expression product lines worldwide, and to market certain assay kits to the research market.  The agreement was entered into to develop products and to build customer relationships for the future sale of the developed gene expression products.  Under the agreement the licensor is obligated to supply the Company with the components of the assay kits, and the Company is obligated to pay the licensor a percentage of net revenues received from the sale of products containing the technology.  In January 2005 the parties modified the license agreement to reduce the royalty rates, expand the field where the Company may sell the products to include clinical trials, and modify exclusivity rights. During the year ended December 31, 2007 the Company paid a license fee of $100,000 to extend its exclusivity period for one year.  In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company paid an additional fee of $300,000 to provide perpetual exclusivity. The license fees related to this agreement were charged to research and development expense when incurred (upon the due date of such fees) because the technology acquired under the agreement was incomplete and had no alternative future use.  There was no value ascribed to the assay kit marketing rights as the use of such rights was only to establish customer relationships for their future product line and assay kit sales are not expected to generate profits.
Technology Licenses
-
 
In 2006 and 2005 the Company entered into research and development agreements with third parties to fund certain research activities and to obtain exclusive rights to manufacture, use, and sell products using the technology developed. Under the agreements the Company is obligated to pay the licensors license fees, milestone payments, and a percentage of net revenue received from sales of products containing the technologies, subject to minimum royalty payments.  For the period ending September 30, 2008 and September 30, 2007, the Company paid or accrued the third parties fees in regard to these agreements totaling $336,391 and $154,657, respectively, net of reimbursements.  The company received reimbursements of $75,000 for each of the same

periods.  The license fees were charged to research and development expense as incurred, because the technology under the agreements was incomplete and had no alternative future use.  In the fourth quarter of 2008 and 2007, the Company was required to pay $51,196 and $96,577, respectively, to fund this research.  During the fourth quarter of 2008 and 2007, a sublicensor of the technology was obligated to reimburse the Company $25,000 of the fee.
 
- From time to time, the Company may be subject to claims that arise in the normal course of business. Although the amount of any liability with respect to such litigation cannot be determined, in the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these claims is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.
Contingencies
 
The Company, as permitted under California law and in accordance with its bylaws, indemnifies its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences, subject to certain limits, while they were serving at its request in such capacity. The maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited; however, the Company has a director and officer insurance policy that enables the Company to recover a portion of any amounts paid. As a result of the insurance policy coverage, the Company believes the fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal.

Loan Payable and Capital Lease Obligation
 
The Company entered into a loan and security agreement (the "Loan Agreement"), on April 26, 2007 with a bank to provide working capital.  Under the terms of the Loan Agreement, the Company has a line of credit of up to $2 million subject to borrowing base limitations and a term loan of up to $4 million.  The borrowing base under line of credit consists generally of 80% of qualified accounts receivable.  The Company had until April 26, 2008 to draw upon the term loan during which time only payments of interest were due monthly.  Effective August 15, 2008 the loan agreement was amended to extend the maturity date to April 30, 2011 and change the interest rate to prime rate plus 1.0%.  Commencing May 1, 2008, the outstanding balance of the term loan was payable in equal monthly installments of principal plus interest through April 30, 2011.  The line of credit matures on March 31, 2009.  Interest on the line of credit and term loan is payable monthly at the prime rate plus 1.0% totaling 6.00% at September, 30 2008.
 
The Loan Agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company.  Loan covenants include minimum year to date revenues and prohibitions against paying any dividends, incurring additional indebtedness, mergers and acquisitions, and material adverse changes in the Company.  As of September 30, 2008, the Company was in full compliance with the covenants.  In connection with the subsequent sale of the Company, this loan was repaid in full (see Note 1).
 
At September 30, 2008, the outstanding balances of the line of credit and term loan were $0 and $3,381,818, respectively. At September 30, 2008 all of the line of credit and none of the term loan remained available for use by the Company.  The scheduled maturities of the term loan are as follows:

In connection with the loan agreement the Company granted the lender a warrant exercisable for 251,383 shares of Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock with an exercise price of $.5967 per share.  The warrant has a term of 7 years and expires in April 2014.  This warrant was valued using the Black-Scholes Model with the following assumptions:  expected term- 7 year contractual life of the warrant, volatility- 46.4%, dividend yield- 0%, risk free interest rate- 4.58% and stock price of $.5967 per share.  The resulting fair value of $82,956 was recorded as a discount to the term loan and is being amortized over the life of the term loan using a method that approximates the effective interest method. During 2007 amortization of this discount totaled $17,363 and was recorded as interest expense in the Statement of Operations.
 
Because the warrant is exercisable into Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock which is contingently redeemable, in accordance with the guidance in SFAS 150 (as interpreted by the guidance in FASB Staff Position 150-5 the warrant has been classified and accounted for as a liability instrument at fair value, with changes in fair value being recorded in the Statement of Operations.  To date, changes in fair value of this warrant have been negligible. Accordingly the Company has classified this instrument as a long-term liability within the caption Warrant Liability in the Balance Sheet.

Preparation of the unaudited pro forma financial information for all periods presented required management to make certain judgments and estimates to determine the pro forma adjustments such as purchase accounting adjustments, which include, among others, fair value of inventory and fixed assets acquired and amortization charges from acquired intangible assets.
 
This unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and accompanying notes of Panomics (contained elsewhere in this Form 8-K/A), and Affymetrix's historical financial statements and accompanying notes appearing in its historical periodic SEC filings including Forms 10-K and 10-Q.
 
 
1.   BASIS OF PRO FORMA PRESENTATION
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data were prepared using the purchase method of accounting and was based on the historical financial statements of Affymetrix, Inc. ("Affymetrix") and Panomics, Inc. ("Panomics") after giving effect to Affymetrix's acquisition of Panomics on December 5, 2008. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2008 combines the historical Affymetrix and Panomics balance sheets as if the acquisition had closed on September 30, 2008. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 and the nine months ended September 30, 2008 combine the historical Affymetrix and Panomics statements of operations as if the acquisition had closed on January 1, 2007.
 
We account for business combinations pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 141, ("SFAS 141"). In accordance with SFAS 141, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired company to the net tangible assets and intangible assets, as well as to in-process research and development, acquired based upon their estimated fair values. We have made assumptions and estimates in determining the estimated purchase price and the allocation of the estimated purchase price in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. These estimates and assumptions are subject to change during the purchase price allocation period (generally one year from the acquisition date) as we finalize the valuations of the net tangible assets, intangible assets and in-process research and development acquired. In particular, the final valuations of identifiable intangible assets, property values and associated tax effects may change significantly from our estimates. These changes could result in material variances between our future financial results and the amounts presented in these unaudited condensed combined financial statements, including variances in fair values recorded, as well as expenses and cash flows associated with these items.
Business Combinations
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not reflect any cost savings and/or operating efficiencies that we may achieve with respect to the combined companies.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are presented for informational purposes only and are not intended to represent or be indicative of the results of the consolidated results of operations or financial position that would have been reported had the Panomics acquisition occurred as of the dates presented, and should not be taken as representative of our future consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Preparation of the unaudited pro forma financial information for all periods presented required management to make certain judgments and estimates to determine the pro forma adjustments such as purchase accounting adjustments, which include, among others, fair value of inventory and fixed assets acquired and amortization charges from acquired intangible assets.
 
2.   PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION
 
On December 5, 2008, Affymetrix completed the acquisition of Panomics for cash consideration of approximately $72.7 million, including transaction costs of approximately $0.9 million. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
 
The purchase consideration was allocated based on the estimated fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Panomics. An allocation of the purchase price was made to major categories of assets and liabilities in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements based on management's best estimates, assuming the acquisition of Panomics had closed on September 30, 2008, using the fair value estimates from December 5, 2008. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill.
 
Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation
 
The allocation of the purchase price in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2008 was prepared based on the results of a valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the December 5, 2008 closing date, as presented below (in thousands):
 
Intangible Assets
 
In performing our preliminary purchase price allocation, we considered, among other factors, our intention for future use of acquired assets, analyses of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of Panomics' products. The fair values of intangible assets were calculated primarily using an income approach and estimates and assumptions provided by both Panomics and Affymetrix management. The rates utilized to discount net cash flows to their present values were based on a range of discount rates of 14% to 16% applied to the intangible assets to reflect the risk of the asset revenues derived from the respective intangible asset. The following table sets forth the preliminary components of intangible assets associated with the Panomics acquisition (in thousands, except useful life):
 
 
Customer contracts and related support relationships represent the underlying relationships and agreements with Panomics' customers. Existing technology is comprised of products that have reached technological feasibility and are a part of Panomics' product lines. Patents/core technology represents a series of awarded patents, filed patent applications and core architectures that are used in Panomics' products and forms a major part of the architecture of both current and planned future product releases. Services and related relationships relates to the cash flows generated from existing Panomics' service agreements in place.
 
In-Process Research and Development
 
We expense in-process research and development ("IPR&D") upon acquisition as it represents incomplete Panomics' research and development projects. The acquired IPR&D is at a stage of development that requires further research and development to determine technical feasibility and commercial viability. Technological feasibility is established when an enterprise has completed all planning, designing, coding, and testing activities that are necessary to establish that a product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions, features, and technical performance requirements. The value assigned to IPR&D of $0.3 million was determined by considering the importance of each project to our overall development plan, estimating costs to develop the purchased IPR&D into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows to their present values based on the percentage of completion of the IPR&D projects. We recorded the IPR&D expense in the quarter ended December 31, 2008.
3.   PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS
 
The following pro forma adjustments are included in our unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements:
 
To record cash paid for Panomics common stock.
(A)
                             
 
To accrue for estimated acquisition-related transaction costs.
(B)
                               
 
To record the difference between the historical amounts of Panomics intangible assets, net and preliminary fair values of Panomics intangible assets acquired and associated amortization expense (in thousands):
(C)
          
 
 
 
 
To eliminate Panomics historical goodwill and record the preliminary estimate of goodwill for the acquisition of Panomics (in thousands):
(D)
                              
 
 
To eliminate transactions between Affymetrix and Panomics for historical periods presented.
(E)
                                
 
To record the following adjustments to stockholders' equity (in thousands):
(F)
                                
 
 
To record the difference between the historical amounts of Panomics' property and equipment, net and estimated fair values of the property acquired.
(G)
          
 
To record the difference between the historical amounts of Panomics' inventory and estimated fair values of the inventory acquired as well as to conform to Affymetrix's reserve methodology.
(H)
         
 
To record the amortization of inventory step-up.
(I)
                                   
 
To eliminate the previously recorded investment in Panomics.
(J)
                                  
To record pro forma tax impact at the average estimated rates applicable to the jurisdictions in which the income (loss) was incurred.
(K)
         
 
4.   PRO FORMA EARNINGS PER SHARE
 
The pro forma basic and diluted earnings per share amounts presented in our unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations are based upon the weighted average number of our common shares outstanding and are adjusted for additional stock awards issued as new hire awards to the Panomics employees who joined Affymetrix on an actual outstanding basis as if those awards had been issued at the acquisition date as of the beginning of each period presented without consideration for any subsequent award activity such as exercises and cancellations. We did not apply the treasury stock method for the Panomics stock awards as the impact was immaterial to our weighted average common shares outstanding.  Our acquisition of Panomics had no impact to our basic weighted average common shares outstanding calculations for the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations periods presented.

Quarterly Highlights
 
RNA Analysis
 
Affymetrix and Genisphere announced the launch of a new, best-in-class solution for microRNA (miRNA) research studies.  This product provides comprehensive miRNA coverage for 71 organisms on a single array.  The species covered include human, mouse, rat, canine, and monkey, all of which are critical models for pharmaceutical and academic scientists working in oncology, stem cell research, toxicology, neuroscience, infectious disease, and many other areas.
 
miRNAs are emerging as a major component in the regulation of gene expression.  Their main function is to down-regulate expression by binding to and modulating the translation of specific mRNAs. This product allows researchers to compare expression profiles across tissues and cell samples to gain insight into the role that miRNAs play in various biological processes, such as development, differentiation, viral infection, apoptosis, and oncogenesis.
 
DNA Analysis
 
The company announced the launch of its next-generation series of products for cytogenetics. This entirely new solution includes arrays, reagents, software, and enables fast and reliable detection of known and novel chromosome aberrations.  The new Affymetrix Cytogenetics Assay has been simplified to eliminate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) steps in order to save customers time and money, reduce operator error, and deliver reliable results with only three hours of hands-on time. Customers can choose between a whole-genome and a focused array so they have the flexibility to select the content and price point that best match their needs.

Item 8.01 Other Events
On May 4, 2009, we were named as a defendant in a complaint filed by plaintiff Illumina, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin.  In the complaint, plaintiff alleges that we are infringing U.S. Patent No. 7,510,841 by making and selling certain of our GeneChip products.  Plaintiff seeks a permanent injunction enjoining us from further infringement and unspecified monetary damages.  We believe that plaintiffs claims are without merit and will vigorously defend against them.

In re Affymetrix Derivative Litigation,
Horwich v. Fodor,
The Federal Action and the State Action (collectively, the Actions) each allege or alleged claims on behalf of Affymetrix against certain current and former officers and directors of Affymetrix, arising from or relating to the alleged improper granting of stock options at Affymetrix.
On April 2, 2007, Federal Plaintiffs filed the Verified Amended Consolidated Shareholder Derivative Complaint (Amended Complaint) in the Federal Action alleging on behalf of nominal party Affymetrix that Stephen P.A. Fodor, Ph.D., Paul Berg, John A. Young, John D. Diekman,

Vernon R. Loucks, Jr., David B. Singer, Kenneth J. Nussbacher, Richard P. Rava, Gregory T. Schiffman, Susan E. Siegel, Edward M. Hurwitz, Vernon A. Norviel and Ronald D. Verdoorn (collectively, the "Federal Defendants") breached their fiduciary obligations by engaging in improper stock option backdating. On May 21, 2007, the Federal Defendants filed motions to dismiss the Amended Complaint. Thereafter, on March 31, 2008, the Federal Court granted in part, and denied in part, the Federal Defendants' motions to dismiss.
On April 18, 2008, Federal Plaintiffs filed the Verified Second Amended Consolidated Shareholder Derivative Complaint ("Second Amended Complaint"). On May 15, 2008, the Federal Defendants filed motions to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint. Thereafter, on October 24, 2008, the Federal Court granted in part, and denied in part, the Federal Defendants' motions to dismiss. Federal Plaintiffs thereafter designated the Second Amended Complaint as the operative complaint and subsequently, the Federal Defendants filed answers to the Second Amended Complaint on December 3, 2008 and December 4, 2008. Thereafter, the parties exchanged certain information regarding the claims in the Actions.
On November 5, 2008, independent members of the Board of Directors, resolved to create a Special Litigation Committee to consider Affymetrix's historical stock option practices, including without limitation the matters asserted in the Actions. The members of the outside Board of Directors delegated to the SLC full authority and power to control and determine Affymetrix's response to the Actions and the claims asserted therein. Independent directors Robert P. Wayman, Susan D. Desmond-Hellmann, M.D., and Robert H. Trice, Ph.D. were appointed as the SLC members. Each of the SLC members is an independent, non-executive director and none of the SLC members is a defendant in the Federal Action.
On December 19, 2008, certain parties, including counsel for the Federal Plaintiffs, the State Plaintiff, the Individual Defendants, Affymetrix and the SLC, conducted an all day mediation session before Mediator Antonio Piazza. At the conclusion of the mediation, the parties executed a written agreement-in-principle to settle the Actions. Since the mediation, counsel for the Federal Plaintiffs, the State Plaintiff, the Defendants and the SLC have continued settlement negotiations to resolve the Actions on the terms set forth herein.

II. CLAIMS OF THE PLAINTIFFS AND BENEFITS OF SETTLEMENT
Plaintiffs (defined below in 1.15) believe that the claims they have asserted in the Actions on behalf of Affymetrix have merit. However, counsel for the Plaintiffs recognize and acknowledge the expense and length of continued proceedings necessary to prosecute the Actions against Defendants through trial and through appeals. Plaintiffs' Counsel (as defined in 1.16) have also taken into account the uncertain outcome and the risk of any litigation, especially in complex actions such as the Actions, as well as the difficulties and delays inherent in such litigation. Counsel for the Plaintiffs are also mindful of the inherent problems of proof and possible defenses to the claims asserted in the Actions or which may be asserted. Based on their evaluation, Plaintiffs and their counsel have determined that the settlement set forth in the Stipulation is in the best interests of the Plaintiffs, Affymetrix and its shareholders. Counsel for the Plaintiffs believe that the settlement set forth in the Stipulation confers substantial benefits upon Affymetrix and its shareholders.
III. DEFENDANTS' DENIALS OF WRONGDOING AND LIABILITY
Defendants (defined below in 1.3) have denied and continue to deny each and all of the claims and contentions alleged by the Plaintiffs in the Actions. Defendants expressly have denied and continue to deny all charges of wrongdoing or liability against them arising out of any of the conduct, statements, acts or omissions alleged, or that could have been alleged, in the Actions. Defendants also have denied and continue to deny, the allegations that the Plaintiffs, Affymetrix or its shareholders have suffered damage, or that the Plaintiffs, Affymetrix or its shareholders were harmed by the conduct alleged in the Actions. The Individual Defendants have further asserted that at all relevant times, they acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in the best interests of Affymetrix and its shareholders.
inter alia,
Nonetheless, Defendants and the SLC, on behalf of Affymetrix, have also taken into account the uncertainty and risks inherent in any litigation, especially in complex cases like the Actions. Defendants and the SLC have, therefore, determined that it is desirable and beneficial that the Actions, and all of the Settling Parties' disputes related thereto, be fully and finally settled in the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Stipulation. The SLC, on behalf of

Affymetrix believes that the settlement set forth in this Stipulation confers substantial benefits upon Affymetrix and its shareholders, and is in the best interests of Affymetrix and its shareholders.

On May 14, 2010, the Board of Directors of Affymetrix, Inc. (the Company), upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee, adopted an executive severance policy that offers severance benefits to certain senior executives of the Company, including our named executive officers, if an eligible officer is involuntarily terminated without cause and signs a general release of claims.  Under the policy, the Chief Executive Officer is eligible for severance pay of 24 months of base salary and each of the other named executive officers is eligible for 12 months of base salary.  In addition, each named executive officer is eligible for 12 months of COBRA premiums reimbursement if he timely elects COBRA coverage.  The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by a copy of the executive severan ce policy that is filed as Exhibit 10.43 to this Form 8-K.
In addition, the Board of Directors approved changes to the Companys existing change in control policy.  This policy, which is applicable to all employees, would be implemented if the Company is the subject of a change in control.  The policy is intended to provide severance benefits for employees who are terminated, or whose jobs are materially adversely affected, as a result of a change in control.  In the event of a change of control, this policy supersedes the severance policy, so there is no duplication of benefits.  The policy now includes an employees target bonus in the severance calculation, and this change is applicable to all employees, including our named executive officers.  As a result, each of our named executive officers will receive 24 months of base salary plus 200% of his annual target bonus in the event that he is terminated as a result of a change in control.  The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by a copy of the change of control policy that is filed as Exhibit 10.29 to this Form 8-K.

Affymetrix, Inc. (Nasdaq: AFFX) today reported that based on preliminary financial data, the Company expects total revenue for the second quarter of 2010 to be in the range of $71-72 million, as compared to the Companys previous guidance in the range of $80-82 million. The company expects product revenue for the second quarter of 2010 to be approximately $65-66 million, including instrument sales of approximately $4-5 million and consumable sales of approximately $60-61 million.
Santa Clara, Calif., July 7, 2010 -
   
The primary factors that contributed to the lower than expected second quarter revenue include:
When the Company previously issued guidance for the second quarter of 2010, we anticipated that growth in product sales would offset an expected decline in services revenue as compared to the second quarter of 2009, stated Kevin M. King, president and CEO. However, instrument adoption was slower than anticipated, principally due to reduced foreign academic research spending. In Europe, we believe our business was impacted by governmental actions taken to address high levels of debt and weakening currencies.
Despite the challenges we experienced in the second quarter, we are confident our business is moving in the right direction and we are focused on growing the business beyond the basic research market, continued King.
Tim Barabe, executive vice president and CFO, said, We continue to make good progress in reducing our operating expenses and we expect to be cash-flow positive on an operating basis in each quarter of fiscal year 2010.  In addition, we have a strong balance sheet and expect to report about $100 million in net cash as of June 30, 2010.
The Company noted that it will not be providing updated revenue guidance for the remainder of 2010 due to uncertainty regarding academic research funding and foreign currency fluctuations.
The Company will provide further information when it reports second quarter 2010 results after the close of the market on Wednesday, July 21, 2010. Affymetrixs management team will host a conference call on July 21, 2010 at 2:00 p.m. PT.

- Company repurchased $96 million of 3.5% convertible notes; Operating expenses down 12% from 2009 -
 
Affymetrix, Inc., (NASDAQ: AFFX) today reported its operating results for the second quarter of 2010. Total revenue for the quarter was $71.7 million, in line with previously announced expectations, as compared to total revenue of $81.6 million in the second quarter of 2009.
Santa Clara, Calif.
July 21, 2010
For the second quarter of 2010, product revenue was $65.1 million, service revenue was $4.7 million, and royalties and other revenue were $1.9 million. This compares to second quarter 2009 product revenue of $67.2 million, service revenue of $12.2 million, and royalties and other revenue of $2.2 million.
The Company reported a net loss of approximately $5.5 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2010, which includes a $1.7 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, gain on debt repurchase from the convertible notes buyback of $26.7 million of aggregate principal amount.  This compares to a net income of $7.3 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2009, which included a $17.4 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, gain on debt repurchase from the convertible notes buyback.
For the second quarter of 2010, cost of product sales was $27.5 million compared to $29.9 million in the same period of 2009, which included $4.6 million of manufacturing consolidation-related costs. Cost of services and other was $3.6 million compared to $7.6 million in the same period of 2009.
Product gross margin was 57.7 percent, as compared to 55.5 percent in the same period of 2009.
For the second quarter of 2010, operating expenses were $46.2 million as compared to operating expenses of $52.3 million in the second quarter of 2009.
Despite the market and commercial challenges that impacted our second quarter results, we continued to make significant operational improvements, including expanding product gross margins and reducing our operating expenses by 12% year-over-year, stated Kevin M. King, president and CEO. We remain confident and are committed to our strategy of expanding the business in the large and growing validation and routine testing markets.
Since the beginning of the second quarter, we have bought back approximately $96 million of our 3.5% convertible notes, strengthening our balance sheet and significantly reducing future interest payments, said Tim Barabe, executive vice president and CFO. Our balance sheet remains strong, with approximately $120 million in net cash, and we continue to be cash-flow positive from operations.
Since the beginning of the second quarter, the Company repurchased a total of $95.8 million of its 3.5% convertible notes maturing in January 2013 for $88.9 million.  During the second quarter, the Company repurchased $26.7 million of notes at face value for $24.6 million, and since June 30, 2010, it repurchased an additional $69.1 million face value of notes for $64.3 million.

Cooperation with Information Requests by the Company
 
8.
 
.  In the event that you breach any of your obligations under this Agreement or as otherwise imposed by law, the Company will be entitled to immediate return of any and all benefits paid to you under this Agreement and to obtain injunctive relief and all other relief provided by law or equity.

This arbitration remedy will be exclusive.  To invoke the arbitration remedy, the complaining party must give notice in writing to the other party and to the American Arbitration Association of his or its intention to arbitrate within the statute of limitations applicable to the controversy and must first submit the matter to a non-binding mediation before a mediator agreed upon by the parties.  The arbitrator will have the authority to grant the same remedies that could be awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction.  The arbitrator will issue findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting the award.  Any arbitration will be held in Santa Clara, California.
Arbitration
 
10.

Except as set forth in this Agreement, there are no representations, promises, agreements or understandings between you and the Company about or pertaining to the separation of your employment with the Company, or the Companys obligations to you with respect to your employment, the termination of your employment or any other matter mentioned above.  This Separation Agreement therefore supersedes any prior written or oral representations, promises, agreements and understandings regarding any the subject matter of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein supersedes or modifies the Indemnification Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement.
Integrated Agreement
 
11.
 
.  This Agreement will in all respects be interpreted and governed under the laws of the State of California.
Governing Law
 
12.

Once signed, please send the Agreement to the attention of John F. Runkel, Jr., General Counsel, at the Company.  The date of your signature will constitute the effective date of this Agreement.  This Agreement may be signed in counterparts, which together shall constitute one agreement.

This involved restructuring the organization to better align our resources with our key commercial opportunities. We reduced our headcount in R&D and plan to reallocate some of those resources to sales and marketing to help drive product adoption. During the quarter, our cash-flow from operations was roughly $12 million and our net cash position increased to approximately $170 million.

Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On November 29, 2011, Affymetrix, Inc. (Affymetrix), Excalibur Acquisition Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Affymetrix (Merger Subsidiary), eBioscience Holding Company, Inc. (eBioscience), and a representative of the securityholders of eBioscience (the Securityholders Representative) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement), pursuant to which Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into eBioscience (the Merger), with eBioscience surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Affymetrix. Affymetrix will pay approximately $330 million in cash to acquire eBioscience, subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Merger Agreement, based upon the amount of eBiosciences transaction expenses and its net cash and net working capital at the closing of the Merger. A portion of the purchase price will be placed in escrow and will be paid to Affymetrix or eBioscience securityholders based on any claims for indemnification by Affymetrix during the escrow period.
 
eBiosciences board of directors has unanimously approved the Merger Agreement. In addition, holders of a majority of eBiosciences common stock have approved the Merger Agreement. The Merger is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2011, and is subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions, including Affymetrixs receipt of debt financing for the Merger.
 
In connection with the foregoing, Affymetrix entered into a commitment letter (the Commitment Letter) with General Electric Capital Corporation, Silicon Valley Bank, CIT Bank and CIT Healthcare LLC (collectively, the Lenders), as well as certain securities affiliates of the Lenders, pursuant to which the Lenders have committed to provide senior secured credit facilities to Affymetrix as the borrower in an aggregate amount of $190 million, comprised of (i) $170 million under a five-year term loan facility (the Term Loan) and (ii) $20 million under a five-year revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility and, together with the Term Loan, the Credit Facilities). The Credit Facilities will be used to finance a portion of the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement, repay eBiosciences existing credit facilities, pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing and with the Credit Facilities and, in the case of any loans under the Revolving Credit Facility made after the closing date of the Merger, for working capital and general corporate purposes.
 
The Lenders commitment to provide the Credit Facilities is subject to several conditions including, without limitation, (i) the nonoccurrence of a material adverse effect on Affymetrix, eBioscience and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) Affymetrix's satisfaction of specified consolidated senior and total leverage tests, (iii) the completion of definitive documentation mutually acceptable to the Borrower and the Lenders and (iv) other customary closing conditions.

Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger
 
On May 3, 2012, Affymetrix, Inc. (Affymetrix), Excalibur Acquisition Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Affymetrix (Merger Subsidiary), eBioscience Holding Company, Inc. (eBioscience), and a representative of the securityholders of eBioscience (the Securityholders Representative) entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement), pursuant to which Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into eBioscience (the Merger), with eBioscience surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Affymetrix. The Merger Agreement amends and restates in its entirety the terms and conditions of that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated November 29, 2011 among the same parties. Affymetrix will pay approximately $315 million in cash to acquire eBioscience, subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Merger Agreement, based upon the amount of eBiosciences transaction expenses and its net cash and net working capital at the closing of the Merger. A portion of the purchase price will be placed in escrow and will be paid to Affymetrix or eBioscience securityholders based on any claims for indemnification by Affymetrix during the escrow period.
 
eBiosciences board of directors has unanimously approved the Merger Agreement. The Merger is expected to close late in the second quarter of 2012, and is subject to customary closing conditions, including Affymetrixs receipt of financing for the Merger. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both eBioscience and Affymetrix, and further provides that upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Affymetrix will pay to eBioscience a termination fee of $15 million. In addition, the Merger Agreement contemplates Affymetrix will fund the transaction with a senior secured financing of $75 million and the proceeds of additional financing expected to be completed by Affymetrix prior to closing.
 
In connection with the foregoing, Affymetrix entered into a commitment letter (the Commitment Letter) with General Electric Capital Corporation and Silicon Valley Bank (collectively, the Lenders), as well as certain securities affiliates of the Lenders, pursuant to which the Lenders have committed to provide senior secured credit facilities to Affymetrix as the borrower in an aggregate amount of $90 million, comprised of (i) $75 million under a five-year term loan facility (the Term Loan) and (ii) $15 million under a five-year revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility and, together with the Term Loan, the Credit Facilities). The Credit Facilities will be used to finance a portion of the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement, repay eBiosciences existing credit facilities, pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing and with the Credit Facilities and, in the case of any loans under the Revolving Credit Facility made after the closing date of the Merger, for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Lenders commitment to provide the Credit Facilities is subject to several conditions including, without limitation, (i) the nonoccurrence of a material adverse effect on Affymetrix, eBioscience and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) Affymetrix's satisfaction of specified consolidated senior and total leverage tests, (iii) the completion of definitive documentation mutually acceptable to Affymetrix and the Lenders, (iv) the receipt by Affymetrix of at least $115 million in gross proceeds from additional financing and (v) other customary closing conditions.
 
This report shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities.

Exhibit 99.1
To the Board of Directors
eBioscience Holding Company, Inc.
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of eBioscience Holding Company, Inc. as of December 31, 2010 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of eBioscience Holding Company, Inc.'s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of eBioscience Holding Company, Inc. as of December 31, 2010 and 2011, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

1. Business Activity and Summary of Accounting Policies and Accounts
Business Activity
eBioscience Holding Company, Inc. is a global leader in the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of research tools in the areas of flow cytometry and immunoassays, which are used to help its customers make scientific discoveries. eBioscience Holding Company, Inc. provides cell analysis reagents (principally antibodies, cytokines and immunological reagents) to academic and government researchers, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies around the world.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of eBioscience Holding Company, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, collectively referred to as "eBioscience" or "the Company." All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Unaudited Interim Financial Statements
The interim consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2012, the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2012, and the statement of stockholders' equity for the three months ended March 31, 2012 are unaudited. The unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements, and in the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring accruals, considered necessary for a fair statement of the results of these interim periods have been included. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2012 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2012.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles, requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements.
 
 
1. Business Activity and Summary of Accounting Policies and Accounts (continued)
 
Foreign Currencies
The Company translates the financial statements of its non-U.S. operations using the end-of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities and the average exchange rates for each reporting period for results of operations. Net gains and losses resulting from the translation of foreign financial statements and the effect of exchange rates on intercompany receivables and payables of a long-term investment nature are recorded as a separate component of stockholders' equity under the caption "Accumulated other comprehensive loss."
Concentrations of Risk
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company limits its exposure to credit loss by placing its cash with high credit quality financial institutions. At times, such deposits may be in excess of insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its cash equivalents.
The Company sells a majority of its products throughout North America, Europe and Asia. The Company makes periodic evaluations of the creditworthiness of its customers and does not require collateral for credit sales.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when the price is fixed and determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of title of the product, which generally occurs upon shipment to the customer. Revenue is not recognized at the time of shipment of products in situations where risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer at a point other than shipment due to the shipping terms, the existence of an acceptance clause, or some return or cancellation privileges. Revenue is recognized once customer acceptance occurs or the acceptance provisions lapse.
Shipping and handling costs are included in costs of sales. Shipping and handling costs charged to customers are recorded as revenue in the period the related product sales revenue is recognized.
 
 
1. Business Activity and Summary of Accounting Policies and Accounts (continued)
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company invests its excess cash mainly in interest bearing money market instruments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. These instruments, stated at cost which approximates market value, are readily convertible into cash and are considered cash equivalents.
Trade Accounts Receivable
The Company provides reserves against trade receivables for estimated losses that may result from customers' inability to pay. The amount is determined by analyzing known uncollectible accounts, aged receivables, economic conditions in the customers' country or industry, historical losses and customer creditworthiness.
Inventories
Inventories are generally stated at lower of cost or market, and determined principally on the standard cost method for manufactured goods, which approximates cost on the first-in, first-out method. The Company reviews the components of its inventories on a regular basis for excess, expired, and obsolete inventory and makes appropriate dispositions as appropriate. Reserves for inventories were $12,268,000, $8,196,000 and $8,356,000 (unaudited) at December 31, 2010 and 2011, and March 31, 2012, respectively.
Inventories include material, labor and overhead costs in addition to purchase accounting adjustments to write-up acquired inventory to estimated selling prices less costs to complete, costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance.
Inventories consist of the following (in thousands) at:
 
 
 
1. Business Activity and Summary of Accounting Policies and Accounts (continued)
 
Equipment and Leasehold Improvements
Equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of equipment is provided using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives which range from three to seven years. Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the respective leases.
Equipment and leasehold improvements consist of the following (in thousands) at:
 
Depreciation and amortization expense related to equipment and leasehold improvements totaled $630,000, $882,000, $1,523,000, $265,000 (unaudited), and $403,000 (unaudited) for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010, and 2011, and for the three month periods ended March 31, 2011 and 2012, respectively.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess purchase price of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations over their estimated fair value. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis as of October 31, and earlier if there is an indicator of impairment.
 
 
1. Business Activity and Summary of Accounting Policies and Accounts (continued)
 
Goodwill
The change in goodwill for the three months ended March 31, 2012 is comprised of the following (in thousands):
 
Intangible Assets
The Company capitalizes acquired intangible assets and license fee payments, which are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense related to intangible assets was $964,000, $2,003,000, $2,070,000, $510,000 (unaudited), and $498,000 (unaudited) for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, and the three month periods ended March 31, 2011, and 2012, respectively. Intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands):
 
 
 
1. Business Activity and Summary of Accounting Policies and Accounts (continued)
 
The estimated aggregate amortization expense for acquired intangible assets and license fees in each of the five years and thereafter are as follows (in thousands):
 
Long-Lived Asset Impairment
The Company reviews long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Management periodically re-evaluates the original assumptions and rationale utilized in the establishment of the carrying value and estimated lives of its long-lived assets. The criteria used for these evaluations include management's estimate of the assets continuing ability to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods as well as the strategic significance of any intangible asset in the Company's business objectives. If assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value
 
 
1. Business Activity and Summary of Accounting Policies and Accounts (continued)
 
of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets, which is determined by applicable market prices, when available. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $43,000, $77,000 and $0 for long-lived assets, respectively, included in operating income. During the three month period ended March 31, 2012, the Company did not record an impairment loss for long-lived assets.
Investment in Equity Securities
The Company holds an investment in a privately owned company for which market values are not readily available. The investment is carried at cost. The Company does not have control or significant influence over the investee.
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
All components of comprehensive income, including net income, are reported in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are recognized. Comprehensive income is defined as the change in stockholders' equity during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. Net income and other comprehensive income, which includes foreign currency translation of the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries' financial statements, are reported, net of their related tax effect, to arrive at comprehensive income.
Accounting for Share-Based Compensation
For stock options with time-based vesting, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, or "Black-Scholes model," to estimate the fair value of share-based compensation cost at the grant date, which is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period for all share-based awards granted and adjusted by modification or cancellation as necessary. For market-based and performance-based stock options, the Company uses a Monte Carlo model to estimate the grant date fair value and the expected vesting period.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the asset and liability method which requires deferred income tax assets and liabilities be computed for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are
 
 
1. Business Activity and Summary of Accounting Policies and Accounts (continued)
 
established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. The income tax provision or benefit is the tax payable or refund for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes under the authoritative guidance which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute criteria for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company's policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense. During 2011 and 2010, the Company recognized $167,000 and $527,000, respectively, in interest and penalties in the balance sheets or statements of operations. The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S., state, and foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2011, the Company's tax years beginning 2006 to date are subject to examination by taxing authorities.
Research and Development
Costs incurred in research and development activities are expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes the cost of acquired licenses when alternative future uses exist for such licenses.
Advertising
The Company participates in various advertising and marketing programs. All costs related to marketing and advertising the Company's products are expensed in the period incurred. Advertising and promotion costs were approximately $1,250,000, $2,079,000, $2,020,000, $317,000 (unaudited) and $446,000 (unaudited) for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010, and 2011, and the three month periods ended March 31, 2011 and 2012.
Acquisition, Integration, Restructuring, and Litigation Costs
Acquisition, integration, restructuring and litigation costs include transaction and integration costs associated with contemplated and completed business combinations, restructuring activities and non-recurring litigation costs.
 
 
1. Business Activity and Summary of Accounting Policies and Accounts (continued)
 
Litigation
During 2010, a lawsuit alleging patent infringement was filed against the Company. In May 2012, the Company received a letter demanding payment and effectively a limited injunction to resolve the pending litigation. The demand letter requested a settlement and license fee totaling $4,295,000 and on-going royalty payments. The Company believes the lawsuit is without merit and plans to defend itself vigorously and does not deem any loss probable at this time. The Company is unable to estimate any potential range of loss possible related to this claim.
Corporate Restructuring
The Company reorganized its corporate structure in February 2011 wherein all outstanding shares of common stock at the date of reorganization were transferred to a newly created Delaware Corporation, eBioscience Holding Company, Inc. (see Note 5)
Fair Value Measurements
Valuation techniques used to measure fair value under Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, which may be used to measure fair value, as follows:

In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as considers counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair value. The Company held no financial instruments subject to ASC Topic 820 as of December 31, 2011 and March 31, 2012. The following table presents the change in the Company's financial instruments subject to ASC Topic 820 measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2010 (in thousands):
 
 
The put option liability has been classified as a Level 3 liability, the fair value was determined using the average of the Company's estimated value for its common stock by following three valuation methodologies: 1) discounted cash flow; 2) comparable company analysis and 3) precedent transactions.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In January 2010, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which amends guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures. The new guidance requires disclosure of transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and also requires more detailed disclosure about the activity within Level 3 fair value measurements. This standard is effective for annual

and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the requirements related to Level 3 disclosures, which are effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010. The Company adopted the relevant provisions of this guidance, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
In June 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for the Presentation of Comprehensive Income. The issuance of the guidance is intended to improve the comparability, consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income. The guidance supersedes the presentation options in previous guidance and facilitates convergence of U.S. GAAP and IFRS by eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity and requiring that all non-owner changes in stockholders' equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The guidance is effective on a retrospective basis for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company adopted the guidance in the three month period ended March 31, 2012. As a result, the Company has retroactively presented the components of comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011 and the three month periods ended March 31, 2011 and 2012 in a separate statement of comprehensive income.
2. Long-Term Debt
In April 2008, the Company entered into a financial agreement with a bank for a secured revolving line of credit in the amount of $4,000,000. The interest rate for the outstanding amount on the line of credit was three-month LIBOR plus 2.5%, which was 2.80% as of December 31, 2010.
In September 2009, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, or Credit Facility, with the same bank. The Credit Facility comprised the pre-existing revolving line of credit and a term loan in the amount of $20,000,000, which required monthly minimum principal and interest payments with the remaining unpaid balance due in full on September 30, 2014. The interest rate for the term loan under the Credit Facility was three-month LIBOR plus 5.5%, with a minimum LIBOR floor of 1.75%. The effective rate as of December 31, 2010 was 7.25%.
 
 
2. Long-Term Debt (continued)
 
The Company paid a $150,000 commitment fee upon execution of the term loan and paid an additional $150,000 commitment fee on September 30, 2010. These deferred loan costs are included in notes payable in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company amortized the deferred loan costs to interest expense over the expected term of the Credit Facility.
The Company has several notes payable with principal amounts aggregating $2,149,000. The notes are comprised of a 1,200,000 ($1,554,000) Austrian government term loan administered by a bank that accrued interest ranging from 1.8% to 2.3%. The term loan has no maturity date as long as the Company meets certain criteria, including the loan not exceeding 30% of Austrian export sales or 100% of trade accounts receivable. The remaining government subsidy loans accrue interest ranging from 2.0% to 2.5% per annum, payable biannually, and become due as follows: March 31, 2012  86,000 ($112,000) and 100,000 ($129,000) payable in full on June 30, 2012. The payment due on March 31, 2012 was paid in April 2012.
In December 2010, the Company repurchased 160,000 shares of its Preferred Series A stock for $3,200,000 from a shareholder. In December 2010, the Company also repurchased and retired a total of 1,262,568 shares of its common stock from certain shareholders in exchange for cash of $2,300,000 and promissory notes payable totaling $22,951,000, which had a maturity date of June 30, 2011 and a fixed annual interest rate of 4.0%
In February 2011, in conjunction with the Company's corporate restructuring and completion of the Company's 2011 Credit Facility, all of the principal and interest associated with promissory notes payable were paid in full.
In February 2011 the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, or 2011 Credit Facility, with a consortium of lenders for a term loan in the amount of $45,000,000 and up to $10,000,000 in a revolving line of credit. On the effective date of the 2011 Credit Facility, $5,000,000 was drawn on the line. The Term-Loan requires quarterly minimum principal payments amortizing at 7.5%, 12.5%, 20%, 25% and 35% through the maturity of the Term Loan in 2016. The quarterly payments began in June 2011 and the final quarterly payment will be due in March 2016. The interest rate for the Term Loan under the Credit Facility is three-month LIBOR plus 5.5%, with a minimum LIBOR floor of 1.5%. The effective rate as of December 31, 2011 and March 12, 2012 was 7.0%.
The Company paid a total of $1,400,000 in arrangement fees, commitment fees and other closing costs related to the 2011 Credit Facility. These deferred loan costs, are included in notes payable in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company amortizes the deferred loan costs to interest expense over the expected term of the 2011 Credit Facility using the effective interest method.
 
 
2. Long-Term Debt (continued)
 
Of the proceeds from the 2011 Credit Facility, $18,500,000 was used to pay off the existing Credit Facility, accrued interest and a prepayment penalty.
The obligations under the 2011 Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of the U.S. assets of the Company. The 2011 Credit Facility contains certain covenants including, among others, requirements related to financial reporting, maintenance of operations, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, maintenance of interest rate protection and compliance with specified financial covenants, as well as restrictions related to liens, investments, business combinations, additional indebtedness, dispositions of assets or subsidiary interests, dividends, distributions, transactions with affiliates, and certain other changes in the business.
The Company's financial covenants, under the 2011 Credit Facility are as follows: (i) Maximum Leverage Ratio ranging from 2.75:1.00 at March 31, 2011 to 1.25:1.00 at December 31, 2014 and each quarter-end thereafter.; and (ii) Minimum Fixed Charge Ratio ranging from 1.25:1.00 at each quarter-end in 2011 to 1.50:1.00 at December 31, 2012 and each quarter-end thereafter; (iii) Maximum Annual Capital Expenditures of $5,000,000.

3. Commitments
Lease Commitments
In 2007 and 2009, the Company entered into two separate operating leases for adjacent buildings in San Diego, California, of which both leases expire in July 2015. The Company received a rent abatement for the first twelve months of the second lease. The Company also has several operating leases for space in Vienna, Austria and several vehicle leases, all of which expire at various times from December 2011 to December 2013. Rent expense was approximately $2,057,000, $2,746,000, $3,014,000, $684,000 (unaudited) and $753,000 (unaudited) for the years ending December 31, 2009, 2010, and 2011, and the three months ending March 31, 2011 and 2012, respectively.
Minimum annual lease payments under these operating leases in each of the five years and thereafter are as follows (in thousands):
 
For the year ending December 31, 2011, the $9,871,000 in future lease payments is comprised of $8,721,000 related to the San Diego facilities and $1,150,000 related to the Vienna facility.
For the three month period ended March 31, 2012, the $9,392,000 (unaudited) in future lease payments is comprised of $8,353,000 (unaudited) related to the San Diego facilities and $1,039,000 (unaudited) related to the Vienna facility.
License Agreement
The Company entered into an exclusive license agreement with a licensor on January 31, 2008, and under this agreement the Company is required to make payments based on technology,
 
 
3. Commitments (continued)
 
patent and commercial milestones. The term of the agreement is for the period until the last patent expires, unless either party elects to terminate early. A total of $4,930,000 is eligible to be paid upon reaching the technology ($1,680,000), commercial ($1,000,000) and patent ($2,250,000) milestones.
As of December 31, 2011, a total of $250,000 in technology milestones had been met and paid. Remaining eligible technology milestones of $1,680,000 are not expected to be paid.
The patent milestone payments are based on the issuance of any of the pending U.S. patents as of the effective date of the license agreement. A payment of $250,000 is required upon the issuance of any of the patents. As of December 31, 2011, five patents were issued and a total of $1,000,000 in milestone payments had been made and $250,000 has been recorded in accrued liabilities. All milestone payments to date have been capitalized as intangible assets, to be amortized over the estimated useful life of the technology.
The commercial milestone payments are based on attainment of annual and cumulative net sales resulting from the sale of licensed products and licensed services. Upon reaching cumulative sales of $2,500,000, a payment of approximately $333,000 will be required. Additional payments of approximately $333,000 will be required upon reaching annual sales of $7,500,000 and $10,000,000 resulting from sales of licensed products and licensed services. As of December 31, 2011, it was deemed probable that the first commercial milestone would be achieved and the initial $333,000 milestone payment was recorded in accrued liabilities.
4. Income Taxes
The income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 consists of the following (in thousands):

Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2011 and 2010, are as follows (in thousands):
 
The difference between the Company's effective tax rate and the statutory rate are primarily related to the effects of stock-based compensation and the foreign rate differential.
 
 
4. Income Taxes (continued)
 
Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, de-recognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010 the Company had $2,652,000 and $2,767,000, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits.
Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, are $2,006,000 and $2,021,000 which would reduce the Company's effective tax rate if recognized. The Company does not anticipate there will be a significant change in the unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.
It is the Company's practice to include interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense. The Company recognized approximately $131,000 and $36,000 of interest and penalties in 2011, respectively, approximately $267,000 and $260,000 in interest and penalties for 2010, respectively, and approximately $154,000 and $247,000 of interest and penalties for 2009, respectively, related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
In August 2010, the Company was notified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of closure of its examination of the Company's 2008 federal income tax return. The IRS did not propose any adjustments to the Company's 2008 federal tax return as a result of the examination. Currently, the Company is undergoing a California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) audit for 2007-2009 tax years. However, the Company anticipates no material adjustments will result from the audit that may have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal and California examinations for years before 2008 and 2006, respectively.
In general, it is the practice and intention of the Company to reinvest the earnings of its non-U.S subsidiaries in those operations. As of December 31, 2011 the Company has not made a provision for U.S. or additional foreign withholding taxes on approximately $67,000 of undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanently invested overseas. Generally, such amounts become subject to U. S. taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability related to investments in these foreign subsidiaries.
 
 
5. Stockholders' Equity
Preferred Stock
Each share of Preferred Series A stock (Preferred A) and Preferred Series B stock (Preferred B) was convertible into shares of common stock at the option of the holder. In December 2010, the Company purchased 160,000 shares of its Preferred Series A stock for $3,200,000 from a selling stockholder.
As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the number of common shares reserved for the conversion of Preferred A was 0 for both periods and Preferred B was 0 and 4,900,000, respectively. The conversion price for Preferred A was $0.625 per share and for Preferred B was $1.00 per share.
Preferred stockholders were also entitled to proportional anti-dilution protection for stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like.
Each share of preferred stock would have automatically converted into common stock: (i) upon the consent of the holders of a majority of the shares of all preferred stock, voting as a single class; (ii) upon the closing of a firm commitment for a public offering of not less than $15,000,000 and where the offering price was at least $2.50 per share appropriately adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like (prior to the deduction of underwriting commissions and expenses); (iii) in the event the Company was acquired in a merger or acquisition transaction and where the consideration received was at least $2.50 per share; or (iv) in the event such conversion resulted in a higher liquidation distribution to such series of preferred stock than the Liquidation Preference.
Preferred stockholders had the right to vote and to receive noncumulative annual dividends of 8% of the per share liquidation preference before any dividend was declared or paid on any shares of common stock when and if declared by the Board of Directors. During 2011 and 2010, no dividends were declared or paid on shares of preferred or common stock.
The Company underwent a corporate restructuring in February 2011, whereby all outstanding shares of stock in eBioscience, Inc. were exchanged for an equal number of shares in the newly formed eBioscience Holding Company, Inc. Prior to this restructuring, in February 2011, the remaining 4,900,000 Preferred B shares were converted on a 1 to 1 ratio to common shares.
 
 
5. Stockholders' Equity (continued)
 
Common Stock
In December 2010, the Company repurchased and retired a total of 2,008,944 shares of its common stock from stockholders in exchange for cash of $17,227,000 and promissory notes payable in the amount of $22,951,000.
In November 2010, the Company sold 500,000 shares of its common stock for total proceeds of $10,000,000. In connection with this common stock issuance, a Put option right on 250,000 of the shares was given to the holder to sell the stock back to the Company at a Put price of $20.00 per share. The Put option was recorded as a liability on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and not part of stockholders' equity due to the right of the holder of the Put option being able to sell the stock back to the Company for cash. The Put option expired in March 2011 and the Put option liability was recorded to additional paid-in capital as of March 31, 2011.
In connection with the Company's corporate restructuring completed in February 2011, 254,444 shares of common stock were repurchased and retired from shareholders for $5,088,000.
Restricted Stock
Prior to 2009, the Company granted 731,756 shares of restricted stock to employees and non-employees. The restricted stock grants vested over various terms with a maximum vesting term of four years. The fair value of these restricted stock grants was determined to be $11.25 per share. The Company recorded $620,000 and $0 of expense for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively, associated with the vested portion of these awards.
The Company recorded additional expense of $262,000 due to the modification of a restricted stock award in 2010.
During 2010, the Company repurchased and retired 41,559 shares of restricted stock in net-exercise transactions in connection with the vesting of restricted stock with certain holders.
As of December 31, 2010 and 2011 and March 31, 2012, there were no shares of restricted stock outstanding.
 
 
5. Stockholders' Equity (continued)
 
During 2008, the Company issued 70,000 shares of restricted common stock to a licensor as part of an up-front license fee. The fair value of the restricted stock at the time of grant was $11.25 per share and the value of $788,000 was recorded in intangible assets.
In association with the restricted common stock grant, a Put option right was given to the holder to sell the stock back to the Company at the Put price, which was the greater of $12.50 per share or fair value. The Put option vested in shares of 35,000, 17,500 and 17,500 common stock after anniversaries one, two and three years, respectively. The Put option was recorded as a liability on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and not part of stockholders' equity due to the right of the holder of the Put option being able to sell the stock back to the Company for cash upon vesting.
The fair market value per share of common stock was determined to be $20.00 as of December 31, 2010, and 2011, respectively, and $20.00 (unaudited) as of March 31, 2012.
For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, the fair market value adjustments in the amount of $228,000, $648,000, and $0 to the Put option liability were recorded in Other income (expenses), net as "Gain (loss) on fair value adjustment  put options". In August 2010, the holder of the Put option accepted cash payment of $756,000 in exchange for 52,500 of its shares. In January 2011, the holder of the Put option exercised the remaining right and accepted cash payment of $350,000 in exchange for 17,500 of its shares. The shares that were put back to the Company were retired upon repurchase.
Stock Options
In July 2007, the Company established the 2007 Stock Plan (the 2007 Plan). The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2007 Plan is 4,000,000 and the maximum term of the options under the 2007 Plan is 10 years.
In January 2011, as part of the corporate reorganization of the Company, the Company terminated the 2007 Plan and assumed, under the eBioscience Holding Company, Inc. 2011 Stock Plan (the 2011 Plan), the issued and outstanding and unexercised options under the 2007 Plan. The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2011 Plan is 2,000,000 and the maximum term of the options under the 2011 Plan is 10 years.
As of December 31, 2011, the number of shares of common stock that could be issued under the 2011 Plan, including the assumed options from the 2007 Plan, was 3,609,000. As of March 31,
 
 
5. Stockholders' Equity (continued)
 
2012, the number of shares of common stock that could be issued under the 2011 Plan, including the assumed options from the 2007 Plan, was 3,608,292 (unaudited). Stock options under both Plans generally vest 25% after the first year and the remaining amount ratably over a three-year period.
Activity with respect to the Plan is summarized as follows:
 
Stock options vested and exercisable at December 31, 2011 totaled 866,396 with a weighted-average exercise price of $18.08 and a weighted-average remaining contractual life in years of 7.11.
Stock options vested and exercisable at March 31, 2012 totaled 947,725 (unaudited) with a weighted-average exercise price of $18.29 (unaudited) and a weighted-average remaining contractual life in years of 6.97 (unaudited).
The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $0, $8,679,000, $0, $0 (unaudited) and $0 (unaudited) for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, and for the three month periods ended March 31, 2011 and 2012.
 
 
5. Stockholders' Equity (continued)
 
The fair value of options granted to employees during 2009, 2010 and 2011 with vesting terms of time only was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:
 
Management's estimate of expected volatility was based on a sampling of three public companies with attributes similar to those of the Company. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury rate on instruments with terms similar to the expected lives of the options. Expected lives were determined by using the simplified method.
The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted for the years ended 2009, 2010 and 2011 was $8.36, $7.55 and $6.98 per share, respectively. There were no options granted for the period ended March 31, 2012. The Company recorded $3,105,000, $2,948,000, $3,043,000, $783,000 (unaudited) and $390,000 (unaudited) of expense for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010, and 2011, and for the three month period ended March 31, 2011 and 2012, respectively, associated with the vested portion of these awards.
As of December 31, 2011, total unrecognized employee compensation cost related to non-vested options was $2,653,000 and will be recorded as expense on a straight-line basis over a weighted average remaining term of approximately three years. As of March 31, 2012, total unrecognized employee compensation cost related to non-vested options was $2,252,000 (unaudited) and will be recorded as expense on a straight-line basis over a weighted average remaining term of approximately three years.
During 2010, the Company cancelled 682,449 of unvested stock options. The cancellation was considered a modification of an existing award and resulted in additional stock based compensation expense of approximately $490,000 recorded in the consolidated statements of income during 2010.
 
 
5. Stockholders' Equity (continued)
 
Warrants
In December 2010, the Company issued warrants that were exercisable for an aggregate of 54,200 shares of common stock. The warrants had an exercise price of $20.00 per share and expired on June 1, 2011. The fair value of the warrants was $61,000 and was determined by the Black-Scholes valuation model using a risk-free rate of 0.2%, volatility of 22% and an expected term of five months.
6. Employee Benefit Plan
The Company maintains a defined contribution plan which allows eligible employees to voluntarily make pre-tax deferred salary contributions. The Company may make matching contributions and additional contributions in amounts as it may determine. The contributions charged to operations related to the Company's employees totaled $212,000, $249,000, and $324,000 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively, and $127,000 (unaudited) for the three-month period ended March 31, 2012.
7. Subsequent Events (unaudited)
Subsequent events have been evaluated through the date these financial statements were issued.
On May 3, 2012, the Company amended its existing definitive agreement dated November 29, 2011 under which Affymetrix, Inc. will acquire the Company for $315 million in cash subject to usual adjustments.
 

Exhibit 99.2
On May 3, 2012, Affymetrix, Inc. ("Affymetrix" or the "Company"), Excalibur Acquisition Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Affymetrix ("Acquisition Subsidiary"), eBioscience Holding Company, Inc. ("eBioscience"), and a representative of the securityholders of eBioscience (the "Securityholders' Representative") entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Acquisition Agreement"), pursuant to which Acquisition Subsidiary will be merged with and into eBioscience (the "Acquisition"), with eBioscience surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Affymetrix. Affymetrix will pay approximately $315 million in cash to acquire eBioscience, subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Acquisition Agreement, based upon the amount of eBioscience's unpaid transaction expenses and its net cash and net working capital at the closing of the Acquisition. A portion of the purchase price will be placed in escrow and will be paid to Affymetrix or eBioscience securityholders based on any claims for indemnification by Affymetrix during the escrow period. The closing of the Acquisition is subject to certain closing conditions, including Affymetrix's receipt of financing for the Acquisition.
As required, the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements have been prepared in connection with the filing of Affymetrix' registration statement on Form S-3 on the date hereof. The unaudited pro forma financial statements below have been based on available information and assumptions that Affymetrix believes are reasonable including, without limitation, assumptions as to the amount of cash consideration to be paid to eBioscience securityholders, the type, amount and terms of the Acquisition financing to be obtained by Affymetrix and the amount of any fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Acquisition financing and the Acquisition. The actual amount of the cash consideration, which is subject to adjustment as described above, the type, amount and terms of the Acquisition financing actually obtained and the fees and expenses actually incurred may differ materially from these assumptions. These unaudited pro forma financial statements are presented for informational purposes only and are not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of operations or financial position that would have been reported had the Acquisition been completed as of the dates presented, and should not be taken as representative of our future consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
The following unaudited pro forma combined financial statements were prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and are based on the historical financial statements of Affymetrix and eBioscience. The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet as of March 31, 2012 combines the historical Affymetrix and eBioscience balance sheets as if the Acquisition and the related financing had closed on March 31, 2012. The unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and the year ended December 31, 2011 combine the historical Affymetrix and eBioscience statements of operations for each of these periods as if the Acquisition and the related financing had closed on January 1, 2011. The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements include adjustments, which are based upon preliminary estimates, to reflect the fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities of eBioscience. Accordingly, the pro forma adjustments to effect the allocation of fair value have been made solely for the purpose of providing pro forma financial statements based upon current estimates and available information, and are subject to revision based on a final determination of fair value, which may use different methodologies and assumptions. The final allocation of fair value will be determined after the completion of the Acquisition and will be based upon actual net tangible and intangible assets acquired as well as liabilities assumed, and actual direct acquisition costs. Any change in the fair value of the net assets of eBioscience will change the amount of goodwill, as goodwill represents the difference between the consideration and the fair values of identifiable net assets acquired. Additionally, changes in eBioscience's transaction expenses, net cash and net working capital as of the closing will change the amount of goodwill recorded. Final acquisition method accounting adjustments may differ materially from the pro forma adjustments presented here.
The historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to events that are directly attributable to the Acquisition, factually supportable and, with respect to the statements of operations, expected to have a continuing impact on the results of the combined company. These unaudited pro forma combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and accompanying notes of eBioscience (contained elsewhere in this Form 8-K), and Affymetrix's historical financial statements and accompanying notes appearing in its periodic SEC filings including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2012. The adjustments that are included in the following unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are described in Note 4 below, which includes the lettered notes that are marked in those financial statements.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements do not assume any differences in accounting policies between Affymetrix and eBioscience. Upon consummation of the Acquisition, Affymetrix will conduct a review of eBioscience's accounting policies. As a result of that review, there may be differences between the accounting policies of the two companies that, when conformed, could have a material impact on the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements. At this time, the Company is not aware of any such differences.
2. BASIS OF PRO FORMA PRESENTATION
On May 3, 2012, Affymetrix, Acquisition Subsidiary, eBioscience and the Securityholders' Representative entered into an Acquisition Agreement, pursuant to which Acquisition Subsidiary will be merged with and into eBioscience, with eBioscience surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Affymetrix. The Acquisition Agreement provides that Affymetrix will pay approximately $315 million in cash to acquire eBioscience, subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Acquisition Agreement, based upon the amount of eBioscience's transaction expenses and its net cash and net working capital at the closing of the Acquisition. All eBioscience stock options will become fully vested immediately prior to the effective time of the Acquisition, other than certain unvested performance-based options to purchase shares of eBioscience common stock that will be terminated immediately prior thereto. The Acquisition Agreement provides that a portion of the purchase price will be placed in escrow and will be paid to Affymetrix or eBioscience securityholders based on any claims for indemnification by Affymetrix during the escrow period. The Acquisition will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
To provide cash to fund the Acquisition, Affymetrix has entered into a commitment letter (the "Commitment Letter") with General Electric Capital Corporation and Silicon Valley Bank (collectively, the "Lenders"), as well as certain securities affiliates of the Lenders, pursuant to which the Lenders have committed to provide senior secured credit facilities to Affymetrix as the borrower in an aggregate principal amount of $100 million, comprised of (i) $85 million under a five-year term loan facility (the "Term Loan") and (ii) $15 million under a five-year revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility" and, together with the Term Loan, the "Credit Facilities"). The Credit Facilities will be used to finance a portion of the transaction contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement, repay eBioscience's existing credit facilities, pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing and with the Credit Facilities and, in the case of any loans under the Revolving Credit Facility made after the closing date of the Acquisition, for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Acquisition Agreement also contemplates that Affymetrix will undertake an underwritten public offering of its convertible notes and/or other equity or debt securities pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-3 to provide additional cash to fund the Acquisition (the "Additional Financing"), or consummate a placement of equity or debt securities in place of all or a portion of the Additional Financing. In any event, through the Additional Financing and/or a placement of other equity or debt securities, Affymetrix intends to raise gross proceeds of approximately $105 million in addition to the proceeds of the Term Loan to fund the Acquisition. The funding of the Credit Facility is subject to several conditions, including the receipt by Affymetrix of at least $105 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of equity securities and/or convertible notes.
For purposes of these unaudited pro forma combined financial statements, Affymetrix has assumed that the Acquisition will be funded by (i) the net proceeds of the $85 million Term Loan, bearing interest at an assumed rate of 6.50% per annum and (ii) the net proceeds of an offering of $105 million in principal amount of senior convertible notes (the "Convertible Notes"), bearing interest at an assumed rate of 3.50% per annum. The Term Loan is expected to bear interest, at Affymetrix' option, either (a) during any interest period selected by Affymetrix, at the greater of (i) the offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars in the London interbank market for the relevant interest period adjusted for reserve requirements ("LIBOR") and (ii) 1.50% per annum, plus a spread of 5.00% per annum, or (b) at the greatest of (i) the prime rate from time to time announced by (or another national publication selected by General Electric Capital Corporation), (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (iii) LIBOR for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, plus a spread of 4.00% per annum. The actual interest rate of any Convertible Notes issued by Affymetrix will be determined at the time of the offering of such Convertible Notes. In each case, the actual interest rate may differ. In addition, it is possible that, based on market conditions and other considerations, Affymetrix may increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes offered and/or consummate a placement of other equity or debt securities in substitution for all or a portion of the Convertible Notes. Any such change could materially affect the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements presented here.

3. PRELIMINARY ALLOCATION OF FAIR VALUE
For purposes of preparing the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements, Affymetrix estimated the total purchase price to be $315 million, which will be paid in cash. The purchase price is subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Acquisition Agreement, based upon the amount of eBioscience's unpaid transaction expenses and its net cash and net working capital at the closing of the Acquisition, and a portion of the purchase price will be placed in escrow and will be paid to Affymetrix or eBioscience securityholders based on any claims for indemnification by Affymetrix during the escrow period. To prepare the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements, the Company assumed that the estimated $315 million purchase price will be funded by a combination of cash and available-for-sale securities on hand at the closing date, borrowings under the Term Loan of $85 million and proceeds of an offering of $105 million in principal amount of Convertible Notes. The purchase price will be adjusted at the Acquisition closing date based on the fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities, and the amount of eBioscience's unpaid transaction expenses and its net cash and net working capital at the closing of the Acquisition. Final purchase accounting adjustments may differ materially from the pro forma adjustments presented here.
Preliminary Purchase Consideration
Preliminary purchase consideration is assumed to be funded as follows (in thousands):
 
Preliminary Allocation of Fair Value
Under the acquisition method of accounting, a preliminary estimate of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed with any excess of the purchase price over the value of net assets acquired recorded as goodwill is as follows:
 
Included in the total liabilities assumed are net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $67 million, primarily comprised of the tax impact of the difference between the fair value allocated to assets acquired and the historical tax basis of those assets. In addition, the above preliminary allocation of fair value excludes potential amounts related to certain litigation in which eBioscience is currently involved. The Acquisition Agreement provides that eBioscience security holders shall indemnify Affymetrix against damages arising out of or resulting from intellectual property litigation brought against eBioscience by a specified third party. The net assets acquired and unaudited pro forma results of operations do not reflect the potential outcome of this litigation, which is unable to be estimated at this current time.
The tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed exclude eBioscience's existing debt. Per the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, any amounts outstanding under existing eBioscience borrowings will be repaid at the Acquisition date, which repayment is assumed for the purposes of these unaudited pro forma combined financial statements to be funded by eBioscience cash on hand and cash proceeds received from the Acquisition.
Goodwill of approximately $151 million represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and identifiable intangible assets, and the knowledge and experience of the workforce in place. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, goodwill will not be amortized but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually or, more frequently if certain indicators are present.
Definite-lived purchased intangible assets and license fees are expected to total approximately $160 million and consist of customer base, developed technology, trademarks, trade names, other contractual agreements and license fees. The following table sets forth the preliminary components of intangible assets other than goodwill (in thousands, except estimated useful life):
 
4. UNAUDITED PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

Additionally, this adjustment also includes the amortization of deferred financing costs.
 
5. NON-RECURRING TRANSACTION FEES
The Company has incurred and will continue to incur certain non-recurring transaction fees to complete the Acquisition which are currently estimated to total approximately $12 million. The Company's non-recurring transaction fees incurred during the three months ended March 31, 2012 and during the year ended December 31, 2011 were approximately $2 million and $3 million, respectively. These non-recurring transaction fees are reflected as an adjustment to reduce selling, general and administrative expenses in the unaudited pro forma combined
 
statements of operations as Note 4, Unaudited Pro Forma Adjustments, footnote (O) above for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and year ended December 31, 2011, respectively, as they are non-recurring and directly attributable to the acquisition. Future transaction expenses that were not accrued but are expected to be incurred are estimated to total approximately $7 million and are reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet as of March 31, 2012 as an adjustment to cash and cash equivalents (see Note 4, Unaudited Pro Forma Adjustments, footnote (S) above).

On June 19, 2012, Affymetrix, Inc. ("Affymetrix") entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC as representatives of the several underwriters named in the agreement to sell $105,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (the "Notes"). The Notes are expected to be issued and sold in a public offering pursuant to the Company's effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-181781) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and the prospectus included therein, as supplemented by the preliminary prospectus supplement dated June 18, 2012, a free writing prospectus dated June 19, 2012 and the final prospectus supplement dated June 19, 2012. Affymetrix has granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to $10.0 million aggregate principal amount of additional Notes on the same terms and conditions, solely to cover over-allotments, if any.
Affymetrix expects the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to be approximately $100.3 million (assuming no exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option), after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. Affymetrix intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund a portion of the purchase price for its pending acquisition of eBioscience Holding Company, Inc. In the event that the acquisition of eBioscience is not consummated and Affymetrix does not elect to redeem the Notes, Affymetrix management will retain broad discretion over use of the net proceeds.
The above description of the Underwriting Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.

To the extent there are no additional Underwriters listed on Schedule I other than you, the term Representatives as used herein shall mean you, as Underwriters. The Company hereby confirms its agreement with the several Underwriters concerning the purchase and sale of the Securities, as follows:
1. . The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Securities Act"), a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-181781), including a prospectus (the "Base Prospectus"), relating to the securities to be issued from time to time by the Company. The Company has also filed with, or transmitted for filing to, or shall promptly hereafter file with or transmit for filing to, the Commission a final prospectus supplement relating specifically to the Securities pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act (the "Final Prospectus Supplement").

If the Company has filed an abbreviated registration statement pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act (the "Rule 462 Registration Statement"), then any reference herein to the term "Registration Statement" shall be deemed to include such Rule 462 Registration Statement. Any reference in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act, as of the effective date of the Registration Statement or the date of such Base Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be, and any reference to "amend", "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after such date under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act") that are deemed to be incorporated by reference therein.

Registration Statement
At or prior to the time when sales of the Securities were first made (the "Time of Sale"), the Company had prepared the following information (collectively, the "Time of Sale Information"): a Preliminary Prospectus dated June 18, 2012, and each "free-writing prospectus" (as defined pursuant to Rule 405 under the Securities Act) listed in Part I of Annex B hereto.
 
2. . (a) The Company agrees to issue and sell the Firm Securities to each Underwriter as provided in this Agreement, and each Underwriter, on the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements set forth herein and subject to the conditions set forth herein, agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, at a price equal to 96.25% of the principal amount thereof (the "Purchase Price"), plus accrued interest, if any, to the Closing Date, the principal amount of Firm Securities set forth opposite such Underwriter's name in Schedule I hereto.
Purchase of the Securities by the Underwriters
In addition, the Company agrees to issue and sell the Additional Securities to the Underwriters as provided in this Agreement, and the Underwriters, on the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements set forth herein and subject to the conditions set forth herein, shall have the option to purchase from the Company the Additional Securities at the Purchase Price, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from the Closing Date to the Additional Closing Date (as defined in Section 2(c)). The Company will not be obligated to deliver any of the Securities except upon payment for all the Securities to be purchased as provided herein.
If any Additional Securities are to be purchased, the amount of Additional Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter shall be the amount of Additional Securities which bears the same ratio to the aggregate amount of Additional Securities being purchased as the amount of Firm Securities set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule 1 hereto (or such amount increased as set forth in Section 11 hereof) bears to the aggregate amount of Firm Securities being purchased from the Company by the several Underwriters, subject, however, to such adjustments to eliminate Securities in denominations other than $1,000 as the Representatives in their sole discretion shall make.
The Underwriters may exercise the one-time option to purchase the Additional Securities, by written notice from the Representatives to the Company; provided any Additional Closing Date occurs within the 13 calendar day period from and including the Closing Date (the "Exercise Period"). Such notice shall set forth the aggregate principal amount of Additional Securities as to which the option is being exercised and the date and time when the Additional Securities are to be delivered and paid for, which may be the same date and time as the Closing Date but shall not be earlier than the Closing Date nor later than the tenth full business day (as hereinafter defined) after the date of such notice. Any such notice shall be given at least two Business Days prior to the date and time of delivery specified therein.
(b) The Company understands that the several Underwriters intend to make a public offering of the Securities as soon after the effectiveness of this Agreement as in the sole judgment of the Representatives is advisable, and initially to offer the Securities on the terms set forth in the Prospectus. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the several Underwriters may offer and sell Securities to or through any of its affiliates and that any such affiliate may offer and sell Securities purchased by it to or through the several Underwriters.
 
(c) Payment for and delivery of the Firm Securities shall be made at the offices of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton LLP at 9:00 A.M., New York City time on June 25, 2012, or at such other time or place on the same or such other date, not later than the fifth business day thereafter, as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing or, in the case of the Additional Securities, on the date and at the time and place specified by the Representatives in the written notice of the Underwriters' election to purchase such Additional Securities; provided such date and time is within the Exercise Period. The time and date of such payment for the Firm Securities is referred to herein as the "Closing Date" and the time and date for such payment for the Additional Securities, if other than the Closing Date, is herein referred to as the "Additional Closing Date".
(d) Payment for the Firm Securities shall be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account specified by the Company to the Representatives against delivery to the nominee of The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters, of one or more global notes representing the Firm Securities (collectively, the "Global Notes"), with any transfer taxes payable in connection with the sale of the Firm Securities duly paid by the Company. Payment for any Additional Securities shall be made on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as applicable, by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account specified by the Company to the Representatives against delivery to the nominee of DTC, for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters, of one or more Global Notes representing the Additional Securities, with any transfer taxes payable in connection with the sale of the Additional Securities duly paid by the Company. The Global Notes will be made available for inspection by the Representatives not later than 1:00 P.M., New York City time, on the business day prior to the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be.
(e) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, neither the Representatives nor any other Underwriter is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.

Indemnification and Contribution
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, directors, officers, agents and employees and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information (including any Time of Sale Information that has subsequently been amended), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in subsection (b) below.
Indemnification of the Underwriters.
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed upon that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives consists of the following information in the Prospectus furnished by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives: the concession and reallowance figures appearing in the third paragraph under the caption "Underwriting," the information regarding stabilization transactions contained in the tenth and eleventh
Indemnification of the Company.
 
paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting" and the information relating to making a market in the Notes under the caption "Summary  The Offering  Absence of a Public Market for the Notes."
(c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person, (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be paid or reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for the Underwriters, its affiliates, directors, officers, agents and employees and any control persons of the Underwriters shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless

such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution.
(e) The Company and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall any Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by any Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that any Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
Limitation on Liability.
pro
rata
 
(f) The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies.

Termination
10.

Payment of Expenses.
 
(b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9, (ii) the Company for any reason fails to tender the Securities for delivery to the Representatives or (iii) the Underwriters decline to purchase the Securities for any reason permitted under this Agreement, the Company agrees to reimburse each Underwriter for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby.
11. (a) . (a) If, on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date or an Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 11, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
Defaulting Underwriter
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities that remain unpurchased on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder on such date plus such Underwriter's pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase on such date) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate
 
principal amount of Securities that remain unpurchased on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement or, with respect to any Additional Closing Date, the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase Securities on the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 10 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
(d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
12. . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the Indemnified Persons referred to in Section 7 hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel for Affymetrix, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Underwriting Agreement dated June 19, 2012 (the "Underwriting Agreement") with you and the other several Underwriters named in Schedule I thereto under which you and such other Underwriters have severally agreed to purchase from the Company $[105,000,000]
1
aggregate principal amount of its 4.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (the "Securities"). The Securities are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture dated as of June 25, 2012 (the "Base Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture relating to the Securities dated as of June 25, 2012 (the "Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture") between the Company and the Trustee. The Securities are convertible on the terms set forth in the Indenture into shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Underlying Securities") of the Company.
We have examined originals or copies of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments as we have deemed necessary or advisable for the purpose of rendering this opinion.
 
 
 
We have also participated in the preparation of the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-181781) and Amendment No. 1 thereto (other than the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Incorporated Documents")) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), relating to the registration of securities (the "Shelf Securities") to be issued from time to time by the Company and have participated in the preparation of the preliminary prospectus supplement dated June 18, 2012 (the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement") relating to the Securities, the issuer free writing prospectus (as such term is defined in Rule 433 under the Act) containing the final terms of the Securities dated June 19, 2012 (the "Final Term Sheet") and the prospectus supplement dated June 19, 2012 relating to the Securities (the "Prospectus Supplement"), and have reviewed the Incorporated Documents. In addition, we have examined evidence that the registration statement was declared effective under the Act and the Indenture qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"), on June 14, 2012. The registration statement at the date of the Underwriting Agreement, including the Incorporated Documents and the information deemed to be part of the registration statement at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement," and the related prospectus (including the Incorporated Documents) dated June 14, 2012 relating to the Shelf Securities is hereinafter referred to as the "Basic Prospectus." The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, together with the Final Term Sheet are hereinafter referred to as the "Disclosure Package." The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities (or in the form first made available by the Company to the Underwriters to meet requests of purchasers of the Securities under Rule 173 under the Act), is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus."
In rendering the opinions expressed herein, we have, without independent inquiry or investigation, assumed that (i) all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic and complete, (ii) all documents submitted to us as copies conform to authentic, complete originals, (iii) all documents filed with or submitted to the Commission through its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval ("EDGAR") system (except for required EDGAR formatting changes) conform to the versions of such documents reviewed by us prior to such formatting, (iv) all signatures on all documents that we reviewed are genuine, (v) all natural persons executing documents had and have the legal capacity to do so, (vi) all statements in certificates of public officials and officers of the Company that we reviewed were and are accurate and (vii) all representations made by the Company as to matters of fact in the documents that we reviewed were and are accurate.
Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We have considered the statements included in the Preliminary Prospectus under the captions "Description of Debt Securities" and "Description of Notes," as supplemented by the information set forth in the Final Term Sheet, in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Debt Securities," "Description of Notes" and "Underwriting" and in the Registration Statement under Item 15, insofar as they summarize provisions of the Documents and the indemnification provisions relating to officers and directors under the Company's certificate of incorporation, by-laws and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. In our opinion, such statements fairly summarize these provisions in all material respects.
We have also considered the statements included in the Prospectus under the caption "U.S. Federal Tax Considerations," insofar as they purport to describe provisions of U.S. federal income tax laws or legal conclusions with respect thereto. In our opinion, such statements fairly and accurately summarize the matters referred to therein in all material respects.
In rendering the opinions in paragraphs (2) through (5) above, we have assumed that each party to the Documents has been duly incorporated and that each party to the Documents (other than the Company) is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. In addition, we have assumed that (i) the execution, delivery and performance by each party thereto of each Document to which it is a party, (a) are within its corporate powers, (b) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other constitutive documents of such party, (c) require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official and (d) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or any judgment, injunction, order or decree or any agreement or other instrument binding upon such party, provided that we make no such assumption to the extent that we have specifically opined as to such matters with respect to the Company, and (ii) each Document (other than the Underwriting Agreement) is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement of each party thereto (other than as expressly covered above in respect of the Company).
We are members of the Bars of the States of New York and California, and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of New York, the federal laws of the United States of America and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, except that we express no opinion as to any law, rule or regulation that is applicable to the Company, the Documents or such transactions solely because such law, rule or regulation is part of a regulatory regime applicable to any party to any of the Documents or any of its affiliates due to the specific assets or business of such party or such affiliate.
 
This opinion is rendered solely to you and the other several Underwriters in connection with the Underwriting Agreement. This opinion may not be relied upon by you or the other several Underwriters for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person (including any person acquiring Securities from the several Underwriters) or furnished to any other person without our prior written consent.

aggregate principal amount of its 4.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (the "Securities"). The Securities are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture dated as of June 25, 2012 (the "Base Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture relating to the Securities dated as of June 25, 2012 (the "Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture") between the Company and the Trustee. The Securities are convertible on the terms set forth in the Indenture into shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Underlying Securities") of the Company.
We have participated in the preparation of the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-181781) and Amendment No. 1 thereto (other than the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Incorporated Documents")) filed with the
 
 
 
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), relating to the registration of securities (the "Shelf Securities") to be issued from time to time by the Company and have participated in the preparation of the preliminary prospectus supplement dated June 18, 2012 (the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement") relating to the Securities, the issuer free writing prospectus (as such term is defined in Rule 433 under the Act) containing the final terms of the Securities dated June 19, 2012 (the "Final Term Sheet") and the prospectus supplement dated June 19, 2012 relating to the Securities (the "Prospectus Supplement"), and have reviewed the Incorporated Documents. The registration statement at the date of the Underwriting Agreement, including the Incorporated Documents and the information deemed to be part of the registration statement at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement," and the related prospectus (including the Incorporated Documents) dated June 14, 2012 relating to the Shelf Securities is hereinafter referred to as the "Basic Prospectus."

We have, without independent inquiry or investigation, assumed that all documents filed with or submitted to the Commission through its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval ("EDGAR") system (except for required EDGAR formatting changes) conform to the versions of such documents reviewed by us prior to such formatting.
The primary purpose of our professional engagement was not to establish or confirm factual matters or financial, accounting or quantitative information. Furthermore, many determinations involved in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus are of a wholly or partially non-legal character or relate to legal matters outside the scope of our opinion separately delivered to you today in respect of certain matters under the laws of the State of New York, the federal laws of the United States of America and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. As a result, we are not passing upon, and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and we have not ourselves checked the accuracy, completeness or fairness of, or otherwise verified, the information furnished in such documents (except to the extent expressly set forth in our opinion letter separately delivered to you today as to statements included in the Preliminary Prospectus under the captions "Description of Debt Securities" and "Description of Notes," as supplemented by the information set forth in the Final Term Sheet, in the Prospectus under the captions "U.S. Federal Tax Considerations," "Description of Debt Securities," "Description of Notes" and "Underwriting" and in the Registration Statement under Item 15). However,
 
in the course of our acting as counsel to the Company in connection with the review of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, we have generally reviewed and discussed with your representatives and your counsel and with certain officers and employees of, and independent public accountants for, the Company the information furnished, whether or not subject to our check and verification. We have also reviewed and relied upon certain corporate records and documents, letters from counsel and accountants and oral and written statements of officers and other representatives of the Company and others as to the existence and consequence of certain factual and other matters.
On the basis of the information gained in the course of the performance of the services rendered above, but without independent check or verification except as stated above:
 
 
 
 
 
In providing this letter to you and the other several Underwriters, we have not been called to pass upon, and we express no view regarding, the financial statements or financial schedules or other financial or accounting data included in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, or the Statement of Eligibility of the Trustee on

Based upon of the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
1. The Company has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in the United States in which it owns or leases properties, or conducts any business, so as to require such qualification, other than where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
2. Affymetrix Pte Ltd has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in the United States in which it owns or leases properties or conducts any business, to the extent such qualification is so required, other than where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
3. To my knowledge, other than as set forth, incorporated by reference or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental investigations, actions, suits or proceedings pending or threatened to which
 
the Company or any of its subsidiaries is or may be a party or to which any property of the Company or its subsidiaries is or may be the subject which, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect; to my knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others; and there are no current or pending legal, governmental or regulatory actions, suits or proceedings that are required under the Securities Act to be described in the Registration Statement and that are not so described in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus; and to my knowledge, there is no contract or other document of a character that is required under the Securities Act to be described in the Registration Statement, or to be filed as an exhibit thereto, that is not so described or filed.
4. The Company is not, and with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both would not be, in violation of or in default under (i) its certificate of incorporation or bylaws, (ii) any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to me to which the Company is a party or by which it or any of its properties is bound or (iii) any law or statute or any judgment, order, rule or regulation of any court or arbitrator or governmental or regulatory authority, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for violations and defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
5. The issue and sale of the Securities and the issuance by the Company of the Underlying Securities upon conversion of the Securities and the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Securities, the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement and the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated will not (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other material agreement or instrument known to me to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject or (ii) result in a violation of any applicable law or statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any of the Company's properties, except, in each case, as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
6. The statements incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus from Item 3 of Part I of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 and from Item 1 of Part II of the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed since such Annual Report, insofar as such statements constitute summaries of the legal matters, documents or proceedings referred to therein, fairly present as of the respective dates of such reports the information called for with respect to such legal matters, documents or proceedings.
7. No order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued, no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of such Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(1) under the
 
Act has been received by the Company and no proceeding for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Act against the Company or in connection with the offering is pending or, to my best knowledge, threatened by the Commission.

On June 25, 2012, Affymetrix, Inc. ("Affymetrix") completed the acquisition of eBioscience Holding Company, Inc. ("eBioscience"), a privately-held San Diego, California based company that offers flow cytometry and immunoassay reagents for immunology and oncology research and diagnostics (the "Acquisition"). The Acquisition was completed pursuant to an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger dated May 3, 2012 among Affymetrix, Excalibur Acquisition Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Affymetrix, eBioscience and a representative of the securityholders of eBioscience (the "Acquisition Agreement"). The Acquisition was previously announced by Affymetrix in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 4, 2012 and was funded, in part, by senior secured financing and proceeds from an offering of its 4.00% convertible senior notes due 2019 (the "Notes"), as further discussed below.
 
Credit Agreement
On June 25, 2012, Affymetrix entered into a credit agreement, dated as of June 25, 2012, by and among Affymetrix and its domestic subsidiaries, General Electric Capital Corporation ("GE Capital"), Silicon Valley Bank and the other financial institutions party thereto from time to time (collectively, the "Lenders"), as well as certain securities affiliates of the Lenders (the "Credit Agreement"). The following description of the Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.
The Credit Agreement provides for a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $85.0 million (the "Term Loan") and a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $15.0 million (the "Revolving Credit Facility" and, together with the Term Loan, the "Senior Secured Credit Facility"), each with a term of five years. Affymetrix borrowed a total of $85.0 million under the Term Loan on June 25, 2012. The borrowed funds were used to finance a portion of the Acquisition, repay eBioscience's existing credit facilities and pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing and with the Senior Secured Credit Facility. The term loan facility will amortize in quarterly installments in amounts resulting in an annual amortization of 10% during the first year, 15% during the second year, 15% during the third year, 20% during the fourth year and 40% during the fifth year after the closing date.
Interest
At the option of Affymetrix (subject to certain limitations), borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either a base rate or at the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), plus, in each case, an applicable margin.
Interest will be at the base rate plus 4.00% per annum, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 365 or 366 days (as applicable) and payable quarterly in arrears. The base rate will be equal to the greatest of (a) the rate last quoted by The Wall Street Journal (or another national publication selected by GE Capital) as the U.S. "Prime Rate," (b) the federal funds rate, plus 0.50% per annum and (c) LIBOR for an interest period of one month, plus 1.00% per annum. However, the base rate will not be less than a floor of 2.50% per annum.
Base Rate Option.
. Interest will be determined based on interest periods to be selected by Affymetrix of one, two, three or six months (and, to the extent available to all relevant lenders, nine or 12 months) and will be equal to LIBOR, plus 5.00%, calculated based on the actual number of days elapsed in a 360-day year. However, LIBOR will be deemed not to be less than a floor of 1.50% per annum. Interest will be paid at the end of each interest period or, in the case of interest periods longer than three months, quarterly.
LIBOR Option
Guarantors and Collateral
The loans and other obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are (i) guaranteed by substantially all of Affymetrix's domestic subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions and limitations) and (ii) secured by substantially all of the assets of Affymetrix and each guarantor (subject to certain exceptions and limitations).
Covenants
The Credit Agreement requires Affymetrix to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.5 to 1.0, a senior leverage multiple not exceeding initially 2.00 to 1.00 and stepping down to 1.50 to 1.00 and a total leverage multiple not exceeding initially 4.75 to 1.00 and stepping down to 3.50 to 1.00. The Credit Agreement also includes other covenants, including negative covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, limit Affymetrix', and that of certain of its subsidiaries', ability to, among other things: (i) incur additional debt, including guarantees by Affymetrix or its subsidiaries, (ii) make investments, pay dividends on capital stock, redeem or repurchase capital stock, redeem or repurchase the Notes or any subordinated obligations, (iii) create liens and negative pledges, (iv) make capital expenditures, (v) dispose of assets, (vi) make acquisitions, (vii) create or permit restrictions on the ability of Affymetrix' subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to Affymetrix, (viii) engage in transactions with affiliates, (ix) engage in sale and leaseback transactions, (x) consolidate or merge with or into other companies or sell all or substantially all Affymetrix' asset and (xi) change their nature of business, their organizational documents or their accounting policies.
The Credit Agreement also contains provisions requiring Affymetrix to make the following mandatory prepayments: (a) annual prepayments in an amount equal to 50% of excess cash flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement), subject to a leverage-based step-down, (b) prepayments in an amount equal to 100% of the net cash proceeds of issuances or incurrences of debt obligations of Affymetrix and its subsidiaries (other than debt incurrences expressly permitted by the Credit Agreement), (c) prepayments in an amount equal to 100% of the net proceeds of asset sales in excess of $2.5 million annually (subject to certain reinvestment rights) and (d) prepayments in an amount equal to any indemnification payments or similar payments received under the Acquisition Agreement, subject to certain exclusions.
Events of Default
The Credit Agreement also contains events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-default and cross-acceleration to other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, monetary judgment defaults in excess of specified amounts, bankruptcy or insolvency, actual or asserted invalidity or impairment of any part of the credit documentation (including the failure of any lien on a material portion of the collateral to remain perfected) and change of ownership or control defaults. In addition, the occurrence of a "fundamental change" under the Indenture (as defined below) governing the Notes or the indenture governing Affymetrix' senior convertible notes due 2038 would be an event of default under the Credit Agreement.
Certain of the Lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facility or their affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, certain commercial banking, financial advisory, and investment banking services in the ordinary course of business for Affymetrix, its subsidiaries and certain of its affiliates, for which they receive customary fees and commissions.
Indenture
On June 25, 2012, Affymetrix completed its registered underwritten public offering of $105.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes pursuant to an underwriting agreement with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan & Stanley & Co. LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein. The offering of the Notes was registered pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration Statement No. 333-181781, the "Registration Statement") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act'), including the prospectus supplement filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5) under the Act, dated June 19, 2012, to the prospectus contained in the Registration Statement, dated May 31, 2012.
Affymetrix issued the Notes under a base indenture (the "Base Indenture") and a first supplemental indenture (the "Supplemental Indenture" and together, the "Indenture"), dated June 25, 2012, between Affymetrix and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. Copies of the Base Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture are attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and Exhibit 4.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and the terms thereof are incorporated herein by reference. The following description is qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the Indenture.
 
Interest
The Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.00% per annum. Interest on the Notes is payable on July 1 and January 1 of each year beginning on January 1, 2013. The Notes will mature on July 1, 2019 unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted.
Ranking
The Notes are unsecured and rank senior in right of payment to any of Affymetrix' indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, and equal in right of payment to any of Affymetrix' unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated. The Notes are effectively junior in right of payment to any of Affymetrix' secured indebtedness (including amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facility) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Notes also are structurally subordinated in right of payment to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of Affymetrix' subsidiaries.
Conversion Rights
Holders of the Notes may convert their Notes into shares of Affymetrix' common stock at any time and from time to time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding July 1, 2019. The conversion rate will initially be 170.0319 shares of Affymetrix' common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $5.88 per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. In addition, Affymetrix will increase the conversion rate for holders who elect to convert Notes in connection with certain fundamental change transactions occurring on or prior to July 1, 2019, as described in the Indenture.
Optional Redemption
Affymetrix may not redeem the Notes before July 1, 2017. On or after that date, Affymetrix may redeem all or part of the Notes for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed if the last reported sale price per share of Affymetrix' common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending within five trading days prior to the date on which Affymetrix provides notice of redemption.
Fundamental Change
Holders may also require Affymetrix to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes, subject to specified exceptions, upon the occurrence of a "fundamental change" specified in the Indenture at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.
Events of Default
The Indenture contains customary terms, covenants and events of default. If an event of default (as defined therein) occurs and is continuing, either the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may declare the principal of the Notes and any accrued and unpaid interest immediately due and payable. In the case of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency relating to Affymetrix or any of its subsidiaries, the principal amount of the Notes shall automatically become and be immediately due and payable.
 
The information set forth above under the heading "Introductory Note" of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference.
The purchase price for the Acquisition was approximately $315.0 million in cash. A portion of the purchase price was placed in escrow and will be paid to Affymetrix or eBioscience securityholders based on any claims for indemnification by Affymetrix during the escrow period.
Additional information and details of the Acquisition Agreement were previously disclosed in Item 1.01 of Affymetrix' Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 4, 2012 and Item 8.01 of Affymetrix' Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 31, 2012, both of which are incorporated by reference into this Item 2.01. The foregoing description of the Acquisition Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Acquisition Agreement, a copy of which was included as Exhibit 2.2 to Affymetrix' Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 31, 2012 and which is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The information provided in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference.
 
(a) Financial Statements of Business Acquired
The audited consolidated financial statements of eBioscience as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of eBioscience as of March 31, 2012 and for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011 were included as Exhibit 99.1 to Affymetrix' Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 31, 2012, which is incorporated herein by reference.
(b) Pro Forma Financial Information
The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements reflecting the Acquisition were included as Exhibit 99.2 to Affymetrix' Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 31, 2012, which is incorporated herein by reference. The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements were prepared prior to the offering of the Notes. The actual interest rate of Notes was set at 4.00% per annum, 0.5% higher than the interest rate assumed in the pro forma combined financial statements, which results in a $0.5 million increase in pro forma interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 and a $0.1 million increase in pro forma interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2012.

The term "" as used with respect to any interest payment date (except a date for payment of defaulted interest) shall mean the date specified as such in the terms of the Securities of any particular series, or, if no such date is so specified, if such interest payment date is the first day of a calendar month, the fifteenth day of the next preceding calendar month or, if such interest payment date is the fifteenth day of a calendar month, the first day of such calendar month, whether or not such record date is a Business Day.

. Mutilated, Defaced, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
Upon the issuance of any substitute Security, the Issuer or the Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. In case any Security which has matured or is about to mature or has been called for redemption or surrendered for conversion or required repurchase in full shall become mutilated or defaced or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Issuer may instead of issuing a substitute Security, pay or authorize the payment of, or convert or authorize the conversion of, the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated or defaced Security), if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Issuer and to the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee such security or indemnity as any of them may require to save each of them harmless, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Issuer and the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof.

In the absence of such request, the Trustee shall destroy cancelled Securities held by it and deliver a certificate of destruction to the Issuer. The Issuer may, to the extent permitted by law, and directly or indirectly (regardless of whether such Securities are surrendered to the Issuer), repurchase Securities of any series in the open market or otherwise, whether by the Issuer or its Subsidiaries or through a private or public tender or exchange offer or through counterparties to private agreements, including by cash-settled swaps or other derivatives.

Temporary Securities of any series shall be issuable as registered Securities without coupons, of any authorized denomination, and substantially in the form of the definitive Securities of such series but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Securities, all as may be determined by the Issuer with the concurrence of the Trustee. Temporary Securities may contain such reference to any provisions of the Indenture as may be appropriate. Every temporary Security shall be executed by the Issuer and be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with like effect, as the definitive Securities. Without unreasonable delay the Issuer shall execute and shall furnish definitive Securities of such series and thereupon temporary Securities of such series may be surrendered in exchange therefor without charge at each office or agency to be maintained by the Issuer for that purpose pursuant to Section 3.02, and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of an Issuer Order, authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary Securities of such series a like aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall be entitled to the same benefits under the Indenture as definitive Securities of such series.
. Temporary Securities.
 
Section 2.12. . So long as any of the Securities of any series remain Outstanding there may be an Authenticating Agent for any or all such series of Securities which the Trustee shall have the right to appoint. Said Authenticating Agent shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon exchange, transfer or partial redemption thereof, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and shall be valid and binding for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. All references in the Indenture to the authentication of Securities by the Trustee shall be deemed to include authentication by an Authenticating Agent for such series. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Issuer and shall be a corporation that has a combined capital and surplus, as most recently reported or determined by it, sufficient under the laws of any jurisdiction under which it is organized or in which it is doing business to conduct a trust business, and that is otherwise authorized under such laws to conduct such business and is subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authorities. If at any time any Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with these provisions, it shall resign immediately. Any Authenticating Agent may at any time resign by giving written notice of resignation to the Trustee and to the Issuer. The Trustee may at any time (and upon written request by the Issuer shall) terminate the agency of any Authenticating Agent by giving written notice of termination to such Authenticating Agent and to the Issuer. Upon resignation, termination or cessation of eligibility of any Authenticating Agent, the Trustee may appoint an eligible successor Authenticating Agent acceptable to the Issuer. Any successor Authenticating Agent, upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder, shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent pursuant hereto.
Authenticating Agent
Section 2.13. If the Issuer shall establish pursuant to Section 2.01 that some or all of the Securities of a particular series are to be issued as a Global Security, then the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with Section 2.04, authenticate and deliver, a Global Security that shall (i) represent, and be issued in a denomination or aggregate denominations equal to the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities to be represented by a Global Security, (ii) be registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee, (iii) be delivered to the Trustee as custodian for the Depositary and (iv) bear a legend substantially to the following effect: "Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.13 of the Indenture, this Security may be transferred, in whole but not in part, only to another nominee of the Depositary or to a successor Depositary or to a nominee of such successor Depositary."
Global Securities.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.08, the Global Security of a series may be transferred, in whole but not in part and in the manner provided in Section 2.08, only to another nominee of the Depositary for such series, or to a successor Depositary for such series selected or approved by the Issuer or to a nominee of such successor Depositary.
 
Ownership of beneficial interests in a registered Global Security will be limited to Agent Members that have accounts with the Depositary or Persons that may hold interests through Agent Members. Upon the issuance of a registered Global Security, the Depositary will credit, on its book-entry registration and transfer system, the Agent Members' accounts with the respective principal or face amounts of the securities beneficially owned by the participants. Any dealers, underwriters or agents participating in the distribution of the Securities will designate the accounts to be credited. Ownership of beneficial interests in a Global Security will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership interests will be effected only through, records maintained by the Depositary, with respect to interests of Agent Members, and on the records of Agent Members, with respect to interests of Persons holding through Agent Members.
So long as the Depositary, or its nominee, is the registered owner of a registered Global Security, that Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or Holder of the Securities represented by the Global Security for all purposes under the Indenture. Except as described in this Section 2.13, Agent Members will not be entitled to have the Securities represented by the Global Security registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of the Securities in definitive form and will not be considered the owners or Holders of the Securities under the Indenture. Accordingly, each Agent Member owning a beneficial interest in a registered Global Security must rely on the procedures of the Depositary for that registered Global Security and, if a beneficial owner is not an Agent Member, such Person must rely on the procedures of the Agent Member through which the Person owns its interest, to exercise any rights of a Holder under the Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Depositary or its nominee may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person (including any Agent Member and any Person that holds a beneficial interest in a Global Security through an Agent Member) to take any action which a Holder is entitled to take under the Indenture or the Securities, and nothing herein will impair, as between the Depositary and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of a Holder of any Security.
Principal, premium, if any, and interest payments on Securities represented by a Global Security registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee will be made to the Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner of the registered Global Security. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any other agent of the Issuer, or any agent of the Trustee will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the registered Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to those beneficial ownership interests.
If at any time the Depositary for a series of the Securities notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such series or if at any time the
 
Depositary for such series shall no longer be registered or in good standing under the Exchange Act, or other applicable statute or regulation, and a successor Depositary for such series is not appointed by the Issuer within 90 days after the Issuer receives such notice or becomes aware of such condition, as the case may be, this Section 2.13 shall no longer be applicable to the Securities of such series and the Issuer will execute, and subject to Section 2.08, the Trustee will authenticate and deliver the Securities of such series in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security of such series in exchange for such Global Security. Upon the exchange of the Global Security for such Securities in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, the Global Security shall be cancelled by the Trustee.
In addition, if an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of a series has occurred and is continuing and a beneficial owner of any such Security requests that its beneficial interest therein be issued as a certificated Security, the Issuer will execute and, subject to Section 2.08, the Trustee will authenticate and deliver Securities of such series in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security of such series corresponding to such beneficial owner's beneficial interest in such Global Security.
Securities in definitive registered form issued in exchange for all or part of the Global Security pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee in writing. The Issuer and the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such instructions from the Depositary. The Trustee shall deliver such Securities to the Depositary for delivery to the Persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.
Section 2.14. . The Issuer in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers.
CUSIP Numbers
 
Section 3.01(a) The Issuer covenants and agrees for the benefit of each series of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid the principal of, and interest on, each of the Securities of such series at the place or places, at the respective times and in the manner provided in such Securities. The Issuer shall pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue principal on each series of Securities at the rate specified in the terms of such series of Securities to the extent lawful; it shall pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue installments of interest (without regard to any applicable grace period) at the same rate to the extent lawful. Unless otherwise provided in the Securities of any series, not later than 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the due date of any principal of or interest on any Securities, the Issuer will deposit with the Trustee (or paying agent) money in immediately available funds sufficient to pay such amounts, that if the Issuer or any affiliate of the Issuer is acting as paying agent, it will, on or before each due date, segregate and hold in a separate trust fund for the benefit of the Holders a sum of money sufficient to pay such amounts until paid to such Holders or otherwise disposed of as provided in the Indenture. In each case the Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee of its compliance with this paragraph.

(b) An installment of principal or interest will be considered paid on the date due if the Trustee (or paying agent, other than the Issuer or any affiliate of the Issuer) holds on that date money designated for and sufficient to pay the installment. If the Issuer or any affiliate of the Issuer acts as paying agent, an installment of principal or interest will be considered paid on the due date only if paid to the Holders.
(c) Payments in respect of the Securities represented by the Global Security are to be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holder of the Global Security. With respect to certificated Securities, the Issuer will make all payments (i) to Holders having an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or less of such series, by check mailed to the Holders of these Securities at their address as it appears in the Register and (B) to Holders having an aggregate principal amount of more than $5,000,000 of such series, either by check mailed to the Holders of these Securities or upon application by such a Holder to the Registrar not later than the relevant record date, by wire transfer in immediately available funds to that Holder's account within the United States, which application shall remain in effect until the Holder notifies, in writing, the Registrar to the contrary by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holders thereof or, if no such account is specified, by mailing a check to each Holder's registered address.

for payment or repurchase (a "") and, in the case of convertible Securities, for conversion (a ""), (b) where the Securities may be presented for registration of transfer and for exchange as in the Indenture provided and (c) where notices and demands to or upon the Issuer in respect of the Securities or of the Indenture may be given or served. The Issuer will give to the Trustee written notice of the location of any such office or agency and of any change of location thereof. Unless otherwise specified in accordance with Section 2.03, the Issuer hereby initially designates the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, as the office to be maintained by it for each such purpose. In case the Issuer shall fail to so designate or maintain any such office or agency or shall fail to give such notice of the location or of any change in the location thereof, presentations and demands may be made and notices may be served at the applicable Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee and the Issuer hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, notices and demands.

(a) that it will hold all sums received by it as such agent for the payment of the principal of or interest on the Securities of such series (whether such sums have been paid to it by the Issuer or by any other obligor on the Securities of such series) in trust for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities of such series or of the Trustee,
(b) that it will give the Trustee notice of any failure by the Issuer (or by any other obligor on the Securities of such series) to make any payment of the principal of or interest on the Securities of such series when the same shall be due and payable,

(d) that it will perform all other duties of paying agent as set forth in the Indenture.
The Issuer shall, on or prior to each due date of the principal of or interest on the Securities of such series, deposit with the paying agent a sum sufficient to pay such principal or interest so becoming due, and (unless such paying agent is the Trustee) the Issuer shall promptly notify the Trustee of any failure to take such action.
If an Issuer shall act as its own paying agent with respect to the Securities of any series, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of or interest on the Securities of such series, set aside, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities of such series a sum sufficient to pay such principal or interest so becoming due. The Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee of any failure to take such action.

. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.
If a successor Trustee is appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Issuer, the predecessor Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any applicable series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto prepared by and at the expense of the Issuer which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2) shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the predecessor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series as to which the predecessor Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the predecessor Trustee, and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of the Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts under separate indentures.

Securities so owned which have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as Outstanding if the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not the Issuer or any other obligor upon the Securities or any Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer or any other obligor on the Securities. In case of a dispute as to such right, the advice of counsel shall be full protection in respect of any decision made by the Trustee in accordance with such advice.

Except as aforesaid any such action taken by the Holder of any Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of such Security and of any Securities issued in exchange or substitution therefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon any such Security. Any action taken by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any or all series, as the case may be, specified in the Indenture in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon the Issuer, the Trustee and the Holders of all the Securities affected by such action.

Section 11.02. Notice of redemption to the Holders of any series to be redeemed as a whole or in part at the option
Notice of Redemption; Partial Redemptions.
 
of the Issuer shall be given by mailing notice of such redemption by first class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to such Holders of such series at their last addresses as they shall appear upon the Register. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives the notice. Failure to give notice by mail, or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Security of a series designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Security of such series.
The notice of redemption to each such Holder shall specify the principal amount of each Security of such series held by such Holder to be redeemed, the date fixed for redemption (which must be a Business Day), the redemption price, the place or places of payment, the CUSIP and/or ISIN numbers, if any, that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Securities, that such redemption is pursuant to the mandatory or optional sinking fund, or both, if such be the case, that interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in such notice and that on and after said date interest thereon or on the portions thereof to be redeemed will cease to accrue. Such notice shall also specify, in the case of convertible Securities, the procedures a Holder of such convertible Securities must follow to convert its Securities, the period during which such Securities will be convertible prior to the applicable redemption date, the applicable conversion rate or price for such Securities and the settlement method to be used upon conversion (if the settlement method is at the Issuer's election). In case any Security of a series is to be redeemed in part only the notice of redemption shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and shall state that on and after the date fixed for redemption, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities of such series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
The notice of redemption of Securities of any series to be redeemed shall be prepared and given by the Issuer or, at the Issuer's request with 15 days' notice to the Trustee (which notice period may be shortened with the Trustee's consent), prepared by the Issuer and given by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Issuer.
If less than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by lot or according to the Depositary's applicable procedures in the case of Securities represented by a Global Security, or, in the case of Securities not represented by a Global Security, the Trustee shall select, in such manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair, Securities of such series to be redeemed in whole or in part. Securities may be redeemed in part in multiples equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of such series or any multiple thereof. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuer in writing of the Securities of such series selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities of such series selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. If any Security selected for partial redemption is submitted for conversion in part after such selection, the portion of
 
the Security submitted for conversion shall be deemed (so far as may be possible) to be the portion selected for redemption. For all purposes of the Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities of any series shall relate, in the case of any Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Security which has been or is to be redeemed.
At least one Business Day prior to the redemption date specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in this Section, the Issuer will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more paying agents (or, if the Issuer is acting as its own paying agent, set aside, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 3.03) an amount of money sufficient to redeem on the redemption date all the Securities of such series so called for redemption at the appropriate redemption price, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption.
Section 11.03. If notice of redemption has been given as above provided, the Securities or portions of Securities specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the date and at the place stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, and on and after said date (unless the Issuer shall default in the payment of such Securities at the redemption price, together with interest accrued to said date) interest on the Securities or portions of Securities so called for redemption shall cease to accrue and such Securities shall cease from and after the date fixed for redemption to be entitled to any benefit or security under the Indenture, and the Holders thereof shall have no right in respect of such Securities except the right to receive the redemption price thereof and unpaid interest to the date fixed for redemption. On presentation and surrender of such Securities at a place of payment specified in said notice, said Securities or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Issuer at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption; provided that any payment of interest becoming due on or before the date fixed for redemption shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities registered as such on the relevant record date.
Payment of Securities Called for Redemption.
If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal shall, until paid or duly provided for, bear interest from the date fixed for redemption at the rate of interest or Yield to Maturity (in the case of an Original Issue Discount Security) borne by the Security and, if applicable, such Security shall remain convertible until the applicable redemption price has been paid or duly provided for.
The Issuer may not redeem Securities of a series on any date if the principal amount of such Securities has been accelerated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, and such acceleration has not been rescinded, on or prior to the date fixed for redemption (except in the case of an acceleration resulting from a default by the Issuer in the payment of the applicable redemption price with respect to such Securities).
 
Upon presentation of any Security redeemed in part only, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or on the order of the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Issuer, a new Security or Securities of such series, of authorized denominations, in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security so presented.

Mandatory and Optional Sinking Funds.
mandatory sinking fund payment
optional sinking fund payment
sinking fund payment date
In lieu of making all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to any series of Securities in cash, the Issuer may at its option (a) deliver to the Trustee Securities of such series theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except upon redemption pursuant to the mandatory sinking fund) by the Issuer or receive credit for Securities of such series (not previously so credited) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except as aforesaid) by the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.10 and, if applicable, receive credit for convertible Securities (not previously so credited) converted in accordance with their terms and so delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, (b) receive credit for optional sinking fund payments (not previously so credited) made pursuant to this Section, or (c) receive credit for Securities of such series (not previously so credited) redeemed by the Issuer through any optional redemption provision contained in the terms of such series. Securities so delivered or credited shall be received or credited by the Trustee at the sinking fund redemption price specified in such Securities.
Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee a written statement (which need not contain the statements required by Section 10.05) signed by an authorized officer of the Issuer (a) specifying the portion of the mandatory sinking fund payment to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion to be satisfied by credit of Securities of such series, (b) stating that none of the Securities of such series has theretofore been so credited, (c) stating that no defaults in the payment of interest or Events of Default with respect to such series have occurred (which have not been waived or cured) and are continuing and (d) stating
 
whether or not the Issuer intends to exercise its right to make an optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series and, if so, specifying the amount of such optional sinking fund payment which the Issuer intends to pay on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Any Securities of such series to be credited and required to be delivered to the Trustee in order for the Issuer to be entitled to credit therefor as aforesaid which have not theretofore been delivered to the Trustee shall be delivered for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.10 to the Trustee with such written statement (or reasonably promptly thereafter if acceptable to the Trustee). Such written statement shall be irrevocable and upon its receipt by the Trustee the Issuer shall become unconditionally obligated to make all the cash payments or payments therein referred to, if any, on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Failure of the Issuer, at least 60 days prior to such sinking fund payment date, to deliver such written statement and Securities specified in this paragraph, if any, shall not constitute a default but shall constitute, on and as of such date, the irrevocable election of the Issuer (i) that the mandatory sinking fund payment for such series due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date shall be paid entirely in cash without the option to deliver or credit Securities of such series in respect thereof and (ii) that the Issuer will make no optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series as provided in this Section.
The Trustee shall select, in the manner provided in Section 11.02, for redemption on such sinking fund payment date a sufficient principal amount of Securities of such series to absorb said cash, as nearly as may be, and shall (if requested in writing by the Issuer) inform the Issuer of the serial numbers of the Securities of such series (or portions thereof) so selected. Securities of any series which are (a) owned by the Issuer or an entity known by the Trustee to be directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer, as shown by the Register, and not known to the Trustee to have been pledged or hypothecated by the Issuer or any such entity or (b) identified in an Officer's Certificate at least 60 days prior to the sinking fund payment date as being beneficially owned by, and not pledged or hypothecated by, the Issuer or an entity directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer shall be excluded from Securities of such series eligible for selection for redemption. The notice of redemption of the Securities of such series to be redeemed shall be prepared and given by the Issuer or, at the Issuer's request, prepared by the Issuer and given by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Issuer in substantially the manner provided in Section 11.02 (and with the effect provided in Section 11.03) for the redemption of Securities of such series in part at the option of the Issuer. The amount of any sinking fund payments not so applied or allocated to the redemption of Securities of such series shall be added to the next cash sinking fund payment for such series and, together with such payment, shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section. Any and all sinking fund amounts held on the stated maturity date of the Securities of any particular series (or earlier, if such maturity is accelerated), which are not held for the payment or redemption of particular Securities of such series, shall be applied, together with other amounts, if necessary, sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the principal of, and interest on, the Securities of such series
 
at maturity. The Issuer's obligation to make a mandatory or optional sinking fund payment shall automatically be reduced by an amount equal to the sinking fund redemption price allocable to any convertible Securities or portions thereof called for redemption pursuant to the preceding paragraph on any sinking fund payment date and converted in accordance with their terms; provided, that, if the Trustee is not the conversion agent for the Securities, the Issuer or such conversion agent shall give the Trustee written notice prior to the date fixed for redemption of the principal amount of Securities or portions thereof so converted.
At least one Business Day before each sinking fund payment date, the Issuer shall pay to the Trustee in cash or shall otherwise provide for the payment of all interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption on Securities to be redeemed on the next following sinking fund payment date.
The Trustee shall not redeem or cause to be redeemed any Securities of a series with sinking fund amounts or mail any notice of redemption of Securities for such series by operation of the sinking fund during the continuance of a default in payment of interest on such Securities or of any Event of Default except that, where the mailing of notice of redemption of any Securities shall theretofore have been made, the Trustee shall redeem or cause to be redeemed such Securities, provided that it shall have received from the Issuer a sum sufficient for such redemption. Except as aforesaid, any amounts in the sinking fund for such series at the time when any such default or Event of Default shall occur, and any amounts thereafter paid into the sinking fund, shall, during the continuance of such default or Event of Default, be deemed to have been collected under Article 4 and held for the payment of all such Securities. In case such Event of Default shall have been waived as provided in Section 4.09 or the default cured on or before the 60th day preceding the sinking fund payment date in any year, such amounts shall thereafter be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date in accordance with this section to the redemption of such Securities.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused the Indenture to be duly executed as of the date set forth above.

The Trustee (and if different, the conversion agent) shall notify the Issuer of any conversion pursuant to this Article 8 on the Conversion Date for such conversion. No Notice of Conversion with respect to any Notes may be surrendered by a Holder thereof if such Holder has also delivered a Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice to the Issuer in respect of such Notes and not validly withdrawn such Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice in accordance with Section 9.02.
If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the Conversion Obligation with respect to such Notes shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted thereby) so surrendered.
(c) A Note shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the date (the "") that the Holder has complied with the requirements set forth in subsection (b) above.

(e) If a Holder submits a Note for conversion, the Issuer shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of the shares of Common Stock upon conversion, unless the tax is due because the Holder requests such shares to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name, in which case the Holder shall pay that tax. The conversion agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the shares of Common Stock being issued in a name other than the Holder's name until the Trustee receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax that is due by such Holder in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.
(f) Except as provided in Section 8.04, no adjustment shall be made for dividends on any shares issued upon the conversion of any Note as provided in this Article 8.
(g) Upon the conversion of an interest in a Global Security, the Trustee, or the Custodian at the direction of the Trustee, shall make a notation on such Global Security as to the reduction in the principal amount represented thereby.

As a result, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the relevant Conversion Date shall be deemed to be paid in full rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Notes are converted after the close of business on a Regular Record Date, Holders of such Notes as of the close of business on such Regular Record Date will receive the full amount of interest payable on such Notes on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion. Notes surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any Regular Record Date to the open of business on the immediately following Interest Payment Date must be accompanied by funds equal to the amount of interest payable on the Notes so converted on such Interest Payment Date; that no such payment shall be required (1) for conversions following the Regular Record Date immediately preceding the Maturity Date; (2) if the Issuer has specified a Fundamental Change Repurchase Date that is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date; (3) if the Issuer has specified a redemption date for the Notes that is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date; or (4) to the extent of any overdue amounts, if any overdue amounts exist at the time of conversion with respect to such Note.

(i) The Person in whose name the certificate for any shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion is registered shall be treated as a stockholder of record as of the close of business on the relevant Conversion Date. Upon a conversion of Notes, such Person shall no longer be a Holder of such Notes surrendered for conversion.
(j) The Issuer shall not issue any fractional share of Common Stock upon conversion of the Notes and shall instead pay cash in lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock issuable upon conversion based on the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the relevant Conversion Date.

(a) If the Effective Date of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change occurs prior to the Maturity Date and a Holder of the Notes elects to convert its Notes in connection with such Make-Whole Fundamental Change, the Issuer shall, under the circumstances described below, increase the Conversion Rate for the Notes so surrendered for conversion by a number of additional shares of Common Stock (the ""), as described below. A conversion of Notes shall be deemed for these purposes to be "in connection with" such Make-Whole Fundamental Change if the relevant Notice of Conversion is received by the conversion agent at any time during the period from, and including, the Effective Date of the Make-Whole Fundamental Change up to, and including, the Business Day immediately prior to the related Fundamental Change Repurchase Date (or, in the case of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change that would have been a Fundamental Change but for subclause (a) of the in clause 2 of the definition thereof, the 35th Trading Day immediately following the Effective Date of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change).

(b) Upon surrender of Notes for conversion in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change, the Issuer shall deliver shares of Common Stock, including the Additional Shares, in accordance with Section 8.02; , , that if, at the effective time of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change described in clause (2) of the definition of Fundamental Change, the Reference Property following such Make-Whole Fundamental Change is composed entirely of cash, for any conversion of Notes following the Effective Date of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change, the Conversion Obligation shall be calculated based solely on the Stock Price for the transaction and shall be deemed to be an amount of cash per $1,000 principal amount of converted Notes equal to the Conversion Rate (including any adjustment for Additional Shares), multiplied by such Stock Price. The Issuer shall notify the Holders of Notes and the Trustee of the Effective Date of any Make-Whole Fundamental Change and issue a press release announcing such Effective Date no later than five Business Days after such Effective Date.

(c) The number of Additional Shares, if any, by which the Conversion Rate shall be increased for conversions in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change shall be determined by reference to the table below, based on the date on which the Make-Whole Fundamental Change occurs or becomes effective (the "") and the price (the "") paid (or deemed to be paid) per share of Common Stock in the Make-Whole Fundamental Change. If the holders of Common Stock receive in exchange for their Common Stock only cash in a Make-Whole Fundamental Change described in clause 2 of the definition of Fundamental Change, the Stock Price shall be the cash amount paid per share. Otherwise, the Stock Price shall be the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the five Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the Effective Date of the Make-Whole Fundamental Change.

(d) The Stock Prices set forth in the column headings of the table below shall be adjusted as of any date on which the Conversion Rate of the Notes is otherwise adjusted. The adjusted Stock Prices shall equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate immediately prior to such adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. The number of Additional Shares set forth in the table below shall be adjusted in the same manner and at the same time as the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 8.04.
multiplied by
(e) The following table sets forth the hypothetical Stock Price and the number of Additional Shares to be added to the Conversion Rate per $1,000 principal amount of Notes pursuant to this Section 8.03:
 
The exact Stock Prices and Effective Dates may not be set forth in the table above, in which case:
(i) if the Stock Price is between two Stock Prices in the table above or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates in the table, the number of Additional Shares shall be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of Additional Shares set forth for the higher and lower Stock Prices and the earlier and later Effective Dates based on a 365-day year, as applicable;
(ii) if the Stock Price is greater than $15.00 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Stock Prices set forth in the column headings of the table above pursuant to subsection (d) above), no Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate; and
(iii) if the Stock Price is less than $4.705 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Stock Prices set forth in the column headings of the table above pursuant to subsection (d) above), no Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Conversion Rate per $1,000 principal amount of Notes exceed 212.5399, subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 8.04.
(f) Nothing in this Section 8.03 shall prevent an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 8.04 in respect of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change.
Section 8.04 The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Issuer if any of the following events occurs, except that the Issuer shall not make any adjustments to the Conversion Rate if Holders of the Notes participate (other than in the case of a share split or share combination), at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of the Common Stock and solely as a result of holding the Notes, in any of the transactions described in this Section 8.04, without having to convert their Notes, as if they held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to (i) the Conversion Rate, (ii) the principal amount of Notes held by such Holder of the Notes, divided by $1,000.
. Adjustment of Conversion Rate.
multiplied by
 
(a) If the Issuer issues solely shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on all or substantially all shares of its outstanding Common Stock, or if the Issuer effects a share split or share combination, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
where,
 
Any adjustment made under this Section 8.04(a) shall become effective immediately after the close of business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately after the open of business on the Effective Date for such share split or share combination, as the case may be. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 8.04(a) is declared that results in an adjustment under this clause Section 8.04(a) but not so paid or made or the outstanding shares of Common Stock are not split or combined, as the case may be, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution or to effect such split or combination, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution or share split or share combination had not been declared or announced.
(b) If the Issuer distributes to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding Common Stock any rights, options or warrants entitling them, for a period of not more than 45 calendar days from the declaration date for such distribution, to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock at a price per share less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration date for such issuance, the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
 
 
where,
 
Any increase made under this Section 8.04(b) shall be made successively whenever any such rights, options or warrants are distributed and shall become effective immediately after the close of business on the Record Date for such distribution. To the extent that shares of the Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights, options or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the increase with respect to the distribution of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. If such rights, options or warrants are not so distributed, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such Record Date for such distribution had not been fixed.
For purposes of this Section 8.04(b), in determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration date for such distribution, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Issuer for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors.
(c) If the Issuer distributes shares of its Capital Stock, evidences of its indebtedness, other assets or property of the Issuer or rights, options or warrants to acquire its Capital Stock or other securities, to all or substantially all holders of the outstanding Common Stock, excluding (i) dividends or distributions as to which an adjustment was effected pursuant to Section 8.04(a)
 
or Section 8.04(b), (ii) dividends or distributions paid in cash as to which an adjustment was effected pursuant to Section 8.04(d), and (iii) Spin-Offs as to which the provisions set forth below in this Section 8.04(c) shall apply (any of such shares of Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness, other assets or property or rights, options or warrants to acquire Capital Stock or other securities of the Issuer, the ""), then the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
Distributed Property
 
where,
 
Any increase made under the portion of this Section 8.04(c) above shall become effective immediately after the close of business on the Record Date for such distribution. If such distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if "FMV" (as defined above) is equal to or greater than "SP
0
" (as defined above), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each Holder of a Note shall receive, in respect of each $1,000 principal amount thereof, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of the Common Stock receive the Distributed Property, the amount of Distributed Property such Holder would have received if such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate in effect on the Record Date for the distribution. If the Board of Directors determines the "FMV" (as defined above) of any distribution for purposes of this Section 8.04(c) by reference to the actual or when-issued trading market for any securities, it shall in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the Record Date for such distribution.
With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 8.04(c) where there has been a distribution on the Common Stock of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Issuer, which Capital Stock or similar equity interest will be quoted or listed for trading on a U.S. National Securities Exchange after its distribution (a ""), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
Spin-Off
 
 
where,
 
The adjustment to the Conversion Rate under the preceding paragraph shall be calculated at the close of business on the last Trading Day of the Valuation Period, but shall be given effect at the close of business on the Record Date for such Spin-Off; that, for purposes of determining the Conversion Rate in respect of any conversion after the close of business on the Record Date for the Spin-Off but prior to the close of business on the 10th Trading Day immediately following, and including, the Ex-Dividend Date for the Spin-Off, references in the portion of this Section 8.04(c) to 10 Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the Ex-Dividend Date for such Spin-Off and the Conversion Date.
provided
If any such distribution that constitutes a Spin-Off is declared but not made, and such distribution has resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate, the Conversion Rate shall be re-adjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to make such distribution, to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.
For purposes of this Section 8.04(c) (and subject in all respect to Section 8.11), rights, options or warrants distributed by the Issuer to all holders of its Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Issuer's Capital Stock, including Common Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights, options or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (""): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of the Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future
Trigger Event
 
issuances of the Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 8.04(c) (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section Section 8.04(c) will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights, options or warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 8.04(c). If any such right, option or warrant, including any such existing rights, options or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights, options or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and Record Date with respect to new rights, options or warrants with such rights (in which case the existing rights, options or warrants shall be deemed to terminate and expire on such date without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights, options or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the immediately preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 8.04(c) was made, (1) in the case of any such rights, options or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or purchased without exercise by any holders thereof, upon such final redemption or purchase (x) the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights, options or warrants had not been issued and (y) the Conversion Rate shall then again be readjusted to give effect to such distribution, deemed distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or purchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights, options or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights, options or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or purchase, and (2) in the case of such rights, options or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights, options and warrants had not been issued.
For purposes of Section 8.04(a), Section 8.04(b) and this Section 8.04(c), if any dividend or distribution to which this Section 8.04(c) is applicable also includes one or both of:
(A) a dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock to which Section 8.04(a) is applicable (the ""); or
Clause A Distribution
(B) a dividend or distribution of rights, options or warrants to which Section 8.04(b) is applicable (the ""),
Clause B Distribution
then (1) such dividend or distribution, other than the Clause A Distribution and the Clause B Distribution, shall be deemed to be a dividend or distribution to which this Section 8.04(c) is applicable (the "") and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 8.04(c) with respect to such Clause C Distribution shall then be made, and (2) the Clause A Distribution and Clause B Distribution shall be deemed to immediately follow the Clause C Distribution and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 8.04(a) and Section Section 8.04(b) with respect thereto shall then be made, except that, if determined by the Issuer (I) the Record Date of the Clause A Distribution and the Clause B Distribution shall be deemed to be the Record Date of the Clause C Distribution and (II) any shares of Common Stock included in the Clause A Distribution or Clause B Distribution shall be deemed not to be
Clause C Distribution
 
"outstanding immediately prior to the close of business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution or immediately after the open of business on the effective date of such share split or share combination, as the case may be" within the meaning of Section 8.04(a) or "outstanding immediately prior to the close of business on the Record Date for such distribution" within the meaning of Section 8.04(b).
(d) If the Issuer pays any cash dividend or distribution to all or substantially all holders of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
 
where,
 
Any increase pursuant to this Section 8.04(d) shall become effective immediately after the close of business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to make or pay such dividend or distribution, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if "C" (as defined above) is equal to or greater than "SP
0
" (as defined above), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each Holder of a Note shall receive, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of shares of the Common Stock, the amount of cash that such Holder would have received if such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate on the Record Date for such cash dividend or distribution. For the avoidance of doubt, there will not be any adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 8.04(d) as a result of any distribution of Reference Property to holders of the Common Stock in connection with any Merger Event.
(e) If the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for the Common Stock, if the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender offer or exchange offer (the ""), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
Expiration Date
 
 
where,
 
The adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 8.04(e) shall be calculated at the close of business on the 10th Trading Day immediately following the Expiration Date, but shall be given effect at the close of business on the Expiration Date; that, for purposes of determining the Conversion Rate in respect of any conversion within the 10 Trading Days immediately following, and including, the Expiration Date, references in this Section 8.04(e) with respect to 10 Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the Expiration Date and the Conversion Date.
provided
(f) If the application of the formulas in clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 8.04 would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be made (other than as a result of a reverse share split or share combination). In no event will the Issuer adjust the Conversion Rate to the extent that the adjustment would reduce the Conversion Price below the par value per share of its Common Stock.
(g) Except as stated herein, the Issuer shall not adjust the Conversion Rate for the issuance of shares of its Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of its Common Stock or the right to purchase shares of its Common Stock or such convertible or exchangeable securities.
 
(h) In addition to those adjustments required by clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 8.04, and to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to the applicable rules of The NASDAQ Global Select Market, (i) the Issuer may increase the Conversion Rate of the Notes by any amount for a period of at least 20 Business Days if the Board of Directors determines that such increase would be in the Issuer's best interest and (ii) the Issuer may (but is not required to) increase the Conversion Rate to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase shares of Common Stock in connection with a dividend or distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares of Common Stock) or similar event. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding two sentences, the Issuer shall mail to the Holder of each Note at its last address appearing on the Register a notice of the increase at least 15 days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 8.04, for the avoidance of doubt, the Conversion Rate shall not be adjusted:
(i) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Issuer's securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan;
(ii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Issuer or any of the its Subsidiaries;
(iii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security not described in clause (ii) of this subsection and outstanding as of the date the Notes were first issued, subject to Section 8.11;
(iv) solely for a change in the par value of the Common Stock; or
(v) for accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes, if any.
(j) All calculations and other determinations under this Article 8 shall be made by the Issuer and all calculations of the Conversion Rate shall be made to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a share.
(k) The Issuer will not be required to make an adjustment in the Conversion Rate unless the adjustment would require a change of at least 1% in the Conversion Rate. However, the Issuer will carry forward any adjustment that is less than 1% of the Conversion Rate, take such carried-forward adjustments into account in any subsequent adjustment, and make such carried forward adjustments, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less than 1%, (i) annually on the anniversary of the first date of issue of the Notes and otherwise (ii)(x) on the Conversion Date for any Notes or (y) on the effective date of any Fundamental Change or Make-Whole Fundamental Change, unless such adjustment has already been made.
 
(l) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Issuer shall promptly file with the Trustee (and the conversion agent if not the Trustee) an Officer's Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officer's Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume without inquiry that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Issuer shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to each Holder of the Notes at its last address appearing on the Register. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
(m) For purposes of this Section 8.04, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Issuer so long as the Issuer does not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Issuer, but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.
Section 8.05Whenever any provision of the Indenture requires the Issuer to calculate the Last Reported Sale Prices or the Stock Price for purposes of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change over a span of multiple days, the Board of Directors shall make appropriate adjustments to each to account for any adjustment to the Conversion Rate that becomes effective, or any event requiring an adjustment to the Conversion Rate where the Record Date of the event occurs, at any time during the period when such Last Reported Sale Prices or Stock Prices are to be calculated.
. Adjustments of Prices.
Section 8.06 The Issuer shall provide, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares that are not reserved for other purposes or shares held in treasury, sufficient shares of Common Stock to provide for conversion of the Notes from time to time as such Notes are presented for conversion (assuming that at the time of computation of such number of shares, all such Notes would be converted by a single Holder of the Notes).
. Shares to be Fully Paid.
Section 8.07
. Effect of Recapitalizations, Reclassifications and Changes of the shares of Common Stock.
(a) In the case of:
(i) any recapitalization, reclassification or change of the Common Stock (other than changes resulting from a share split or combination),
(ii) any consolidation, merger or combination involving the Issuer,
(iii) any sale, lease or other transfer to a third party of the consolidated assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries substantially as an entirety, or
 
(iv) any statutory share exchange,
in each case, as a result of which the shares of Common Stock would be converted into, or exchanged for, stock, other securities, other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) (any such event, a ""), then, at and after the effective time of such Merger Event, the right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of Notes shall be changed into a right to convert such principal amount of Notes into the kind and amount of shares of stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) that a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to such Merger Event would have owned or been entitled to receive (the "", with each "" meaning the kind and amount of Reference Property that a holder of one share of Common Stock is entitled to receive) upon such Merger Event and, prior to or at the effective time of such Merger Event, the Issuer or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture permitted under Section 7.01(m) of the Base Indenture providing for such change in the right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of Notes; , , that at and after the effective time of the Merger Event the number of shares of Common Stock otherwise deliverable upon conversion of the Notes in accordance with Section 8.02 shall instead be deliverable in the amount and type of Reference Property that a holder of that number of shares of Common Stock would have received in such Merger Event.

however
If the Merger Event causes the Common Stock to be converted into, or exchanged for, the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election), then (i) the Reference Property into which the Notes will be convertible shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make such an election, and (ii) the unit of Reference Property for purposes of the immediately preceding paragraph shall refer to the consideration referred to in clause (i) attributable to one share of Common Stock. The Issuer shall notify Holders, the Trustee and the conversion agent (if other than the Trustee) of such weighted average as soon as practicable after such determination is made.
Such supplemental indenture described in the second immediately preceding paragraph shall provide for anti-dilution and other adjustments that shall be as nearly equivalent as is possible to the adjustments provided for in this Article 8. If, in the case of any Merger Event, the Reference Property includes shares of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) of a Person other than the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such Merger Event, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other Person and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the Holders of the Notes as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing, including to the extent required by the Board of Directors and practicable the provisions providing for the purchase rights set forth in Article 9.
(b) In the event the Issuer shall execute a supplemental indenture pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 8.07, the Issuer shall promptly file with the Trustee an Officer's Certificate briefly stating the reasons therefor, the kind or amount of cash, securities or property or asset that will comprise a unit of Reference Property after any such Merger Event, any adjustment to be made with respect thereto and that all conditions precedent have been complied
 
with, and shall promptly mail notice thereof to all Holders. The Issuer shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Holder, at its address appearing on the Register, within 20 days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
(c) The Issuer shall not become a party to any Merger Event unless its terms are consistent with this Section 8.07. None of the foregoing provisions shall affect the right of a Holder of the Notes to convert its Notes into shares of Common Stock as set forth in Section 8.01 and Section 8.02 prior to the effective date of such Merger Event.
(d) The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive Merger Events.
Section 8.08 (a) The Issuer covenants that all shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of Notes will be fully paid and non-assessable by the Issuer and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof.

(c) The Issuer further covenants that if at any time the Common Stock shall be listed on any national securities exchange or automated quotation system the Issuer will list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange or automated quotation system, any Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes.
Section 8.09 The Trustee and any other conversion agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder to determine the Conversion Rate (or any adjustment thereto) or whether any facts exist that may require any adjustment (including any increase) of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same. The Trustee and any other conversion agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities, property or cash that may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Note; and the Trustee and any other conversion agent make no representations with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Issuer to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Note for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Issuer contained in this Article. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Section 8.07 relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or property (including cash) receivable by Holders of the Notes upon the conversion of their Notes after any event referred to in such Section 8.07 or to

(b) Merger Event; or
(c) voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries;
then, in each case (unless notice of such event is otherwise required pursuant to another provision of the Indenture, excluding for the avoidance of doubt Section 8.04(l)), the Issuer shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and the conversion agent (if other than the Trustee) and to be mailed to each Holder at its address appearing on the Register, as promptly as possible but in any event at least 20 days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (i) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such action by the Issuer or one of its Subsidiaries or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record are to be determined for the purposes of such action by the Issuer or one of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) the date on which such Merger Event, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is expected to become effective or occur, and, if applicable, the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such Merger Event, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such action by the Issuer or one of its Subsidiaries, Merger Event, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up.
Section 8.11 To the extent the Issuer has a stockholder rights plan in effect upon conversion of the Notes, each share of Common Stock issued upon such conversion shall be entitled to receive the appropriate number of rights, if any, and the certificates representing the Common Stock issued upon such conversion shall bear such legends, if any, in each case as may be provided by the terms of any such stockholder rights plan, as the same may be amended from time to time. If at any time prior to conversion, however, the rights have separated from the shares of Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable stockholder rights plan so that the Holders would not be entitled to receive any rights in respect of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Issuer distributed to all or substantially all holders of outstanding Common Stock shares of Capital Stock of the Issuer, evidences of its indebtedness, other assets or property or rights, options or warrants to acquire its Capital Stock or other securities as provided in Section 8.04(c), subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.

In the event that any L/C Reimbursement Obligation is not repaid by the Borrower as provided in this clause (v) (or any such payment by the Borrower is rescinded or set aside for any reason), such L/C Issuer shall promptly notify Agent of such failure (and, upon receipt of such notice, Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender) and, irrespective of whether such notice is given, such L/C Reimbursement Obligation shall be payable on demand by the Borrower with interest thereon computed (A) from the date on which such L/C Reimbursement Obligation arose to the L/C Reimbursement Date, at the interest rate applicable during such period to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans and (B) thereafter until payment in full, at the interest rate specified in subsection 1.3(c) to past due Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans (regardless of whether or not an election is made under such subsection).
Reimbursement Obligations of the Borrower
(vi) .
Reimbursement Obligations of the Revolving Lenders
(1) Upon receipt of the notice described in clause (v) above from Agent, each Revolving Lender shall pay to Agent for the account of such L/C Issuer its Commitment Percentage of such Letter of Credit Obligations (as such amount may be increased pursuant to subsection 1.11(e)(ii)).
(2) By making any payment described in clause (1) above (other than during the continuation of an Event of Default under subsection 7.1(f) or 7.1(g)), such Lender shall be deemed to have made a Revolving Loan to the Borrower, which, upon receipt thereof by Agent for the benefit of such L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall be deemed to have used in whole to repay such L/C Reimbursement Obligation. Any such payment
 
that is not deemed a Revolving Loan shall be deemed a funding by such Lender of its participation in the applicable Letter of Credit and the Letter of Credit Obligation in respect of the related L/C Reimbursement Obligations. Such participation shall not otherwise be required to be funded. Following receipt by any L/C Issuer of any payment from any Lender pursuant to this clause (vi) with respect to any portion of any L/C Reimbursement Obligation, such L/C Issuer shall promptly pay to Agent, for the benefit of such Lender, all amounts received by such L/C Issuer (or to the extent such amounts shall have been received by Agent for the benefit of such L/C Issuer, Agent shall promptly pay to such Lender all amounts received by Agent for the benefit of such L/C Issuer) with respect to such portion.
(vii) . The obligations of the Borrower and the Revolving Lenders pursuant to clauses (iv), (v) and (vi) above shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement irrespective of (A) (i) the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision in any Letter of Credit, any document transferring or purporting to transfer a Letter of Credit, any Loan Document (including the sufficiency of any such instrument), or any modification to any provision of any of the foregoing, (ii) any document presented under a Letter of Credit being forged, fraudulent, invalid, insufficient or inaccurate in any respect or failing to comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (iii) any loss or delay, including in the transmission of any document, (B) the existence of any setoff, claim, abatement, recoupment, defense or other right that any Person (including any Credit Party) may have against the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other Person, whether in connection with any Loan Document or any other Contractual Obligation or transaction, or the existence of any other withholding, abatement or reduction, (C) in the case of the obligations of any Revolving Lender, (i) the failure of any condition precedent set forth in Section 2.2 to be satisfied (each of which conditions precedent the Revolving Lenders hereby irrevocably waive) or (ii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of any Credit Party and (D) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind of Agent, any Lender or any other Person or any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this clause (vii), constitute a legal or equitable discharge of any obligation of the Borrower or any Revolving Lender hereunder. However, the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the L/C Issuer from liability to the Borrower or any Revolving Lender to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower and each Revolving Lender to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower or such Revolving Lender that are caused by such L/C Issuer's gross negligence or willful misconduct in determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. No provision hereof shall be deemed to waive or limit the Borrower's right to seek repayment of any payment of any L/C Reimbursement Obligations from the L/C Issuer under the terms of the applicable L/C Reimbursement Agreement or applicable law.
Obligations Absolute
(d) . (i) . Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in reliance upon the representations and warranties of the Credit Parties contained herein, the Swingline Lender may, in its sole discretion, make Loans (each a "Swing
Swing Loans
Availability
 
Loan") available to the Borrower under the Revolving Loan Commitments from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date through the Final Availability Date in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed its Swingline Commitment; provided, however, that the Swingline Lender may not make any Swing Loan (x) to the extent that after giving effect to such Swing Loan, the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans would exceed the Maximum Revolving Loan Balance and (y) during the period commencing on the first Business Day after it receives notice from Agent or the Required Revolving Lenders that one or more of the conditions precedent contained in Section 2.2 are not satisfied and ending when such conditions are satisfied or duly waived. In connection with the making of any Swing Loan, the Swingline Lender may but shall not be required to determine that, or take notice whether, the conditions precedent set forth in Section 2.2 have been satisfied or waived. Each Swing Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan and must be repaid as provided herein, but in any event must be repaid in full on the Revolving Termination Date. Within the limits set forth in the first sentence of this clause (i), amounts of Swing Loans repaid may be reborrowed under this clause (i).
(ii) . In order to request a Swing Loan, the Borrower shall give to Agent a notice to be received not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on the day of the proposed Borrowing, which shall be made in a writing or in an Electronic Transmission substantially in the form of Exhibit 1.1(d) or in a writing in any other form acceptable to Agent duly completed (a "Swingline Request"). In addition, if any Notice of Borrowing of Revolving Loans requests a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, the Swingline Lender may, notwithstanding anything else to the contrary herein, make a Swing Loan to the Borrower in an aggregate amount not to exceed such proposed Borrowing, and the aggregate amount of the corresponding proposed Borrowing shall be reduced accordingly by the principal amount of such Swing Loan. Agent shall promptly notify the Swingline Lender of the details of the requested Swing Loan. Upon receipt of such notice and subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Swingline Lender may make a Swing Loan available to the Borrower by making the proceeds thereof available to Agent and, in turn, Agent shall make such proceeds available to the Borrower on the date set forth in the relevant Swingline Request or Notice of Borrowing.
Borrowing Procedures
(iii) .
Refinancing Swing Loans
(1) The Swingline Lender may at any time (and shall no less frequently than once each week) forward a demand to Agent (which Agent shall, upon receipt, forward to each Revolving Lender) that each Revolving Lender pay to Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such Revolving Lender's Commitment Percentage of the outstanding Swing Loans (as such amount may be increased pursuant to subsection 1.11(e)(ii)).
(2) Each Revolving Lender shall pay the amount owing by it to Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender on the Business Day following receipt of the notice or demand therefor. Payments received by Agent after 1:00 p.m. (New York time) may, in Agent's discretion, be deemed to be received on the next Business Day. Upon receipt by Agent of such payment (other than during the continuation of any Event of Default under subsection 7.1(f) or 7.1(g)), such Revolving Lender shall be deemed to have made
 
a Revolving Loan to the Borrower, which, upon receipt of such payment by the Swingline Lender from Agent, the Borrower shall be deemed to have used in whole to refinance such Swing Loan. In addition, regardless of whether any such demand is made, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default under subsection 7.1(f) or 7.1(g), each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to have acquired, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation in each Swing Loan in an amount equal to such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such Swing Loan. If any payment made by any Revolving Lender as a result of any such demand is not deemed a Revolving Loan, such payment shall be deemed a funding by such Lender of such participation. Such participation shall not be otherwise required to be funded. Upon receipt by the Swingline Lender of any payment from any Revolving Lender pursuant to this clause (iii) with respect to any portion of any Swing Loan, the Swingline Lender shall promptly pay over to such Revolving Lender all payments of principal (to the extent received after such payment by such Lender) and interest (to the extent accrued with respect to periods after such payment) on account of such Swing Loan received by the Swingline Lender with respect to such portion.
(iv) . Each Revolving Lender's obligations pursuant to clause (iii) above shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever, including (A) the existence of any setoff, claim, abatement, recoupment, defense or other right that such Lender, any Affiliate thereof or any other Person may have against the Swingline Lender, Agent, any other Lender or L/C Issuer or any other Person, (B) the failure of any condition precedent set forth in Section 2.2 to be satisfied or the failure of the Borrower to deliver a Notice of Borrowing (each of which requirements the Revolving Lenders hereby irrevocably waive) and (C) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of any Credit Party.
Obligation to Fund Absolute
1.2 .
Evidence of Loans; Notes
(a) The Term Loan made by each Lender with a Term Loan Commitment is evidenced by this Agreement and, if requested by such Lender, a Term Note payable to such Lender in an amount equal to the unpaid balance of the Term Loan held by such Lender.
(b) The Revolving Loans made by each Revolving Lender are evidenced by this Agreement and, if requested by such Lender, a Revolving Note payable to such Lender in an amount equal to such Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment.
(c) Swing Loans made by the Swingline Lender are evidenced by this Agreement and, if requested by such Lender, a Swingline Note in an amount equal to the Swingline Commitment.
1.3 .
Interest
 
(a) Subject to subsections 1.3(c) and 1.3(d), each Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the date when made at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR or the Base Rate, as the case may be, the Applicable Margin; provided Swing Loans may not be LIBOR Rate Loans. Each determination of an interest rate by Agent shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. All computations of (i) interest on LIBOR Rate Loans payable under this Agreement shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed and (ii) interest on Base Rate Loans payable under this Agreement shall be made on the basis of a 365 or 366 day year (as applicable) and actual days elapsed. Interest shall accrue during each period during which interest is computed from the first day thereof to the last day thereof.
plus
(b) Interest on each Loan shall be paid in arrears on each Interest Payment Date. Interest shall also be paid on the date of any payment or prepayment of the Term Loan in full and Revolving Loans on the Revolving Termination Date.
(c) Automatically while any Event of Default under subsection 7.1(a), 7.1(f) or 7.1(g) exists, at the election of Agent or the Required Lenders while any Event of Default under subsection 7.1(c) exists with respect to any covenant set forth in Article VI, or at the election of the Required Lenders while any other Event of Default exists, the Borrower shall pay interest (after as well as before entry of judgment thereon to the extent permitted by law) on the Loans from and after the date of occurrence of such Event of Default, at a rate per annum which is determined by adding two percent (2.0%) per annum to the Applicable Margin then in effect for such Loans (plus the LIBOR or Base Rate, as the case may be). All such interest shall be payable on demand of Agent or the Required Lenders.
(d) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of the Borrower hereunder shall be subject to the limitation that payments of interest shall not be required, for any period for which interest is computed hereunder, to the extent (but only to the extent) that contracting for or receiving such payment by the respective Lender would be contrary to the provisions of any law applicable to such Lender limiting the highest rate of interest which may be lawfully contracted for, charged or received by such Lender, and in such event the Borrower shall pay such Lender interest at the highest rate permitted by applicable law ("Maximum Lawful Rate"); , , that if at any time thereafter the rate of interest payable hereunder is less than the Maximum Lawful Rate, the Borrower shall continue to pay interest hereunder at the Maximum Lawful Rate until such time as the total interest received by Agent, on behalf of Lenders, is equal to the total interest that would have been received had the interest payable hereunder been (but for the operation of this paragraph) the interest rate payable since the Closing Date as otherwise provided in this Agreement.

Agent shall deliver to the Borrower on a monthly basis a loan statement setting forth such record for the immediately
 
preceding calendar month. Such record shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive evidence of the amount of the Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so, or any failure to deliver such loan statement shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder (and under any Note) to pay any amount owing with respect to the Loans or provide the basis for any claim against Agent.
(b) Agent, acting as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower solely for tax purposes and solely with respect to the actions described in this subsection 1.4(b), shall establish and maintain at its address referred to in Section 9.2 (or at such other address as Agent may notify the Borrower) (A) a record of ownership (the "Register") in which Agent agrees to register by book entry the interests (including any rights to receive payment hereunder) of Agent, each Lender and each L/C Issuer in the Term Loan, Revolving Loans, Swing Loans, L/C Reimbursement Obligations and Letter of Credit Obligations, each of their obligations under this Agreement to participate in each Loan, Letter of Credit, Letter of Credit Obligations and L/C Reimbursement Obligations, and any assignment of any such interest, obligation or right and (B) accounts in the Register in accordance with its usual practice in which it shall record (1) the names and addresses of the Lenders and the L/C Issuers (and each change thereto pursuant to Sections 9.9 and 9.22), (2) the Commitments of each Lender, (3) the amount of each Loan and each funding of any participation described in clause (A) above, and for LIBOR Rate Loans, the Interest Period applicable thereto, (4) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or paid, (5) the amount of the L/C Reimbursement Obligations due and payable or paid in respect of Letters of Credit and (6) any other payment received by Agent from the Borrower and its application to the Obligations.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Loans (including any Notes evidencing such Loans and, in the case of Revolving Loans, the corresponding obligations to participate in Letter of Credit Obligations and Swing Loans) and the L/C Reimbursement Obligations are registered obligations, the right, title and interest of the Lenders and the L/C Issuers and their assignees in and to such Loans or L/C Reimbursement Obligations, as the case may be, shall be transferable only upon notation of such transfer in the Register and no assignment thereof shall be effective until recorded therein. This Section 1.4 and Section 9.9 shall be construed so that the Loans and L/C Reimbursement Obligations are at all times maintained in "registered form" within the meaning of Sections 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Code.
(d) The Credit Parties, Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender or L/C Issuer, as applicable, for all purposes of this Agreement. Information contained in the Register with respect to any Lender or any L/C Issuer shall be available for access by the Borrower, Agent, such Lender or such L/C Issuer during normal business hours and from time to time upon at least one Business Day's prior notice.

Responsibility
(ii) . If any Revolving Lender is a Non-Funding Lender, all or a portion of such Non-Funding Lender's Letter of Credit Obligations (unless such Lender is the L/C Issuer that Issued such Letter of Credit) and reimbursement obligations with respect to Swing Loans shall, at Agent's election at any time or upon the Borrower's, any L/C Issuer's or Swingline Lender's, as applicable, written request delivered to Agent (whether before or after the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default), be reallocated to and assumed by the Revolving Lenders that are not Non-Funding Lenders or Impacted Lenders pro rata in accordance with their Commitment Percentages of the Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment (calculated as if the Non-Funding Lender's Commitment Percentage was reduced to zero and each other Revolving Lender's Commitment Percentage had been increased proportionately), provided that no Revolving Lender shall be reallocated any such amounts or be required to fund any amounts that would cause the sum of its outstanding Revolving Loans, outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations, amounts of its participations in Swing Loans and its pro rata share of unparticipated amounts in Swing Loans to exceed its Revolving Loan Commitment.
Reallocation
(iii) . Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, including Section 9.1, a Non-Funding Lender (other than a Non-Funding Lender who only holds Term Loan) shall not have any voting or consent rights under or with respect to any Loan Document or constitute a "Lender" or a "Revolving Lender" (or be, or have its Loans and Commitments, included in the determination of "Required Lenders", "Required Revolving Lenders" or "Lenders directly affected" pursuant to Section 9.1) for any voting or consent rights under or with respect to any Loan Document, provided that (A) the Commitment of a Non-Funding Lender may not be increased, extended or reinstated, (B) the principal of a Non-Funding Lender's Loans may not be reduced or forgiven, and (C) the interest rate applicable to Obligations owing to a Non-Funding Lender may not be reduced in such a manner that by its terms affects such Non-Funding Lender more adversely than other Lenders, in each case, without the consent of such Non-Funding Lender; provided further, that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all of the Lenders directly affected thereby which affects the Non-Funding Lender differently than other affected Lenders shall require the consent of the Non-Funding Lender.

Voting Rights

Agent shall be entitled to hold as cash collateral in a non-interest bearing account up to an amount equal to such Non-Funding Lender's pro rata share, without giving effect to any reallocation pursuant to subsection 1.11(e)(ii), of all Letter of Credit Obligations until the Obligations are paid in full in cash, all Letter of Credit Obligations have been discharged or cash collateralized and all Commitments have been terminated. Upon any such unfunded obligations owing by a Non-Funding Lender becoming due and payable, Agent shall be authorized to use such cash collateral to make such payment on behalf of such Non-Funding Lender. With respect to such Non-Funding Lender's failure to fund Revolving Loans or purchase participations in Letters of Credit or Letter of Credit Obligations, any amounts applied by Agent to satisfy such funding shortfalls shall be deemed to constitute a Revolving Loan or amount of the participation required to be funded and, if necessary to effectuate the foregoing, the other Revolving Lenders shall be deemed to have sold, and such Non-Funding Lender shall be deemed to have purchased, Revolving Loans or Letter of Credit participation interests from the other Revolving Lenders until such time as the aggregate amount of the Revolving Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Letter of Credit Obligations are held by the Revolving Lenders in accordance with their Commitment Percentages of the Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment. Any amounts owing by a Non-Funding Lender to Agent which are not paid when due shall accrue interest at the interest rate applicable during such period to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans. In the event that Agent is holding cash collateral of a Non-Funding Lender that cures pursuant to clause (v) below or ceases to be a Non-Funding Lender pursuant to the definition of Non-Funding Lender, Agent shall return the unused portion of such cash collateral to such Lender. The "Aggregate Excess Funding Amount" of a Non-Funding Lender shall be the aggregate amount of (A) all unpaid obligations owing by such Lender to Agent, L/C Issuers, Swingline Lender, and other Lenders under the Loan Documents, including such Lender's pro rata share of all Revolving Loans, Letter of Credit Obligations and Swing Loans, plus, without duplication, (B) all amounts of such Non-Funding Lender's Letter of Credit Obligations and reimbursement obligations with respect to Swing Loans reallocated to other Lenders pursuant to subsection 1.11(e)(ii).
Borrower Payments to a Non-Funding Lender
(v) . A Lender may cure its status as a Non-Funding Lender under clause (a) of the definition of Non-Funding Lender if such Lender (A) fully pays to Agent, on behalf of the applicable Secured Parties, the Aggregate Excess Funding Amount, plus all interest due thereon.

In the event that any reallocation of Letter of Credit Obligations
Fees
 
occurs pursuant to subsection 1.11(e)(ii), during the period of time that such reallocation remains in effect, the Letter of Credit Fee payable with respect to such reallocated portion shall be payable to (A) all Revolving Lenders based on their pro rata share of such reallocation or (B) to the L/C Issuer for any remaining portion not reallocated to any other Revolving Lenders.

(including policies of life, fire, theft, product liability, public liability, Flood Insurance, property damage, other casualty, employee fidelity, workers' compensation, business interruption and employee health and welfare insurance) with financially sound and reputable insurance companies or associations (in each case that are not Affiliates of the Borrower) of a nature and providing such coverage as is sufficient and as is customarily carried by businesses of similar size and character to the business of the Credit Parties and (ii) cause all such insurance relating to any Property or business of any Credit Party to name Agent as additional insured or lenders loss payee as agent for the Lenders, as appropriate. All policies of insurance on real and personal Property of the Credit Parties will contain an endorsement, in form and substance acceptable to Agent, showing loss payable to Agent (Form CP 1218 or equivalent and naming Agent as lenders loss payee as agent for the Lenders). Such endorsement, or an independent instrument furnished to Agent, will provide, to the extent reasonably obtainable, that the insurance companies will give Agent (i) at least 30 days' (or such shorter period as agreed to by Agent) prior written notice before any such policy or policies of insurance shall be canceled for reasons other than nonpayment of premium and (ii) at least 10 days' (or such shorter period as agreed to by Agent) prior written notice before any such policy or policies of insurance shall be canceled for nonpayment of premium. Reimbursement under any liability insurance maintained by such Credit Party pursuant to this Section 4.6 may be paid directly to the Person who shall have incurred liability covered by such insurance. In case of any loss involving damage to real property, equipment or inventory, such Credit Party shall make or cause to be made the necessary repairs to or replacements of such real property, equipment or inventory, and any proceeds of insurance maintained by such Credit Party pursuant to this Section 4.6 and received by Agent shall be released to such Credit Party as reimbursement for the costs of such repairs or replacements; that at the request of Agent, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, all insurance payments in respect of such equipment or inventory shall be paid to and applied by Agent as specified in subsection 1.10(c).

(b) Unless the Credit Parties provide Agent with evidence of the insurance coverage required by this Agreement, Agent may purchase insurance at the Credit Parties' expense to protect Agent's and Lenders' interests, including interests in the Credit Parties' and their Subsidiaries' properties. Agents shall endeavor to provide prompt notice to the Borrower if Agent shall elect to purchase insurance pursuant to this subsection 4.6(b); provided that Agent shall have no liability to any Credit Party for the failure to provide any such notice.

The Borrower may later cancel any insurance purchased by Agent, but only after providing Agent with evidence that there has been obtained insurance as required by this Agreement.

The costs of the insurance shall be added to the Obligations. The costs of the insurance may be more than the cost of insurance the Borrower may be able to obtain on its own.

8.8 .
Expenses; Indemnities; Withholding
(a) Each Lender agrees to reimburse Agent and each of its Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by any Credit Party) promptly upon demand, severally and ratably, for any costs and expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements of financial, legal and other advisors and Other Taxes paid in the name of, or on behalf of, any Credit Party) that may be incurred by Agent or any of its Related Persons in connection with the preparation, syndication, execution, delivery, administration, modification, consent, waiver or enforcement of, or the taking of any other action (whether through negotiations, through any work-out, bankruptcy, restructuring or other legal or other proceeding (including without limitation, preparation for and/or response to any subpoena or request for document production relating thereto) or otherwise) in respect of, or legal advice with respect to its rights or responsibilities under, any Loan Document.
(b) Each Lender further agrees to indemnify Agent and each of its Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by any Credit Party), severally and ratably, from and against Liabilities (including, to the extent not indemnified pursuant to Section 8.8(c), taxes, interests and penalties imposed for not properly withholding or backup withholding on payments made to or for the account of any Lender) that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against Agent or any of its Related Persons in any matter relating to or arising out of, in connection with or as a result of any Loan Document, any Related Agreement or any other act, event or transaction related, contemplated in or attendant to any such document, or, in each case, any action taken or omitted to be taken by Agent or any of its Related Persons under or with respect to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable to Agent or any of its Related Persons to the extent such liability has resulted primarily from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Agent or, as the case may be, such Related Person, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment or order.
 
(c) To the extent required by any applicable law, Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender under a Loan Document an amount equal to any applicable withholding tax. If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority asserts a claim that Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the appropriate certification form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or fails to establish an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax with respect to a particular type of payment, or because such Lender failed to notify Agent or any other Person of a change in circumstances which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any other reason), or Agent reasonably determines that it was required to withhold taxes from a prior payment but failed to do so, such Lender shall promptly indemnify Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by Agent as tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and together with all expenses incurred by Agent, including legal expenses, allocated internal costs and out-of-pocket expenses. Agent may offset against any payment to any Lender under a Loan Document, any applicable withholding tax that was required to be withheld from any prior payment to such Lender but which was not so withheld, as well as any other amounts for which Agent is entitled to indemnification from such Lender under this subsection 8.8(c).

If Agent delivers any such notice, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent. If, after 30 days after the date of the retiring Agent's notice of resignation, no successor Agent has been appointed by the Required Lenders that has accepted such appointment, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent from among the Lenders.

Effective immediately upon its acceptance of a valid appointment as Agent, a successor Agent shall succeed to, and become vested with, all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent under the Loan Documents.
(c) Any L/C Issuer may resign at any time by delivering notice of such resignation to Agent, effective on the date set forth in such notice or, if no such date is set forth therein, on the date such notice shall be effective. Upon such resignation, the L/C Issuer shall

The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation or interest for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Agent (in its capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. No party hereto shall institute (and the Borrower shall cause each other Credit Party not to institute) against any SPV grantee of an option pursuant to this clause (f) any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, liquidation or similar proceeding, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper of such SPV; provided, however, that each Lender having designated an SPV as such agrees to indemnify each Indemnitee against any Liability that may be incurred by, or asserted against, such Indemnitee as a result of failing to institute such proceeding (including a failure to be reimbursed by such SPV for any such Liability). The agreement in the preceding sentence shall survive the termination of the Commitments and the payment in full of the Obligations.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to a Lender that is a Non-Funding Lender or an Impacted Lender, Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, obtain a Replacement Lender and execute an Assignment on behalf of such Non-Funding Lender or Impacted Lender at any time with three (3) Business' Days prior notice to such Lender (unless notice is not practicable under the circumstances) and cause such Lender's Loans and Commitments to be sold and assigned, in whole or in part, at par. Upon any such assignment and payment and compliance with the other provisions of Section 9.9, such replaced Lender shall no longer constitute a "Lender" for purposes hereof; provided, any rights of such replaced Lender to indemnification hereunder shall survive.

Joint and Several

Creditor-Debtor Relationship
The relationship between Agent, each Lender and the L/C Issuer, on the one hand, and the Credit Parties, on the other hand, is solely that of creditor and debtor.

10.1 .
Taxes
(a) Each payment by any Credit Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings and all liabilities with respect thereto (and without deduction for any of them) (collectively, but excluding Excluded Taxes and all liabilities with respect thereto, the "Taxes"), except as required by any Requirement of Law.
 
(b) If any Taxes shall be required by any Requirement of Law to be deducted from or in respect of any amount payable under any Loan Document to any Recipient (i) such amount shall be increased as necessary to ensure that, after all required deductions for Taxes are made (including deductions applicable to any increases to any amount under this Section 10.1), such Recipient receives the amount it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the relevant Credit Party shall make such deductions, (iii) the relevant Credit Party shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxing authority or other authority in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law and (iv) within 30 days after such payment is made, the relevant Credit Party shall deliver to Agent an original or certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment or other evidence of payment reasonably satisfactory to Agent.
(c) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay, and authorizes Agent to pay in its name, any stamp, documentary, intangible, recording or similar tax, charges or similar levies imposed by any applicable Requirement of Law or Governmental Authority and all Liabilities with respect thereto (including by reason of any delay in payment thereof), in each case arising from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document or any transaction contemplated therein, except any such taxes, charges or similar levies that are imposed as a result of a present or former connection between the Secured Party and the jurisdiction imposing such Tax (other than connections arising from such Secured Party having executed, delivered, become a party to, performed its obligations under, received payments under, received or perfected a security interest under, engaged in any other transaction pursuant to or enforced any Loan Document or sold or assigned an interest in any Loan or Loan Document) with respect to an assignment (other than an assignment made pursuant to Section 9.22 or subsection 10.1(e)) (collectively, "Other Taxes"). The Swingline Lender may, without any need for notice, demand or consent from the Borrower, by making funds available to Agent in the amount equal to any such payment, make a Swing Loan to the Borrower in such amount, the proceeds of which shall be used by Agent in whole to make such payment. Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Other Taxes by any Credit Party, the Borrower shall furnish to Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.2, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof or other evidence of payment reasonably satisfactory to Agent.
(d) The Borrower shall reimburse and indemnify, within 30 days after receipt of demand therefor (with copy to Agent), each Recipient for all Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment made under any Loan Document and Other Taxes (including any Taxes and Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 10.1) paid by such Recipient and any liabilities arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. A certificate of the Recipient (or of Agent on behalf of such Secured Party) claiming any compensation under this clause (d), setting forth the amounts to be paid thereunder and delivered to the Borrower with copy to Agent, shall be conclusive, binding and final for all purposes, absent manifest error.
(e) Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 10.1 shall use its reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policies and
 
Requirements of Law) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office if such a change would reduce any such additional amounts (or any similar amount that may thereafter accrue) and would not, in the sole determination of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.
(f) (i) Each Non-U.S. Lender Party that, at any of the following times, is entitled to an exemption from United States withholding tax or is subject to such withholding tax at a reduced rate under an applicable tax treaty, shall (w) on or prior to the date such Non-U.S. Lender Party becomes a "Non-U.S. Lender Party" hereunder, (x) on or prior to the date on which any such form or certification expires or becomes obsolete, (y) after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form or certification previously delivered by it pursuant to this clause (i) and (z) from time to time if requested by the Borrower or Agent (or, in the case of a participant or SPV, the relevant Lender), provide Agent and the Borrower (or, in the case of a participant or SPV, the relevant Lender) with two completed originals of each of the following, as applicable: (A) Forms W-8ECI (claiming exemption from U.S. withholding tax because the income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business), W-8BEN (claiming exemption from, or a reduction of, U.S. withholding tax under an income tax treaty) and/or W-8IMY (together with appropriate forms, certifications and supporting statements) or any successor forms, (B) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender Party claiming exemption under Sections 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code, Form W-8BEN (claiming exemption from U.S. withholding tax under the portfolio interest exemption) or any successor form and a certificate in form and substance acceptable to Agent that such Non-U.S. Lender Party is not (1) a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (2) a "10 percent shareholder" of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code or (3) a "controlled foreign corporation" described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code or (C) any other applicable document prescribed by the IRS certifying as to the entitlement of such Non-U.S. Lender Party to such exemption from United States withholding tax or reduced rate with respect to all payments to be made to such Non-U.S. Lender Party under the Loan Documents. Unless the Borrower and Agent have received forms or other documents satisfactory to them indicating that payments under any Loan Document to or for a Non-U.S. Lender Party are not subject to United States withholding tax or are subject to such tax at a rate reduced by an applicable tax treaty, the Credit Parties and Agent shall withhold amounts required to be withheld by applicable Requirements of Law from such payments at the applicable statutory rate.
        (ii) Each U.S. Lender Party shall (A) on or prior to the date such U.S. Lender Party becomes a "U.S. Lender Party" hereunder, (B) on or prior to the date on which any such form or certification expires or becomes obsolete, (C) after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form or certification previously delivered by it pursuant to this clause (f) and (D) from time to time if requested by the Borrower or Agent (or, in the case of a participant or SPV, the relevant Lender), provide Agent and the Borrower (or, in the case of a participant or SPV, the relevant Lender) with two completed originals of Form W-9 (certifying that such U.S. Lender Party is entitled to an exemption from U.S. backup withholding tax) or any successor form.
        (iii) Each Lender having sold a participation in any of its Obligations or identified an SPV as such to Agent shall collect from such participant or SPV the documents described in this clause (f) and provide a copy of such documents to Agent.
 
        (iv) If a payment made to a Non-U.S. Lender Party would be subject to United States federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Non-U.S. Lender Party fails to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA, such Non-U.S. Lender Party shall deliver to Agent and the Borrower any documentation under any Requirement of Law or reasonably requested by Agent or the Borrower sufficient for Agent or the Borrower to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Non-U.S. Lender has complied with such applicable reporting requirements. Solely for purposes of this clause (iv), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(g) . If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 10.1 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 10.1(a)), it shall pay to the relevant Credit Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 10.1 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including taxes) of such Recipient and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such Credit Party, upon the request of such Recipient, shall repay to such Recipient the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection 10.1(g), in no event will the Recipient be required to pay an amount to a Credit Party pursuant to this subsection 10.1(g) the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-tax position then the Recipient would have been in if the indemnification payment or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its Tax Returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Credit Party or any other Person.

Illegality

Solely for purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 10.4 and under subsection 10.3(a): each LIBOR Rate Loan made by a Lender (and each related reserve, special deposit or similar requirement) shall be conclusively deemed to have been funded at the LIBOR used in determining the interest rate for such LIBOR Rate Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the interbank Eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such LIBOR Rate Loan is in fact so funded.
10.5 .
Inability to Determine Rates
If Agent shall have determined in good faith that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBOR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan or that the LIBOR applicable pursuant to subsection 1.3(a) for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding or maintaining such Loan, Agent will forthwith give notice of such determination to the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans hereunder shall be suspended until Agent revokes such notice in writing. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation then submitted by it. If the Borrower does not revoke such notice, the Lenders shall make, convert or continue the Loans, as proposed by the Borrower, in the amount specified in the applicable notice submitted by the Borrower, but such Loans shall be made, converted or continued as Base Rate Loans.

If a Lender fails to give notice fifteen (15) days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be payable fifteen (15) days from receipt of such notice.

Excluding these one-time items and recurring amortization of acquired intangible assets and release of step-up in inventory fair value, the Company would have reported a net loss of $1.2 million, or $0.02 per diluted share.

Affymetrix Announces Preliminary Revenue for Third Quarter 2012
Affymetrix, Inc. (Nasdaq: AFFX) today reported that based on preliminary financial data, the Company expects total revenue of approximately $80 million for the third quarter of 2012, with revenue of approximately $18 million from the eBioscience business. The Company expects to report cash-on-hand of approximately $39.6 million as of September 30, 2012, after a $3.5 million interest and principal payment on the Company's senior debt.
Santa Clara, Calif., October 8, 2012 -
 The Company believes that total revenue for the third quarter was negatively impacted by a tightening academic funding environment worldwide, primarily affecting its gene expression and eBioscience business units.
"Based on ongoing concerns about global academic funding as well as a weaker Euro, we now believe that total revenue for Affymetrix excluding eBioscience will be flat to slightly down for 2012 relative to the prior year," said Frank Witney, President and CEO. "We continue to believe that the Affymetrix business is stabilizing, with double digit revenue growth for the quarter in our cytogenetics and genotyping product lines as compared to the third quarter 2011. However, our gene expression and eBioscience business segments were weaker than expected in the quarter. Finally, the integration of eBioscience is on track and we have important new product development and commercial programs that are underway."
The Company will provide a more detailed business update and complete financial information when it reports its third quarter results after the close of the market on Wednesday, October 31, 2012. The Company is currently observing a pre-earnings quiet period and will not make further comments about its third quarter results in the interim.
Affymetrix's management team will host a conference call on October 31, 2012 at 2:00 p.m. PT.

AFFYMETRIX REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2012 RESULTS
Affymetrix, Inc., (NASDAQ: AFFX) today reported its operating results for the third quarter of 2012. Total revenue for the quarter was $79.6 million, including approximately $17.6 million in revenue from eBioscience during the third quarter of 2012. This compares to total revenue of $64.0 million for the same period of 2011.
Santa Clara, Calif.
November 5, 2012
The Company reported a net loss of approximately $17.9 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2012, which included the following one-time items:  (1) acquisition-related and integration costs of $1.9 million and (2) impairment of the West Sacramento facility of $4.0 million.  Excluding these one-time items and recurring amortization of acquired intangible assets of $5.0 million and release of step-up in inventory fair value of $4.5 million, the Company would have reported a net loss of $2.4 million, or $0.03 per diluted share. This compares to a net loss of $9.8 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the same period of 2011, which included one-time impairment charges on investments totaling $0.7 million and a reserve on a note receivable from a private biotechnology company of $2.2 million, and recurring amortization of acquired intangible assets of $1.5 million. Excluding these charges, net loss was $5.3 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2011.
Revenue for the third quarter of 2012 was comprised of product revenue of $72.7 million and service and other revenue of $6.9 million. Product revenue included consumable revenue of $50.5 million excluding eBioscience, instrument revenue of $4.6 million and revenue from eBioscience of $17.6 million. This compares to total revenue of $64.0 million in the third quarter of 2011, comprised of product revenue of $57.0 million and service and other revenue of $7.0 million. Product revenue included consumable revenue of $52.9 million and instrument revenue of $4.1 million in the third quarter of 2011.
For the third quarter of 2012, cost of product sales, including eBioscience, was $34.0 million, as compared to $24.6 million in the same period of 2011. Product gross margin was 53%, as compared to 57% in the same period of 2011, the decrease is due primarily to the amortization of the step-up in inventory fair value of $4.5 million. Excluding the inventory step-up amortization, product gross margin for the third quarter of 2012 was 57%. Cost of services and other was $4.0 million compared to $3.0 million in the same period of 2011.
For the third quarter of 2012, operating expenses were $52.8 million, including acquisition- and integration-related non-recurring costs of $1.9 million, and recurring amortization of acquired intangible assets of $3.4 million and eBioscience operating expense of approximately $7.5 million. This compared to operating expenses of $42.2 million in the same period of 2011.
"For the third quarter of 2012 we've continued to make steady progress in stabilizing our business. On a constant currency basis, our revenue excluding eBioscience for the third quarter of 2012 was down by about 2% as compared to the same period in the previous year," said Frank Witney, president and CEO. "In the third quarter of 2012, we generated revenue growth of more than 16% as compared to the third quarter of 2011 in our Genetic Analysis business, which was offset by continued headwinds in our Gene Expression unit.  With the addition of eBioscience, we have further diversified our revenues and added important capabilities to provide customers in translational medicine and clinical diagnostics with a comprehensive set of tools to improve healthcare outcomes. "

Affymetrix Announces Preliminary Fourth Quarter Revenue of $84 Million and Implements Corporate Restructuring to Accelerate Path to Profitability
Affymetrix, Inc., (NASDAQ: AFFX) today announced that based on preliminary financial data, the Company expects total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2012 will be approximately $84 million, including $18 million from its eBioscience business unit. Excluding eBioscience, the Company's revenue increased by 1% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, and eBioscience's revenue increased by approximately 5% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. For fiscal 2012, the Company expects total revenue of approximately $295 million.
Santa Clara, Calif.
January 8, 2013
The company also announced that it prepaid $9.6 million of its senior-secured debt and is implementing a corporate restructuring to accelerate the Company's path to profitability. The restructuring is expected to result in annualized savings of approximately $25 million based on 2013 run rates, of which $5 million is in cost-of-goods sold. As part of the restructuring, Affymetrix expects that more than 100 employees will leave the company, representing about 8% of its work force. The company expects to record a charge of approximately $7 million, the majority of which will be incurred during the first quarter of 2013.
"This restructuring will drive operational efficiency, and together with the sharpened focus of our development and commercial priorities, will accelerate our return to profitability," said Dr. Frank Witney, president and chief executive officer.
In conjunction with this announcement, the Company's EVP and general counsel John F. (Rick) Runkel will retire from Affymetrix effective March 31, 2013. Mr. Runkel will be succeeded by Ms. Siang Chin.  Ms. Chin joined the company in 2007 as vice president, chief corporate counsel.   Ms. Chin has practiced law for over 15 years; prior to joining the Company, she was associated with the law firms of Shearman & Sterling and Slaughter and May. The Company expects to retain Mr. Runkel in a consulting capacity to ensure a smooth transition.  In addition, the Company's EVP and CFO Tim Barabe will also retire from Affymetrix. Mr. Barabe will continue in his current capacity while the Company conducts a search for a successor.
"I would like to thank Tim and Rick for their years of service and the contributions that they have made to Affymetrix, including their efforts to ensure a smooth transition.  I will personally miss them as friends and colleagues," Dr. Witney said.
"This restructuring will help to improve our free-cash flow in 2013 and beyond, as well as enable us to accelerate the repayment of our senior debt," stated Tim Barabe, EVP & CFO. "In December we prepaid $9.6 million of our senior secured debt representing the entire principal due in 2013. This payment was funded in part from the sale of our manufacturing facility in Sacramento. We have reduced our senior debt to $73 million and cash-on-hand at year-end was approximately $35 million."
Affymetrix's management team will host a conference call on Thursday January 31, 2013 at 2:00 p.m. PT.

 "We are honored to partner with UK Biobank on this mission critical research initiative," said Dr. Frank Witney, President and CEO of Affymetrix. "Earlier this year, we outlined our strategy to broaden our reach into the translational medicine, molecular diagnostics, and applied markets as part of our long-term transformation plan.  This partnership reflects our efforts to strengthen our position in the growing translational medicine market and our commitment to work with visionary organizations such as the UK Biobank to produce the next generation of biological information that will improve healthcare. "
 "Large scale genotyping studies such as the one undertaken by UK Biobank demand a flexible and scalable genomics analysis technology that produces a large amount of high quality data quickly, consistently, and cost-effectively.  The unmatched flexibility, array reproducibility, and advanced design capabilities were key factors in UK Biobank adopting the . These platform capabilities have become increasingly important for genotyping studies in both the human and agbio markets as requirements shift away from very high-density, standardized designs toward customized high-fidelity arrays. We are very proud that our Axiom Genotyping Solution has been chosen for this incredibly important project," said Dr. Andy Last, EVP and General Manager of Genetic and Clinical Applications at Affymetrix.
Axiom Genotyping Solution
Affymetrix expects to begin delivering data for the study towards the end of 2013.  Affymetrix does not expect revenue from this contract to have a material impact in 2013, as it will start to recognize revenue in the latter part of this year, with the majority of the revenue expected to be recognized in 2014.

Affymetrix Announces Preliminary Revenue for First Quarter 2013
Affymetrix, Inc. (Nasdaq: AFFX) today reported that based on preliminary financial data, the Company expects total revenue of approximately $78 million for the first quarter of 2013, including revenue of approximately $19 million from eBioscience.  The Company expects to report cash-on-hand of approximately $38 million as of March 31, 2013.
Santa Clara, Calif., April 9, 2013 -
"Our revenues for the first quarter were below expectations, primarily due to continued headwinds in our gene expression business across all regions, in particular Japan, where we came in significantly short of plan." said Frank Witney, president and CEO. "Our genotyping and cytogenetics product lines generated solid growth for the quarter as compared to 2012 and eBioscience also had modest growth from the first quarter of last year.  As reported earlier, we ended the quarter with a major win securing the largest biobank genotyping study to date."
"Cash-on-hand at the end of March was approximately $38 million, after redeeming the remaining $3.9 million of our 3.5% convertible notes and prepaying $3.2 million of our senior-secured debt." said Tim Barabe, EVP and chief financial officer.  "Our senior secured debt is now at $70 million and debt repayment continues to be one of our priorities in 2013."
The Company will provide a more detailed business update and complete financial information when it reports its first quarter results after the close of the market on Wednesday, April 30, 2013.  The Company is currently observing a pre-earnings quiet period and will not make further comments about its first quarter results in the interim.

AFFYMETRIX REPORTS 2013 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
Affymetrix, Inc., (NASDAQ: AFFX) today reported its operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2013.
Santa Clara, Calif.
April 30, 2013
:
Results for the three months ended March 31, 2013
Product revenue for the first quarter of 2013 was $71.6 million and service and other revenue was $6.4 million. This compares to product revenue of $58.5 million and service and other revenue of $6.8 million in the first quarter of 2012. Product revenue for the first quarter of 2013 included Affymetrix core consumable revenue of $49.1 million, instrument revenue of $3.5 million and revenue from eBioscience of $19.0 million. Product revenue for the first quarter of 2012 included Affymetrix core consumable revenue of $53.8 million and instrument revenue of $4.7 million.
Total gross margin was 51%, as compared to 58% in the same period of 2012. Excluding non-GAAP adjustments such as the amortization of step-up in inventory fair value, total margin was 59% for both years. Please refer to the "Itemized Reconciliation Between GAAP and Non-GAAP Gross Margin" for a reconciliation of these GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
For the first quarter of 2013, operating expenses were $52.2 million on a GAAP basis as compared to $41.3 million in 2012. Excluding non-GAAP adjustments such as the amortization of acquired intangible assets and non-recurring charges, operating expenses were $43.6 million, compared to an adjusted total of $39.3 million in 2012. The increase in 2013 is primarily due to the acquisition of eBioscience in June 2012 offset by net savings in Affymetrix Core operating expense of approximately $2.4 million primarily driven by lower headcount and variable compensation expenditure following the restructuring announced January 11, 2013.  Please refer to the "Itemized Reconciliation Between GAAP and Non-GAAP Operating Expenses" for a reconciliation of these GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
"Although the quarter was a challenging one, we continue to focus on opportunities in translational science, molecular diagnostics and applied markets. We again demonstrated strong growth in our Genetic Analysis business segments of cytogenetics and genotyping and a modest increase in eBioscience," said Frank Witney, President and CEO. "In addition, we continue to pay down our senior debt which we have reduced from $85 million to approximately $70 million over the last 9 months."
Recent developments:
Affymetrix will host a conference call on April 30, 2013 at 2:00 p.m.  PT to review its operating results for the first quarter of 2013.
