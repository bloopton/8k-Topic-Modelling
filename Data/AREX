Morgan Securities Inc. ("JPMorgan") and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC ("Wachovia") are acting as representatives (each a "Representative" and together, the "Representatives"), an aggregate of 5,605,377 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock"), and Neo Canyon Exploration, L.P., a Texas limited partnership (the "Selling Stockholder"), proposes to sell to the Underwriters 2,061,290 shares of the Common Stock of the Company. The aggregate of 7,666,667 shares to be sold by the Company and the Selling Stockholder is herein called the "Underwritten Shares." At the option of the Underwriters, the Company proposes to issue and sell up to an additional 993,195 shares of Common Stock and the Selling Stockholder proposes to sell an additional 156,805 shares of Common Stock. The aggregate of 1,150,000 additional shares to be sold by the Company and the Selling Stockholder is herein called the "Option Shares." The Underwritten Shares and the Option Shares are herein referred to as the "Shares." The shares of Common Stock of the Company to be outstanding after giving effect to the sale of the Shares are herein referred to as the "Stock."
     The Company and the Selling Stockholder hereby confirm their agreement with the several Underwriters concerning the purchase and sale of the Shares, as follows:
     1. . The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Securities Act"), a registration statement (File No. 333-144512) including a prospectus, relating to the Shares. Such registration statement, as amended at the time it becomes effective, including the information, if any, deemed pursuant to Rule 430A, 430B or 430C under the Securities Act to be part of the registration statement at the time of its effectiveness ("Rule 430 Information"), is referred to herein as the "Registration Statement," and as used herein, the term "Preliminary Prospectus" means each prospectus included in such registration statement (and any amendments thereto) before it becomes effective, any prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(a) under the Securities Act and the prospectus included in the Registration Statement at the time of its effectiveness that omits Rule 430 Information, and the term "Prospectus" means the prospectus in the form first used (or made available upon request of purchasers pursuant to Rule 173 under the Securities Act) in connection with confirmation of sales of the Shares. If the Company has filed an abbreviated registration statement pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act (the "Rule 462
Registration Statement
 
Registration Statement"), then any reference herein to the term "Registration Statement" shall be deemed to include such Rule 462 Registration Statement. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.
     At the Time of Sale (as defined below), the Company had prepared the following information (collectively with the pricing information set forth on Annex C hereto, the "Time of Sale Information"): a Preliminary Prospectus dated October 24, 2007 (the "Marketing Preliminary Prospectus"), and each "free-writing prospectus" (as defined pursuant to Rule 405 under the Securities Act) listed on Annex C hereto. "Time of Sale" means 5:00 P.M. (Eastern time) on the date of this Agreement.
     2. .
Purchase of the Shares by the Underwriters
     (a) The Company agrees to issue and sell, and the Selling Stockholder agrees, severally and not jointly, to sell the Underwritten Shares to the several Underwriters as provided in this Agreement, and each Underwriter, on the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements set forth herein and subject to the conditions set forth herein, agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company and the Selling Stockholder at a price per share of $11.16 (the "Purchase Price") the number of Underwritten Shares (to be adjusted by you so as to eliminate fractional shares) determined by multiplying the aggregate number of Underwritten Shares to be sold by the Company and the Selling Stockholder by a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate number of Underwritten Shares to be purchased by such Underwriter as set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule 1 hereto and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of Underwritten Shares to be purchased by all the Underwriters from the Company and the Selling Stockholder hereunder. The public offering price of the Shares is not in excess of the price recommended by Wachovia, acting as a "qualified independent underwriter" within the meaning of Rule 2720 of the Rules of Conduct of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD").
     In addition, the Company agrees to issue and sell, and the Selling Stockholder agrees, severally and not jointly, to sell the Option Shares pro rata to the several Underwriters as provided in this Agreement, and each Underwriter, on the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements herein contained and subject to the conditions set forth herein, shall have the option to purchase, severally and not jointly, from the Company and the Selling Stockholder at the Purchase Price that portion of the number of Option Shares as to which such election shall have been exercised (to be adjusted by you so as to eliminate fractional shares) determined by multiplying such number of Option Shares to be sold by the Company and the Selling Stockholder by a fraction, the numerator of which is the maximum number of Option Shares which such Underwriter shall be entitled to be purchased as set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule 1 hereto and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of Option Shares which all of the Underwriters are entitled to be purchased.
     The Underwriters may exercise the option to purchase the Option Shares at any time in whole, or from time to time in part, on or before the thirtieth day following the date of the Prospectus, by written notice from the Representatives to the Company and the Selling Stockholder; provided, however, that such option may be exercised only for the purpose of covering any over-allotments that may be made by the Underwriters in the sale of the Firm Shares. No Option Shares shall be sold or delivered unless the Underwritten Shares previously have been, or simultaneously are, sold and delivered. Such notice shall set forth the aggregate number of Option Shares as to which the option is being exercised and the date and time when the Option Shares are to be delivered and paid for, which may be the same date and time as the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) but shall not be earlier than the Closing Date nor later than the tenth full business day (as hereinafter defined) after the date of such notice (unless such time and date are postponed
 
in accordance with the provisions of Section 12 hereof). Any such notice shall be given at least two business days prior to the date and time of delivery specified therein.
     (b) The Company and the Selling Stockholder understand that the Underwriters intend to make a public offering of the Shares as soon after the effectiveness of this Agreement as in the judgment of the Representatives is advisable, and initially to offer the Shares on the terms set forth in the Prospectus. The Company and the Selling Stockholder acknowledge and agree that the Underwriters may offer and sell Shares to or through any affiliate of an Underwriter and that any such affiliate may offer and sell Shares purchased by it to or through any Underwriter.
     (c) Payment for the Shares shall be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account specified by the Company with respect to the Shares to be purchased from the Company and to the account specified by the Attorneys-in-Fact (as defined below) with respect to the Shares to be purchased from the Selling Stockholder to the Representatives in the case of the Underwritten Shares, at the offices of Thompson & Knight LLP, 1700 Pacific Avenue, Suite 3300, Dallas, Texas 75201 at 9:00 A.M., Dallas time, on November 14, 2007, or at such other time or place on the same or such other date, not later than the fifth business day thereafter, as the Representatives, the Company and the Attorneys-in-Fact may agree upon in writing in the case of the Underwritten Shares or, in the case of the Option Shares, on the date and at the time and place specified by the Representatives in the written notice of the Underwriters' election to purchase such Option Shares. The time and date of such payment for the Underwritten Shares is referred to herein as the "Closing Date," and the time and date for such payment for the Option Shares, if other than the Closing Date, is herein referred to as the "Additional Closing Date."
     Payment for the Shares to be purchased on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, shall be made against delivery through the facilities of the Depository Trust Company ("DTC") to the Representatives for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters of the Shares to be purchased on such date in definitive form registered in such names and in such denominations as the Representatives shall request in writing not later than two full business days prior to the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, with any transfer taxes payable in connection with the sale of the Shares duly paid by the Company or the Selling Stockholder, as applicable. Any certificates for the Shares will be made available for inspection and packaging by the Representatives at the office of DTC or its designated custodian not later than 1:00 P.M., Dallas time, on the business day prior to the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be.
     (d) The Company and the Selling Stockholder acknowledge and agree that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company and the Selling Stockholder with respect to the offering of Shares contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company, the Selling Stockholder, or any other person. Additionally, neither the Representatives nor any other Underwriter is advising the Company, the Selling Stockholder, or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. Each of the Company and the Selling Stockholder shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company or the Selling Stockholder with respect thereto. Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the Selling Stockholder, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company or the Selling Stockholder.

Indemnification of Underwriters by the Selling Stockholder
     The Selling Stockholder hereunder also agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Wachovia, its affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls Wachovia within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities incurred as a result of Wachovia's participation as a "qualified independent underwriter" within the meaning of the Rules of Conduct of the NASD in connection with the offering of the Shares.

Indemnification of the Company and the Selling Stockholder
 
with the words "The underwriters have advised us that they may make short sales . . ." and "The underwriters have advised us that, pursuant to Regulation M . . .".
     (d) . If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to the preceding paragraphs of this Section 9, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) above. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary or (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be paid or reimbursed as they are incurred; , , that if indemnity may be sought pursuant to the second paragraph of Section 9(a) above in respect of such proceeding, then in addition to such separate firm of the Underwriters, their affiliates and such control persons of the Underwriters the indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of not more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for Wachovia in its capacity as a "qualified independent underwriter," its affiliates and all persons, if any, who control Wachovia within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representatives; any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company and any such separate firm for the Selling Stockholder shall be designated in writing by the Attorneys-in-Fact. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the

subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
     (e) . If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholder, on the one hand, and the Underwriters or Wachovia in its capacity as a "qualified independent underwriter," as the case may be, on the other, from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company and the Selling Stockholder, on the one hand, and the Underwriters or Wachovia in its capacity as a "qualified independent underwriter," as the case may be, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholder, on the one hand, and the Underwriters or Wachovia in its capacity as a "qualified independent underwriter," as the case may be, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Selling Stockholder from the sale of the Shares and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, or the fee to be received by Wachovia in its capacity as a "qualified independent underwriter," as the case may be, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Shares. The relative fault of the Company and the Selling Stockholder, on the one hand, and the Underwriters or Wachovia in its capacity as a "qualified independent underwriter," as the case may be, on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Selling Stockholder or by the Underwriters or Wachovia in its capacity as a "qualified independent underwriter," as the case may be, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution
     (f) . The Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (e) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (e) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Shares exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability

     (g) . The remedies provided for in this Section 9 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies

Effectiveness of Agreement
     11. .

Termination
     12. .
Defaulting Underwriter
     (a) If, on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Shares that it has agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Shares by other persons satisfactory to the Company and the Selling Stockholder on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Shares, then the Company and the Selling Stockholder shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Shares on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company and the Selling Stockholder may postpone the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company, counsel for the Selling Stockholder or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 12, purchases Shares that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company and the Selling Stockholder as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate number of Shares that remain unpurchased on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate number of Shares to be purchased on such date, then the Company and the Selling Stockholder shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Shares that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder on such date plus such Underwriter's pro rata share (based on
 
the number of Shares that such Underwriter agreed to purchase on such date) of the Shares of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
     (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company and the Selling Stockholder as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate number of Shares that remain unpurchased on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate amount of Shares to be purchased on such date, or if the Company and the Selling Stockholder shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement or, with respect to any Additional Closing Date, the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase Shares on the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12 shall be without liability on the part of the Company and the Selling Stockholder, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 13 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 9 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
     (d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company, the Selling Stockholder or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
     13. .
Payment of Expenses
     (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company will pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder, including without limitation, (i) the costs incident to the authorization, issuance, sale, preparation and delivery of the Shares and any taxes payable in that connection; (ii) the costs (other than the fees and expenses of underwriters' counsel related thereto) incident to the preparation, printing and filing under the Securities Act of the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (including all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) and the distribution thereof; (iii) the costs of reproducing and distributing each of the Transaction Documents; (iv) the fees and expenses of the Company's counsel and independent accountants; (v) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the registration or qualification of the Shares under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate (including the related fees and expenses reasonably incurred of counsel for the Underwriters); (vi) the cost of preparing stock certificates; (vii) the costs and charges of any transfer agent and any registrar; (viii) all expenses and application fees incurred in connection with any filing with, and clearance of the offering by, the NASD; (ix) all expenses incurred by the Company in connection with any "road show" presentation to potential investors; and (x) all expenses and application fees related to the listing of the Shares on the Nasdaq Global Market; that notwithstanding clause (ix) above, the Underwriters shall pay one-half of the expenses associated with any airplane, which is used for the purposes of such "road show" presentations.

Persons Entitled to Benefit of Agreement

to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, that the Time of Sale Information, at the Time of Sale (which such counsel may assume to be the date of the Underwriting Agreement) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or that the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto as of its date and the Closing Date contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In making the foregoing statement, such counsel will not express any comment or belief with respect to the financial statements and notes and related schedules (and other financial and accounting data derived therefrom), and the oil and natural gas reserve estimates included in or omitted from the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus.
     In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters of fact on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials that are furnished to the Underwriters.

     (c) No consent, approval, authorization or order of any governmental agency or body under United States federal or Texas state law that in such counsel's experience is normally applicable to limited partnerships in relation to transactions of the type contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement or by the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus is required to be obtained or made by the Selling Stockholder for the execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement or in connection with the sale to the Underwriter of the Shares sold by each Selling Stockholder, except such as have been obtained and such as may be required under federal or state securities laws, as to which such counsel need not express any opinion.

Table of Contents
     On November 7, 2007, Approach Resources Inc. (the "Company"), together with Neo Canyon Exploration, L.P. (the "Selling Stockholder"), entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC, KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. and Tudor, Pickering & Co. Securities, Inc. (collectively, the "Underwriters") providing for the offer and sale in a firm commitment underwritten offering of an aggregate of 7,666,667 shares of the Company's common stock, including 5,605,377 shares issued and sold by the Company and 2,061,290 shares sold by the Selling Stockholder at a price of $12.00 per share ($11.16 per share, net of underwriting discount). In connection with the offering, the Company and the Selling Stockholder granted the Underwriters an option to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,150,000 additional shares at the same price to cover over-allotments.
     In the Underwriting Agreement, the Company agreed to indemnify the Underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933 or to contribute to payments the Underwriters may be required to make because of any of those liabilities.
     A copy of the Underwriting Agreement was filed as Exhibit 1.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 13, 2007 and is incorporated herein by reference.
     The description of the Contribution Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement described below under Item 2.01 is incorporated in this Item 1.01 by reference.
     As described in the final prospectus dated November 7, 2007 and filed on November 8, 2007 with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Prospectus") of the Company, immediately before the closing of the Company's initial public offering on November 14, 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Approach Oil & Gas Inc. and acquired the 30% working interest in the Ozona Northeast field that the Company did not already own from Neo Canyon Exploration, L.P. (the "Neo Canyon Interest"), pursuant to the contribution agreement by and among the Company, Approach Oil & Gas Inc., Neo Canyon Exploration, L.P, the stockholders of Approach Oil & Gas Inc., the general partner of Neo Canyon Exploration, L.P., Lubar Equity Fund, LLC and Yorktown Energy Partners VII, L.P., dated June 29, 2007 (the "Contribution Agreement"). Upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement, Neo Canyon Exploration, L.P. and each of the stockholders of Approach Oil & Gas Inc. received shares of the Company's common stock in exchange for their respective contributions. Neo Canyon Exploration, L.P. received an aggregate of 4,239,243 shares of the Company's common stock, of which 2,061,290 shares were offered in the initial public offering, 156,805 shares were subject to the over-allotment option granted to the Underwriters and 2,021,148 shares were redeemed by the Company. The stockholders of Approach Oil & Gas Inc. received an aggregate of 989,157 shares of the Company's common stock.
     The Company determined the purchase price for the Approach Oil & Gas Inc. and Neo Canyon Exploration, L.P. contributions based on a formula that compared the discounted future net cash flows attributable to their contributions with the discounted future net cash flows of the combined oil and gas reserves of the Company, Approach Oil & Gas Inc. and the Neo Canyon Interest. The Company's management made such comparison using January 1, 2007 reserve data priced using forward strip gas prices at March 31, 2007. Based on this comparison, the Company determined the number of shares to be issued to Approach Oil & Gas Inc. and Neo Canyon Exploration, L.P. in exchange for the contributions made by them pursuant to the Contribution Agreement.
     Each of Yorktown Energy Partners V, L.P. and Yorktown Energy Partners VI, L.P. were stockholders of Approach Oil & Gas Inc. prior to the completion of the Company's initial public offering. Yorktown Energy Partners V, L.P. was a majority stockholder of the Company prior to the completion of the Company's initial public offering. Yorktown Energy Partners V, L.P., Yorktown Energy Partners VI, L.P. and Yorktown Energy Partners VII, L.P. are affiliated funds and each is affiliated with Bryan H. Lawrence, who serves as the chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company. Lubar Equity Fund, LLC is an affiliate of Sheldon B. Lubar, who serves as a member of the Company's Board of Directors.
Table of Contents
     A copy of the Contribution Agreement was filed as Exhibit 10.2 to the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-1 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 12, 2007 and is incorporated herein by reference.
     As described in the Prospectus, in connection with the Contribution Agreement and certain other transactions, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement, dated November 14, 2007 with the parties to the Contribution Agreement and the other investors party thereto (the "Registration Rights Agreement") under which such parties have certain demand and piggyback registration rights for the shares of the Company's common stock that they own following the closing of the offering. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, each of Yorktown Energy Partners V, L.P., Yorktown Energy Partners VI, L.P. and Yorktown Energy Partners VII, L.P. and the members of the Company's management team have the right to require the Company to file a registration statement for the public sale of all of the shares of common stock owned by it or them any time after six months following the effective date of the registration statement of which the Prospectus formed. In addition, if the Company sells any shares of its common stock in a registered underwritten offering, each of its pre-offering stockholders has the right to include his or its shares in that offering. The underwriters of any such offering have the right to limit the number of shares to be included in such sale. The Registration Rights Agreement also provides that the Company will pay the costs and expenses, other than underwriting or brokers' discounts and commissions, related to the registration and sale of shares by these parties that are registered pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. The Registration Rights Agreement contains customary registration procedures and indemnification and contribution provisions for the benefit of these parties and the Company.
     A copy of the Registration Rights Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K/A and is incorporated herein by reference.
     In connection with the closing of the Contribution Agreement described in Item 2.01 above, the Company issued an aggregate of 5,228,400 shares of common stock on November 14, 2007 in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to the exemption provided in Section 4(2) thereunder. Such shares were issued in exchange for the capital stock of Approach Oil & Gas Inc. and the 30% working interest of Neo Canyon Exploration, L.P. in the Ozona Northeast field that the Company did not already own.
     On June 25, 2007, Yorktown Energy Partners VII, L.P. and Lubar Equity Fund, LLC loaned an aggregate of $20,000,000 to Approach Oil & Gas Inc. under two convertible promissory notes of $10,000,000 each, which notes bore interest at a rate of 7.00% per annum and had a maturity date of June 25, 2010. These notes were convertible at the election of the lender into shares of equity securities of Approach Oil & Gas Inc. at $100 per share on December 31, 2007, or earlier if the Company sold substantially all of the assets of Approach Oil & Gas Inc. or completed an initial public offering.

     (i) Subject to any notice by the Company in accordance with this Section 6(b) of the existence of any fact or event of the kind described in Section 6(d)(vi), use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective during the Effectiveness Period; upon the occurrence of any event that would cause the Shelf Registration Statement or the Prospectus contained therein (A) to contain a material misstatement or omission or (B) not to be effective and usable for resale of the Registrable Securities covered thereby during the Effectiveness Period, the Company shall file promptly an appropriate amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement, a supplement to the Prospectus or a report filed with the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15 (d) of the Exchange Act, in the case of clause (A) of this Section 6(b)(i), correcting any such misstatement or omission, and, in the case of either clause (A) or (B) of this Section 6(b)(i), use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such amendment to be declared effective and the Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus to become usable for their intended purposes as soon as practicable thereafter.

     (B) if a majority of the Company's board of directors, in good faith, determines that the Company is required by law, rule or regulation to supplement the Shelf Registration Statement or file a post-effective amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement in order to incorporate information into the Shelf Registration Statement for the purpose of (1) including in the Shelf Registration Statement any Prospectus required under Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act, (2) reflecting in the Prospectus included in the Shelf Registration Statement any facts or events arising after the effective date of the Shelf Registration Statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment) that, individually or in the aggregate, represents a fundamental change in the information set forth in the Prospectus, or (3) including in the Prospectus included in the Shelf Registration Statement any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not disclosed in the Shelf Registration Statement or any material change to such information.
Upon the occurrence of any event described in clauses (A) and (B) of this Section 6(b)(ii), the Company shall give notice to each Demanding Qualified Holder with respect to such Shelf Registration Statement that the availability of the Shelf Registration is suspended and, upon actual receipt of any such notice, each such Demanding Qualified Holder agrees not to sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement until such Demanding Qualified Holder's receipt of copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus provided for this Section 6(b). The Suspension Period shall not exceed 60 days in any 90-day period (except as a result of a review of any post-effective amendment by the SEC prior to declaring any post-effective amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement effective provided the Company has used its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such post-effective amendment to be declared effective); provided, that Suspension Periods shall not exceed an aggregate of 120 days in any 12-month period. The Company shall not be required to specify in the written notice to the Qualified Holders the nature of the event giving rise to the Suspension Period.

or any other Federal or state governmental authority for amendments or supplements to a Registration Statement or related Prospectus or for additional information, (iii) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (iv) if at any time the representations and warranties of the Company contained in any agreement (including any underwriting agreement) contemplated by below cease to be true and correct, (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose and (vi) of the happening of any event that makes any statement made in such Registration Statement or related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect or that requires the making of any changes in such Registration Statement, Prospectus or documents so that, in the case of the Registration Statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, not misleading, and that, in the case of the Prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

          (j) Cooperate with the selling holders of Registrable Securities and the managing underwriters, if any, to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates (not bearing any legends) representing Registrable Securities to be sold after receiving written representations from each holder of such Registrable Securities that the Registrable Securities represented by the certificates so delivered by such holder will be transferred in accordance with the Registration Statement, and enable such Registrable Securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as the managing underwriters, if any, or holders may request at least two (2) business days prior to any sale of Registrable Securities in a firm commitment public offering, but in any other such sale, within ten (10) business days prior to having to issue the securities.
          (k) Use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities within the United States, except as may be required solely as a consequence of the nature of such selling holder's business, in which case the Company will cooperate in all reasonable respects with the filing of such Registration Statement and the granting of such approvals, as may be necessary to enable the seller or sellers thereof or the underwriters, if any, to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities.
          (l) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by above, prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the Registrable Securities being sold thereunder, such Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

Prospectus and agrees to indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, severally and not jointly, the Company, its directors, officers, accountants, attorneys, agents and employees, each Person who controls the Company (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act), and the directors, officers, partners, members, managers, stockholders, accountants, attorneys, agents or employees of such controlling persons, and each underwriter, if any, and each person who controls such underwriter (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act), from and against all Losses arising out of or based on any untrue statement of a material fact contained in any such Registration Statement, Prospectus, Prospectus supplement, offering circular, or other document, or any omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse the Company and such directors, officers, partners, members, managers, stockholders, accountants, attorneys, employees, agents, persons, underwriters, or control persons for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability, or action, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or omission is made in such Registration Statement, Prospectus, Prospectus supplement, offering circular, or other document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such holder specifically for use in connection with the preparation of such Registration Statement, Prospectus, Prospectus supplement, offering circular or other document; provided, however, that the obligations of such holder hereunder shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such claims, losses, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) if such settlement is effected without the consent of such holder (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); and provided, further, that the liability of each selling holder of Registrable Securities hereunder shall be limited to the net proceeds received by such selling holder from the sale of Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement. In addition, insofar as the foregoing indemnity relates to any such untrue statement or omission made in the preliminary Prospectus but eliminated or remedied in the amended Prospectus on file with the SEC at the time the Registration Statement becomes effective or in the final Prospectus filed pursuant to applicable rules of the SEC or in any supplement or addendum thereto and such new Prospectus is delivered to the underwriter, the indemnity agreement herein shall not inure to the benefit of such underwriter, any controlling person of such underwriter and their respective Representatives, if a copy of the final Prospectus filed pursuant to such rules, together with all supplements and addenda thereto was not furnished to the Person asserting the loss, liability, claim or damage at or prior to the time such furnishing is required by the Securities Act.

If any Person shall be entitled to indemnity hereunder (an ""), such indemnified party shall give prompt notice to the party from which such indemnity is sought (the "") of any claim or of the commencement of any Proceeding with respect to which such indemnified party seeks indemnification or contribution pursuant hereto; provided, however, that the delay or failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any obligation or liability except to the extent that the indemnifying party has been prejudiced by such delay or failure. The indemnifying party shall have the right, exercisable by giving written notice to an indemnified party promptly after the receipt of written notice from such indemnified party of such claim or Proceeding, to, unless in the indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist in respect of such claim, assume, at the indemnifying party's expense, the defense of any such claim or Proceeding, with

counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that an indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such claim or Proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless: (i) the indemnifying party agrees to pay such fees and expenses or (ii) the indemnifying party fails promptly to assume the defense of such claim or Proceeding or fails to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; in which case the indemnified party shall have the right to employ counsel and to assume the defense of such claim or proceeding; provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such claim or Proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related claims or Proceedings in the same jurisdiction, arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for all of the indemnified parties, or for fees and expenses that are not reasonable. Whether or not such defense is assumed by the indemnifying party, such indemnified party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its consent (but such consent will not be unreasonably withheld). The indemnifying party shall not consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation for which such indemnified party would be entitled to indemnification hereunder.
          (d) . If the indemnification provided for in this is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any Losses (other than in accordance with its terms), then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and indemnified party, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been taken by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent any such action, statement or omission.
Contribution

     The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.

No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

Rule 144

The decrease in revenues, EBITDAX and production were the result of (1) the natural decline in production of the tight gas Canyon sands in our Ozona Northeast field and (2) the reduction in drilling rigs from four in the second half of 2005 and first half of 2006 to one rig in late 2006 and the first half of 2007.

Realized gain on commodity derivatives increased our net income for the third quarter by $1.1 million. At September 30, 2007, the Company had fixed price swaps in place for 2007 of 230,000 MMBtu per month at $9.22 per MMBtu. In addition, at September 30, 2007, the Company had costless collars in place for 2008 of 186,000 MMBtu per month at $7.50  $11.45 per MMBtu. In November 2007, the Company added costless collars for 2009 of 180,000 MMBtu per month at $7.50  $10.50 per MMBtu.
Lease operating expenses for the third quarter of 2007 were $760,000 or $0.62 per Mcfe, compared to $822,000 or $0.52 per Mcfe for the third quarter of 2006. Severance and production taxes for the third quarter of 2007 were $400,000 or $0.32 per Mcfe, compared to $540,000 or $0.34 per Mcfe for the prior year period. Severance and production taxes decreased as a result of reduced oil and gas sales in 2007. Depletion, depreciation and amortization ("DD&A") expense for the third quarter of 2007 was $3.1 million or $2.52 per Mcfe, compared to $3.8 million or $2.41 per Mcfe for the third quarter of 2006. The decrease in DD&A expense was primarily attributable to decreased production, which was slightly offset by an increase in DD&A per Mcfe due to increased capitalized costs incurred primarily from our continued development of the Ozona Northeast field. The Company recorded no dry hole costs for the third quarter of 2007, compared to $572,000 for the third quarter of 2006. General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2007 were $1.4 million or $1.12 per Mcfe, compared to $500,000 or $0.32 per Mcfe for the prior year period in 2006. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of bonus payments made in the third quarter of 2007 after the filing of the Company's initial registration statement and increased staffing costs in 2007.
 
 
Through the end of the third quarter of 2007, the Company had drilled a total of 44 wells (28.7 net), 33 (22.5 net) of which had been completed as producers, 10 (6.1 net) of which were in various stages of completion and one (0.7 net) of which was abandoned. Of the 44 wells drilled, 40 were development and four were exploratory. Since July 2007, the Company has kept three rigs running full time, one each in Ozona Northeast, Cinco Terry and North Bald Prairie.
Development Drilling Projects
West Texas  Ozona Northeast (Canyon Sands)
During the third quarter of 2007, the Company drilled 12 (8.4 net) Canyon development wells with a 100% success rate. Of the 12 Canyon wells, nine (6.3 net) had been completed as producers with the remaining three (2.1 net) in various stages of completion as of the end of the quarter.
During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company expects to drill an additional 12 (9.9 net) Canyon wells. For the year, the Company expects to drill 45 Canyon wells in Ozona Northeast.
In November 2007, the Company drilled and abandoned two wells. One well was a step-out designed to test a southwestern channel sequence. This well encountered 48 feet of gross Canyon sand but only had six feet of porosity. The Company expects this abandoned well to negatively impact only three currently identified locations in Ozona Northeast. The second well, a western step-out, encountered 45 feet of gross Canyon sand but only had six feet of porosity. The Company does not expect this abandoned well to negatively impact any currently identified drilling locations.
The Company plans to drill up to 40 new Canyon wells in Ozona Northeast in 2008. Since February of 2004, the Company has drilled 291 gross wells in Ozona Northeast with a 96% success rate. In addition, the Company has identified over 600 additional drilling locations in Ozona Northeast.
West Texas  Cinco Terry (Wolfcamp, Canyon Sands and Ellenburger)
During the third quarter of 2007, the Company drilled five (2.5 net) Canyon development wells and one (0.5 net) Ellenburger development well with a 100% success rate. Of the six total wells, three (1.5 net) had been completed as producers (two Canyon and one Ellenburger) with the remaining three (1.5 net) in various stages of completion as of the end of the quarter.
The Ellenburger well that was completed in the third quarter of 2007 came on line at 1.1 MMcf/d and 59 Bbls/d (gross) at 2100 psig on a 10/64 choke. This well currently is producing 1.1 MMcf/d and 49 Bbls/d (gross) at 2100 psig on a 10/64 choke. Since September 30, 2007, the Company has drilled three (1.5 net) other Ellenburger wells, which currently are in various stages of completion or waiting on a pipeline connection.
 
During November 2007, the Company drilled and abandoned two wells in Cinco Terry. The first well, a one-mile, northeast step-out from a Wolfcamp test well, encountered 52 feet of gross Canyon sand but had insufficient porosity. The Company does not expect this abandoned well to negatively impact any currently identified drilling locations. In addition, the Company abandoned the surface hole on one well due to mechanical problems. The Company has since redrilled this well and found what the Company expects will be productive Ellenburger and Canyon formations.
In late November 2007, the Company entered into a gas gathering, processing and sales agreement that will allow the Company to produce and sell 100% of its gas from Cinco Terry. The new agreement will increase the Company's percentage of proceeds ("POP") from 85% to 88% with fixed recoveries, shrinkage and fuel. In addition, the agreement will increase the POP to 90% once the Company delivers 1.46 Bcf of gas to the system. The agreement also allows gas out of Cinco Terry to be sold on the WAHA index. Previously, this gas was sold on the less favorable El Paso index.
The Company plans to drill up to 23 (11.5 net) Canyon/Ellenburger wells and one horizontal Wolfcamp shale test well in Cinco Terry in 2008. The Company has identified over 120 drilling locations in Cinco Terry.
East Texas  North Bald Prairie (Cotton Valley Sands, Bossier and Cotton Valley Lime)
During the third quarter of 2007, the Company drilled one (0.5 net) Cotton Valley/Bossier sand development well in the North Bald Prairie prospect. The Company has since drilled three (1.5 net) new Cotton Valley/Bossier wells for a total of four (two net) wells drilled in North Bald Prairie. All four wells are in various stages of completion or post-stimulation clean up. In addition, the Company plans to spud a fifth well by the end of next week. In October 2007, the Company began construction of a six-inch gathering system for the North Bald Prairie field. The Company completed construction of the system in late November 2007.
The Company plans to drill up to 12 (six net) Cotton Valley/Bossier sand wells in North Bald Prairie in 2008. The Company has identified over 60 drilling locations in North Bald Prairie.
Exploratory Drilling Prospects
British Columbia (Triassic Tight Gas and Shale)
During the third quarter of 2007, the Company participated in one (0.25 net) Montney sand development well. This well currently is waiting on a pipeline connection. During the first quarter of 2008, the Company expects to participate in one (0.25 net) horizontal Montney well and one (0.25 net) vertical Doig shale well. The Company expects to participate in up to two (0.50 net) additional Montney tight gas and Doig shale wells in 2008, for a total of four (one net) wells in 2008.
Western Kentucky  Boomerang Prospect (New Albany Shale)
At the end of the third quarter, the Company had three (1.8 net) vertical New Albany shale wells waiting on completion. The first well encountered gas shows and fracturing in the upper New Albany shale. The second well encountered gas shows and fracturing throughout the entire New Albany shale package. The third well encountered gas shows in the upper New Albany shale.
 
The Company expects to drill up to three (1.8 net) horizontal New Albany shale test wells in 2008. The first horizontal well should spud in the first quarter of 2008. The Company also plans on completing two of the three vertical wells that it has drilled. The Company will wait on additional results from these wells before making a decision on whether to complete the third well.
Northern New Mexico  El Vado East (Mancos Shale Oil)
The Company expects to drill up to eight (7.2 net) exploratory Mancos shale test wells in 2008.
Ross Craft, Approach's President and CEO, commented, "Positive cash flow from our legacy asset, Ozona Northeast, will remain instrumental in funding our development drilling projects for the remainder of 2007 and 2008. We continue to be pleased with the progress of our Cinco Terry and North Bald Prairie projects. In addition, we are encouraged by the opportunities in our three unconventional resource plays in British Columbia, Kentucky and New Mexico. Based on our mixture of low risk development drilling projects and exploratory acreage, we feel confident about the Company's plan for 2008 and beyond."
Initial Public Offering and Ozona Northeast Working Interest Acquisition
On November 14, 2007, the Company completed its initial public offering ("IPO") of common stock at $12.00 per share. In the IPO, including the over-allotment option exercised by the underwriters, the Company registered the offer and sale of 8,816,667 shares of common stock as set forth below:
Gross proceeds of the IPO, including the over-allotment option, were approximately $81.1 million. Net proceeds to the Company, after deducting underwriter discounts, were approximately $73.6 million. The Company used net proceeds to (1) repay $51.1 million on the Company's revolving credit facility and (2) repurchase 2,021,148 shares of common stock from the selling shareholder at the IPO price of $12.00 per share less underwriter discounts.
In connection with the IPO, we also acquired the 30% working interest in Ozona Northeast that we did not already own from the selling shareholder, in exchange for 4,239,243 shares of common stock.
2008 Budget
The Company's Board of Directors recently approved a 2008 exploration and development budget of $64.3 million, which consists of $54.8 million committed to the Company's three core operating areas in Ozona Northeast, Cinco Terry and North Bald Prairie. The remaining $9.5 million is allocated to the Company's exploration prospects in Western Canada, Kentucky and New Mexico. The Company expects no proved reserves to be booked to its exploration projects at January 1, 2008. Of the $64.3 million budgeted for 2008, 95% will be spent on properties operated by the Company.

Supplemental non-GAAP financial measure
EBITDAX (as defined below) is presented herein, and reconciled to the generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund development and exploration activities.
We define EBITDAX as net income, plus (1) exploration and abandonments expense, (2) depletion, depreciation and amortization expense, (3) stock-based compensation expense, (4) change in fair value of commodity derivatives, (5) interest expense and (6) income taxes. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flow as determined by GAAP.
Our EBITDAX measure provides additional information that may be used to better understand our operations. EBITDAX is one of several metrics that we use as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income, as an indicator of our operating performance. Certain items excluded from EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost of depreciable assets, none of which are components of EBITDAX. EBITDAX as used by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We believe that EBITDAX is a widely followed measure of operating performance and is one of many metrics used by our management team and by other readers of the Company's consolidated financial statements. For example, EBITDAX can be used to assess our operating performance and return on capital in comparison to other independent exploration and production companies without regard to financial or capital structure, and to assess the financial performance of our assets and our company without regard to capital structure or historical cost basis.
The following table provides a reconciliation of net income to EBITDAX (in thousands):

Item 1.01    Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On January 18, 2008, Approach Resources Inc. (the "Company," "we," "us" or "our") entered into a $200 million Credit Agreement (the "New Credit Agreement") with The Frost National Bank as administrative agent and lender ("Frost" or the "Agent"), and the financial institutions named therein. The New Credit Agreement supersedes and terminates the $100 million Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated February 15, 2007 by and among Approach Resources I, L.P., as borrower, Frost, as administrative agent and lender, and the financial institutions named therein (the "Prior Credit Agreement").
     Borrowings under the New Credit Agreement are subject to a borrowing base that is initially set at $75 million. Loans made under the New Credit Agreement mature July 31, 2010. The New Credit Agreement provides for interest on outstanding amounts to accrue at a rate calculated, at our option, at either (i) the base rate, which is Frost's prime rate, or (ii) the sum of the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus a margin that ranges from 1.25% to 2.0% per annum. In addition, we pay an annual commitment fee of 0.375% of non-utilized borrowings available under the New Credit Agreement.
     The borrowing base under the New Credit Agreement will be re-determined every six months or, upon the election by the Company or the lenders, one additional time each calendar year. On or before March 1 and September 1 of each year, we are required to furnish to the lenders an engineering report evaluating the oil and gas properties of the Company and its subsidiaries as of the preceding January 1 and July 1. The reserve report as of January 1 of each year must be prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton or another independent petroleum engineering firm acceptable to the Agent.
     Under the New Credit Agreement, we are subject to a financial covenant requiring maintenance of a minimum modified ratio of current assets to current liabilities of at least one to one. In addition, the New Credit Agreement contains financial covenants restricting cash dividends and other restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, incurrence of other debt, consolidations and mergers, the level of operating leases, asset sales, investment in other entities and liens on properties. Loans under the New Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of our oil and gas properties. In addition, in connection with the New Credit Agreement, our wholly-owned subsidiaries Approach Oil & Gas Inc., Approach Resources I, L.P. and Approach Oil & Gas (Canada) Inc. entered into Guaranty Agreements in favor of the lenders. Under the Guaranty Agreements, each of these subsidiaries guaranteed the prompt and full payment of indebtedness under the New Credit Agreement.
     We expect that borrowings under the New Credit Agreement may be used to finance our working capital needs and for general corporate purposes, including the exploration, acquisition and development of oil and gas properties.
     The foregoing description of the New Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the agreement. A copy of the New Credit Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 1.02    Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement
     In connection with the execution of the New Credit Agreement on January 18, 2008, the Prior Credit Agreement was terminated as of that date. At the time of termination, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Prior Credit Agreement.
 
Item 2.03    Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation
     The information set forth above under Item 1.01 and Item 1.02 is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01    Financial Statements and Exhibits.

Interest Rates.
     (a) .
Options
     (i) . On all Base Rate Loans Borrower agrees to pay interest on the Notes calculated on the basis of a year consisting of 365 days or 366 days in a leap year, as the case may be, and for the actual number of days elapsed. with respect to the unpaid principal amount of each Base Rate Loan from the date the proceeds thereof are made available to Borrower until maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise), at a varying rate per annum equal to the lesser of (i) the Maximum Rate, or (ii) the Base Rate the Applicable Rate. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement as to prepayment, the principal of the Notes representing Base Rate Loans shall be payable as specified in Section 3(e) hereof and the interest in respect of each Base Rate Loan shall be payable on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto. Past due principal and, to the extent permitted by law, past due interest in respect to each Base Rate Loan, shall bear interest, payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate.
Base Rate Loans
plus
     (ii) . On all Eurodollar Loans Borrower agrees to pay interest calculated on the basis of a year consisting of 365 days or 366 days in a leap year, as the case may be, and for the actual number of days elapsed. with respect to the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Loan from the date the proceeds thereof are made available to Borrower until maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise), at a varying rate per annum equal to the lesser of (i) the Maximum Rate, or (ii) the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Rate. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement with respect to prepayment, the principal of the Notes shall be payable as specified in Section 3(e) hereof and the interest with respect to each Eurodollar Loan shall be payable on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto. Past due principal and, to the extent permitted by law, past due interest shall bear interest, payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate. Upon three (3) Business Days' written notice prior to the making by Lenders of any Eurodollar Loan (in the case of the initial Interest Period therefor) or the expiration date of each succeeding Interest Period (in the case of subsequent Interest Periods therefor), Borrower shall have the option,
Eurodollar Loans
 
subject to compliance by Borrower with all of the provisions of this Agreement, as long as no Event of Default exists, to specify whether the Interest Period commencing on any such date shall be a one (1), two (2), three (3) or six (6) month period, subject to availability. If Agent shall not have received timely notice of a designation of such Interest Period as herein provided, Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to convert all then maturing Eurodollar Loans to Base Rate Loans.
     (b) . Agent shall determine each interest rate applicable to the Loans hereunder. Agent shall give prompt written notice to Borrower and Lenders of each rate of interest so determined and its determination thereof shall be conclusive absent error.
Interest Rate Determination
     (c) . Borrower may elect from time to time (i) to convert all or any part of its Eurodollar Loans to Base Rate Loans by giving Agent irrevocable notice of such election in writing prior to 10:00 a.m. (Fort Worth, Texas time) on the conversion date and such conversion shall be made on the requested conversion date, provided that any such conversion of a Eurodollar Loan shall only be made on the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto, and (ii) to convert all or any part of its Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans by giving Agent irrevocable written notice of such election no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed conversion and such conversion shall be made on the requested conversion date or, if such requested conversion date is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day. Any such conversion shall not be deemed to be a prepayment of any of the loans for purposes of this Agreement or the Notes.
Conversion Option
     (d) . If at any time the applicable rate of interest selected pursuant to Sections 4(a)(i) or 4(a)(ii) above shall exceed the Maximum Rate, thereby causing the interest on the Notes to be limited to the Maximum Rate, then any subsequent reduction in the interest rate so selected or subsequently selected shall not reduce the rate of interest on the Notes below the Maximum Rate until the total amount of interest accrued on the Notes equals the amount of interest which would have accrued on the Notes if the rate or rates selected pursuant to Sections 4(a)(i) or (ii), as the case may be, had at all times been in effect.
Recoupment
     (e) . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 4, during the continuance of an Event of Default the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice from Agent to Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding the provisions of Section 15 hereof, which requires all Lenders to consent to changes in interest rates) declare that no Advance may be made as, converted into, or continued as a Eurodollar Loan. During the continuance of an Event of Default, the Required Lenders, may, at their option, by notice from Agent to Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the option of Required Lenders notwithstanding the provisions of Section 15 hereof, which requires all Lenders to consent to changes in interest rates) declare that (i) each Eurodollar Loan shall bear interest for the remainder of the applicable Interest Period at the rate otherwise applicable to such Interest Period plus two percent (2%) per annum and
Interest Rates Applicable After Default
 
(ii) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest at the rate otherwise applicable to such Base Rate Loan plus two percent (2%), provided that, during the continuance of an Event of Default under Section 14(g) or 14(h), the interest rate set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above (the "Default Rate") shall be applicable to all outstanding Loans without any election or action on the part of Agent or any Lender.
     5. 
Special Provisions Relating to Loans.
     (a) . In the event that, in connection with any proposed Eurodollar Loan, Agent reasonably determines, which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties, due to changes in circumstances since the date hereof, adequate and fair means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate or such rate will not accurately reflect the costs to Lenders of funding a Eurodollar Loan for such Interest Period, Agent shall give notice of such determination to Borrower and Lenders, whereupon, until Agent notifies Borrower and Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligations of Lenders to make, continue or convert Loans into Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended, and all Loans to Borrower shall be Base Rate Loans during the period of suspension.
Unavailability of Funds or Inadequacy of Pricing
     (b) . If at any time hereafter any new law or any change in existing laws or in the interpretation of any new or existing laws shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or continue to maintain or fund Eurodollar Loans hereunder, then such Lender shall promptly notify Borrower in writing and such Lender's obligation to make, continue or convert Loans into Eurodollar Loans under this Agreement shall be suspended until it is no longer unlawful for such Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans. Upon receipt of such notice, Borrower shall either repay the outstanding Eurodollar Loans owed to such Lender, without penalty, on the last day of the current Interest Periods (or, if any Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Eurodollar Loans, immediately), or Borrower may convert such Eurodollar Loans at such appropriate time to Base Rate Loans.
Change in Laws
     (c) .
Increased Cost or Reduced Return
     (i) If, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule, or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule, or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank, or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such governmental authority, central bank, or comparable agency:
     (A) shall subject such Lender to any tax, duty, or other charge with respect to any Eurodollar Loans, its Notes, or its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans, or change the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to such
 
Lender under this Agreement or its Notes in respect of any Eurodollar Loan (other than franchise taxes and taxes imposed on or measured by the overall net income of such Lender);
     (B) shall impose, modify, or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, assessment, or similar requirement (other than reserve requirements, if any, taken into account in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate) relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities or commitments of, such Lender, including the Commitment of such Lender hereunder; or
     (C) shall impose on such Lender or on the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or its Notes or any of such extensions of credit or liabilities or commitments;
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting into, continuing, or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan or to reduce any sum received or receivable by such Lender under this Agreement or its Notes with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, then Borrower shall pay to such Lender on demand such amount or amounts as will reasonably compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction. If any Lender requests compensation by Borrower under this Section 5(c)(i), Borrower may, by notice to such Lender (with a copy to Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Loans, or to convert all or part of the Base Rate Loans owing to such Lender to Eurodollar Loans, until the event or condition giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 5(c)(i) shall be applicable); provided that such suspension shall not affect the right of such Lender to receive the compensation so requested.
     (ii) If, after the date hereof, any Lender shall have reasonably determined that the adoption of any applicable law, rule, or regulation regarding capital adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank, or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such governmental authority, central bank, or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender's obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change, request, or directive (taking into
 
consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time upon demand Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will reasonably compensate such Lender for such reduction. If any Lender requests compensation by Borrower under this Section 5(c)(ii), Borrower may, by notice to such Lender (with a copy to Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Loans, or to convert all or part of the Base Rate Loans owing to such Lender to Eurodollar Loans, until the event or condition giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 5(c)(ii) shall be applicable); provided that such suspension shall not affect the right of such Lender to receive the compensation so requested.
     (iii) Each Lender shall promptly notify Borrower and Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section 5(c) and will designate a separate lending office, if applicable, if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to it. Any Lender claiming compensation under this Section 5(c) shall furnish to Borrower and Agent a statement setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder which shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.
     (iv) Any Lender giving notice to Borrower through Agent pursuant to this Section 5(c) shall give to Borrower a statement signed by an officer of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for, and the calculation of such additional cost, reduced payments or capital requirements, as the case may be, and the additional amounts required to compensate such Lender therefor.
     (v) Within five (5) Business Days after receipt by Borrower of any notice referred to in this Section 5(c), Borrower shall pay to Agent for the account of Lender issuing such notice such additional amounts as are required to compensate such Lender for the increased cost, reduced payments or increased capital requirements identified therein, as the case may be.
     (vi) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of any such Lender's right to demand such compensation.
     (d) . Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, each Lender shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of its Loan in any manner it sees fit, it being understood, however, that for the purposes of this Agreement all determinations
Discretion of Lender as to Manner of Funding
 
hereunder shall be made as if each Lender had actually funded and maintained each Eurodollar Loan through the purchase of deposits having a maturity corresponding to the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Loan and bearing an interest rate at the applicable interest rate for such Interest Period.
     (e) . Without duplication under any other provision hereof, if any Lender incurs any loss, cost or expense including, without limitation, any loss of profit and loss, cost, expense or premium reasonably incurred by reason of the liquidation or re-employment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund or maintain any Eurodollar Loan or the relending or reinvesting of such deposits or amounts paid or prepaid to Lenders as a result of any of the following events other than any such occurrence as a result in the change of circumstances described in Sections 5(a) and (b):
Breakage Fees
     (i) any payment, prepayment or conversion of a Eurodollar Loan on a date other than the last day of its Interest Period (whether by acceleration, prepayment or otherwise);
     (ii) any failure to make a principal payment of a Eurodollar Loan on the due date thereof; or
     (iii) any failure by Borrower to borrow, continue, prepay or convert to a Eurodollar Loan on the dates specified in a notice given pursuant to Section 2(b) or 4(c) hereof;
then Borrower shall pay to such Lender such amount as will reimburse such Lender for such loss, cost or expense. If any Lender makes such a claim for compensation, it shall furnish to Borrower and Agent a statement setting forth the amount of such loss, cost or expense in reasonable detail (including an explanation of the basis for and the computation of such loss, cost or expense) and the amounts shown on such statement shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error.
     6. .
Collateral Security
     (a) To secure performance by Borrower of its obligations under this Agreement and the Notes, Borrower and Guarantors shall grant to Agent in its capacity as such Agent under this Agreement for the ratable benefit of Lenders hereunder, a first priority security interest in and Lien (and only Lien, except for Permitted Liens) on certain of the Oil and Gas Properties of Borrower and Guarantors as may be selected by Agent, in its capacity as such Agent under this Agreement, and the oil, gas and mineral production therefrom or attributable thereto, and in all operating agreements and oil or gas purchase contracts (now existing or hereafter arising) relating to such Oil and Gas Properties and in related personal properties, fixtures and other properties, as evidenced by mortgages, deeds of trust, assignments of production, security agreements, general security agreements, indentures, and other documents to be executed by Borrower and Guarantors and delivered to or on behalf of Agent, in its capacity as such Agent under this Agreement for the ratable benefit of Lenders. Obligations arising from agreements arising from Rate Management Transactions between Borrower and one or more of Lenders or
 
an Affiliate of any of Lenders shall be secured by the Collateral covering the Oil and Gas Properties on a pari passu basis with the indebtedness and obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents. Once agreements arising from Rate Management Transactions involving one or more Lenders, or an Affiliate of any Lender, are entered into, and pursuant to this provision become secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis, said Collateral shall continue to secure such obligations until such agreements are no longer in force and effect irrespective of whether Lender involved in such agreement ceases to be a Lender under this Agreement. All Oil and Gas Properties and other collateral in which Borrower and Guarantors grant or hereafter grant to Agent for the ratable benefit of Lenders, a first and prior Lien (to the satisfaction of Agent) in accordance with this Section 6, as such properties and interests are from time to time constituted, are hereinafter collectively called the "Collateral".
     (b) The granting and assigning of such security interests and Liens by Borrower and Guarantors shall be pursuant to Collateral Documents in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Agent. Concurrently with the delivery of each of the Collateral Documents or within a reasonable time thereafter, Borrower and Guarantors shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to Agent mortgage and title opinions and other title information reasonably satisfactory to Agent with respect to the title and Lien status of Borrower's and Guarantors' interests in not less than 75% of the Engineered Value of the mortgaged Borrowing Base Properties. "Engineered Value" for this purpose shall mean future net revenues discounted at the discount rate being used by Agent as of the date of any such determination utilizing the pricing parameters used in the engineering report furnished to Agent pursuant to Sections 7 and 12 hereof. Borrower will cause to be executed and delivered to Agent, in the future, additional Collateral Documents if Agent reasonably deems such are necessary to insure perfection or maintenance of Lenders' security interests and Liens in not less than 80% of the Engineered Value of the Oil and Gas Properties which are included in the Borrowing Base then in effect.
     (c) Guarantors shall unconditionally guarantee the Notes pursuant to a guaranty agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Agent.
     7. 
Borrowing Base.
     (a) . At the Effective Date, the Borrowing Base shall be $75,000,000.
Initial Borrowing Base
     (b) . Subsequent determinations of the Borrowing Base shall be made by Lenders semi-annually on or before April 1 and October 1 of each year beginning April 1, 2008 (each "Redetermination Date") or as Unscheduled Redeterminations. No later than March 1 of each year (for the April 1 Redetermination Date of such year) Borrower shall furnish to Lenders an engineering report in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Agent prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton or such other independent petroleum engineering firm acceptable to Agent, said engineering report to utilize economic and pricing parameters used by Agent as established from time to time, together with such other information, reports and data concerning the value of Borrowing Base Properties as Agent shall deem reasonably
Subsequent Determinations of Borrowing Base
 
necessary to determine the value of such Borrowing Base Properties. The engineering report prepared for the April 1 Redetermination Date shall be prepared as of the preceding January 1 of such year and the engineering report prepared for the October 1 Redetermination Date shall be prepared as of July 1 of such year. In addition to the scheduled semi-annual Borrowing Base Redeterminations, Borrower and Lenders may each request one Unscheduled Redetermination between Redetermination Dates. By September 1 of each year (for the October 1 Redetermination Date for such year) beginning September 1, 2008, or within thirty (30) days after either (i) receipt of notice from Agent that Lenders require an Unscheduled Redetermination, or (ii) Borrower gives notice to Agent of its desire to have an Unscheduled Redetermination performed, in each case Borrower shall furnish to Lenders an engineering report prepared by a petroleum engineer employed by Borrower and updating the most recent engineering report delivered to Lenders hereunder, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Agent, said engineering report to utilize economic and pricing parameters used by Agent as established from to time, together with such other information, reports and data concerning the value of such Borrowing Base Properties. Agent shall by written notice to Borrower within a reasonable time after each Redetermination Date (the date of such notice being herein called the "Determination Date") notify Borrower of the designation by Lenders of the new Borrowing Base for the period beginning on such Determination Date and continuing until, but not including, the next Determination Date. If an Unscheduled Redetermination is to be made by Lenders, Agent shall notify Borrower within a reasonable time after receipt of all requested information of the new Borrowing Base, and such new Borrowing Base shall continue until the next Determination Date. If Borrower does not furnish all such information, reports and data by any date specified in this Section 7(b), unless such failure is of no fault of Borrower, Lenders nonetheless shall designate the Borrowing Base at any amounts which Lenders in their discretion determine and redesignate the Borrowing Base from time to time thereafter until Lenders receive all such information, reports and data, whereupon Lenders shall designate a new Borrowing Base as described above. The procedure for determining the Borrowing Base at each redetermination shall be that Agent shall determine the Borrowing Base and submit the same to Lenders. Increases in the Borrowing Base will require approval of all Lenders, but other reaffirmations or changes in the Borrowing Base will be subject to the approval of Required Lenders. The failure of any Lender to respond within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the proposed Borrowing Base shall be deemed to be an approval of the proposed Borrowing Base. If Required Lenders (or all Lenders in the case of an increase in the Borrowing Base) do not approve of Agent's proposed Borrowing Base, Agent shall poll Lenders to determine the highest Borrowing Base that is acceptable to such Lenders that constitute Required Lenders (or all Lenders in the case of an increase in the Borrowing Base), and such amount shall then become the new Borrowing Base. Each Lender shall determine the amount of the Borrowing Base based upon the loan collateral value which such Lender in its sole discretion (using such methodology, assumptions and discount rates as such Lender customarily uses in assigning collateral value to Borrowing Base Properties, oil and gas gathering systems, gas processing and plant operations) assigns to such Borrowing Base Properties at the time in question and based upon such other credit factors consistently applied (including, without limitation, the assets, liabilities, cash flow, business, properties, prospects, management and
 
ownership of Borrower and the effect of Rate Management Transactions in effect at such time) as such Lender customarily considers in evaluating similar oil and gas credits. If at any time any of the Borrowing Base Properties are sold, the Borrowing Base then in effect shall automatically be reduced as required by Section 12(r) hereof. It is expressly understood that Lenders have no obligation to designate the Borrowing Base at any particular amounts, except in the exercise of their discretion, whether in relation to the Commitments or otherwise. Provided, however, that Lenders shall not have the obligation to designate a Borrowing Base in an amount in excess of the Commitment.
     8. 
Unused Commitment Fee.
     Borrower shall pay to Agent for the ratable benefit of Lenders an unused commitment fee (the "Unused Commitment Fee") equivalent to the Unused Commitment Fee Rate times the daily average of the sum of the Borrowing Base minus Total Outstandings. Such Unused Commitment Fee shall be calculated on the basis of a year consisting of 360 days. The Unused Commitment Fee shall be payable in arrears on the last day of each calendar quarter beginning March 31, 2008 with the final fee payment due on the Maturity Date for any period then ending for which the Unused Commitment Fee shall not have been theretofore paid. In the event the Commitment terminates on any date prior to the end of any such quarterly period, Borrower shall pay to Agent for the ratable benefit of Lenders, on the date of such termination, the total Unused Commitment Fee due for the period in which such termination occurs. If a date for payment of the Unused Commitment Fee shall be other than a Business Day such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day.
     9. 
Prepayments.
     (a) . Subject to the provisions of Section 5(e) hereof, Borrower may at any time and from time to time, without penalty or premium, prepay the Notes, in whole or in part. Each such prepayment shall be made on at least three (3) Business Days' notice to Agent in the case of Eurodollar Loan Tranches and without notice in the case of Base Rate Loans and shall be in a minimum amount of (i) $100,000 or any whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof (or the unpaid balance of the Notes, whichever is less), for Base Rate Loans, plus accrued interest thereon and (ii) $1,000,000 or any integral multiple thereof (or the unpaid balance on the Notes, whichever is less) for Eurodollar Loans, plus accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment.
Voluntary Prepayments
     (b) . In the event the Total Outstandings ever exceed the Borrowing Base as determined by Lenders pursuant to Section 7(b) hereof (a "Borrowing Base Deficiency"), Borrower shall, within fifteen (15) days after written notification from Agent, either (i) by instruments reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Agent, provide Agent with collateral with value and quality in amounts satisfactory to all of Lenders in their discretion in order to increase the Borrowing Base by an amount at least equal to such excess, (ii) prepay, without premium or penalty, the principal amount of the Notes in an amount at least equal to such excess plus accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment or (iii) commit to make six (6) equal monthly installment payments in the aggregate amount of the Borrowing Base
Mandatory Prepayment For Borrowing Base Deficiency
 
Deficiency, with the first such installment being due on or before thirty (30) days after Borrower's receipt of Agent's notice of the Borrowing Base Deficiency.
     10. In order to induce Lenders to enter into this Agreement, Borrower represents and warrants to Lenders (which representations and warranties will survive the delivery of the Notes) that:

Taxes; Governmental Charges
     (j) . Borrower or Guarantors have good and defensible title to all of their material assets, including without limitation, the Oil and Gas Properties, free and clear of all Liens except Permitted Liens. Borrower or Guarantors are entitled to receive not less than that percentage of oil, gas and other hydrocarbons produced from the land covered by the leases pertaining to the Oil and Gas Properties included in the Borrowing Base (after deduction of all royalties, overriding royalties and other interests payable
Titles, Etc
 
from or measured by production) equal to the "net revenue interest" specified in the evaluation of such Oil and Gas Properties in the most recent engineering and/or reserve report(s) covering such Oil and Gas Properties which are delivered to Agent hereunder, with the term "net revenue interest" meaning the proportionate share of the production of oil, gas or other minerals to which Borrower or Guarantors are entitled after deduction of all royalties, overriding royalties and other interests payable from or measured by production. Borrower or Guarantors owns the "working interest" in the Oil and Gas Properties included in the Borrowing Base specified in the evaluation of such Oil and Gas Properties in the most recent engineering report(s) and/or reserve reports covering such Oil and Gas Properties which are delivered to Agent hereunder, with the term "working interest", as used herein, meaning the right to explore for, drill and produce oil, gas or other minerals; and Borrower or Guarantors is not obligated to bear more than that percentage of the cost of all operations conducted on the Oil and Gas Properties equal to the "working interest" as above described (other than increases to Borrower's or Guarantors' working interest as a result of non-operator's electing to not participate in a proposed operation under an operating agreement). All material oil, gas and mineral leases which constitute a portion of the Oil and Gas Properties are in full force and effect, and Borrower or Guarantors has not defaulted on any of its obligations thereunder so as to materially impair the value of such leases in the aggregate.
     (k) . Neither Borrower nor any Guarantor is in default and no event or circumstance has occurred which, but for the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default under any loan or credit agreement, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, security agreement or other agreement or instrument to which Borrower or any Guarantor is a party in any respect that would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Default or Event of Default hereunder has occurred and is continuing.

Borrower or any Guarantor and such judgments or orders shall continue unsatisfied and unstayed for a period of thirty (30) days; provided, however, that if any such judgment order is not satisfied or stayed within such 30-day period an Event of Default shall not exist if prior to the end of such 30-day period Borrower provides to Agent an unqualified statement from Borrower's insurance carrier addressed to Agent that the entire amount of such judgment or order is a covered loss under the insurance policies that Borrower maintains with such insurance carrier and that such insurance carrier does not dispute such insurance coverage and will provide Borrower with such proceeds of insurance required to satisfy such judgment or order; or
     (j) Borrower shall fail to pay any obligation owed under any Rate Management Transaction in an amount in excess of $500,000 or in any amount if the obligations of Borrower under any such Rate Management Transaction are secured by the Collateral Documents or any event of default (as defined therein) shall occur as a result of the action or inaction of Borrower under any agreement entered into in connection with any Rate Management Transaction; or

Upon the occurrence of any other Event of Default, Agent, upon request of Required Lenders, shall by written notice to Borrower terminate the Commitment and declare the principal of, and all interest then accrued on, the Notes and any other liabilities hereunder to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon the same shall forthwith become due and payable without presentment, demand, protest, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration or other notice of any kind, all of which Borrower hereby expressly waives, anything contained herein or in the Notes to the contrary notwithstanding.
     Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, Lenders are hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, without notice to Borrower (any such notice being expressly waived by Borrower), to set-off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by any Lender to or for the credit or the account of Borrower against any and all of the indebtedness of Borrower under the Notes and the Loan Documents, including this Agreement, irrespective of whether or not Lenders shall have made any demand under the Loan Documents, including this Agreement or the Notes and although such indebtedness may be unmatured. Any amount set-off by any Lender shall be applied against the indebtedness owed Lenders by Borrower pursuant to this Agreement and the Notes. Lenders agree promptly to notify Borrower
 
after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of Lenders under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) which Lenders may have.
     15. 
Agent and Lenders.
     (a) . Each Lender hereby appoints Agent as its nominee and agent, in its name and on its behalf: (i) to act as nominee for and on behalf of such Lender in and under all Loan Documents; (ii) to arrange the means whereby the funds of Lenders are to be made available to Borrower under the Loan Documents; (iii) to take such action as may be requested by any Lender under the Loan Documents (when such Lender is entitled to make such request under the Loan Documents); (iv) to receive all documents and items to be furnished to Lenders under the Loan Documents; (v) to be the secured party, mortgagee, beneficiary, and similar party in respect of, and to receive, as the case may be, any collateral for the benefit of Lenders; (vi) to promptly distribute to each Lender all material information, requests, documents and items received from Borrower under the Loan Documents; (vii) to promptly distribute to each Lender such Lender's Pro Rata Part of each payment or prepayment (whether voluntary, as proceeds of insurance thereon, or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and (viii) to deliver to the appropriate Persons requests, demands, approvals and consents received from Lenders. Each Lender hereby authorizes Agent to take all actions and to exercise such powers under the Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with all other powers reasonably incidental thereto. With respect to its Commitment hereunder and the Notes issued to it, Agent and any successor Agent shall have the same rights under the Loan Documents as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not Agent; and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include Agent and any successor Agent in its capacity as a Lender. Agent and any successor Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of and generally engage in any kind of business with Borrower, and any person which may do business with Borrower, all as if Agent and any successor Agent was not Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to Lenders; provided that, if any payments in respect of any property (or the proceeds thereof) now or hereafter in the possession or control of Agent which may be or become security for the obligations of Borrower arising under the Loan Documents by reason of the general description of indebtedness secured or of property contained in any other agreements, documents or instruments related to any such other business shall be applied to reduction of the obligations of Borrower arising under the Loan Documents, then each Lender shall be entitled to share in such application according to its Pro Rata Part thereof. Each Lender, upon request of any other Lender, shall disclose to all other Lenders all indebtedness and liabilities, direct and contingent, of Borrower to such Lender as of the time of such request.
Appointment and Authorization
     (b) . From time to time as other Lenders become a party to this Agreement, Agent shall obtain execution by Borrower of additional Notes in amounts representing the Commitments of each such new Lender, up to an aggregate face amount
Note Holders
 
of all Notes not exceeding $200,000,000. The obligation of such Lender shall be governed by the provisions of this Agreement, including but not limited to, the obligations specified in Section 2 hereof. From time to time, Agent may require that Lenders exchange their Notes for newly issued Notes to better reflect the Commitments of Lenders. Agent may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof until written notice of transfer has been filed with it, signed by such payee and in form satisfactory to Agent.
     (c) . Lenders agree that Agent may consult with legal counsel selected by Agent and shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel.
Consultation with Counsel
LENDERS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MURPHY MAHON KEFFLER & FARRIER, L.L.P. IS COUNSEL FOR FROST, BOTH AS AGENT AND AS A LENDER, AND THAT SUCH FIRM DOES NOT REPRESENT ANY OF THE OTHER LENDERS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS TRANSACTION.
     (d) . Agent shall not be under a duty to examine or pass upon the validity, effectiveness, enforceability, genuineness or value of any of the Loan Documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto or in connection therewith, and Agent shall be entitled to assume that the same are valid, effective, enforceable and genuine and what they purport to be.
Documents
     (e) . Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided below, Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to Lenders and Borrower, and Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause by Required Lenders (excluding Agent). If no successor Agent has been so appointed by Required Lenders (and approved by Borrower) and has accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or removal of the retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of Lenders, appoint a successor Agent. Any successor Agent must be approved by Borrower, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent, as the case may be, shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any retiring Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Section 15 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Agent. To be eligible to be an Agent hereunder the party serving, or to serve, in such capacity must own a Pro Rata Part of the Commitments equal to the level of Commitment required to be held by any Lender pursuant to Section 29 hereof.
Resignation or Removal of Agent
     (f) . It is expressly understood and agreed that the obligations of Agent under the Loan Documents are only those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents as to each and that Agent shall be entitled to assume that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, unless Agent has actual knowledge of such fact or has received notice from a Lender or Borrower that such Lender or Borrower considers that a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and
Responsibility of Agent
 
specifying the nature thereof. Neither Agent nor any of its directors, officers, attorneys or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by them under or in connection with the Loan Documents, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Agent shall not incur liability under or in respect of any of the Loan Documents by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate, warranty or other paper or instrument believed by it to be genuine or authentic or to be signed by the proper party or parties, or with respect to anything which it may do or refrain from doing in the reasonable exercise of its judgment, or which may seem to it to be necessary or desirable.
     Agent shall not be responsible to Lenders for any of Borrower's recitals, statements, representations or warranties contained in any of the Loan Documents, or in any certificate or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by any Lender under, the Loan Documents, or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of any of the Loan Documents or for any failure by Borrower to perform any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder. Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized agents, for the negligence or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.
     The relationship between Agent and each Lender is only that of agent and principal and has no fiduciary aspects. Nothing in the Loan Documents or elsewhere shall be construed to impose on Agent any duties or responsibilities other than those for which express provision is therein made. In performing its duties and functions hereunder, Agent does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed, and hereby expressly disclaims, any obligation or responsibility toward or any relationship of agency or trust with or for Borrower or any of its beneficiaries or other creditors. As to any matters not expressly provided for by the Loan Documents, Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of all Lenders and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders and all holders of the Notes; provided, however, that Agent shall not be required to take any action which is contrary to the Loan Documents or applicable law.
     Agent shall have the right to exercise or refrain from exercising, without notice or liability to Lenders, any and all rights afforded to Agent by the Loan Documents or which Agent may have as a matter of law; provided, however, Agent shall not (i) except as provided herein and in Section 7(b) hereof, without the consent of Required Lenders approve the sale, release or substitution of Collateral other than the sale of Collateral permitted pursuant to Section 13(a)(ii) hereof, or (ii) without the consent of Required Lenders, take any other action with regard to amending the Loan Documents, waiving any Default under the Loan Documents, or taking any other action with respect to the Loan Documents. Agent shall not have liability to Lenders for failure or delay in exercising any right or power possessed by Agent pursuant to the Loan Documents or otherwise unless such failure or delay is caused by the gross negligence of Agent, in which case only Agent responsible for such gross negligence shall have liability therefor to Lenders.
 
     (g) . Each Lender severally represents and warrants to Agent that it has made its own independent investigation and assessment of the financial condition and affairs of Borrower in connection with the making and continuation of its participation hereunder and has not relied exclusively on any information provided to such Lender by Agent in connection herewith, and each Lender represents, warrants and undertakes to Agent that it shall continue to make its own independent appraisal of the credit worthiness of Borrower while the Notes are outstanding or its commitments hereunder are in force. Agent shall not be required to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by Borrower of this Agreement or any other document referred to or provided for herein or to inspect the properties or books of Borrower and Guarantors. Other than as provided in this Agreement, Agent shall not have any duty, responsibility or liability to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of Borrower which may come into the possession of Agent.
Independent Investigation
     (h) . Lenders agree to indemnify Agent, its Affiliates, its directors, officers, attorneys and employees (the "Indemnified Agents"), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any proper and reasonable kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by any Indemnified Agent under the Loan Documents, provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from any Indemnified Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Each Lender shall be entitled to be reimbursed by any such Indemnified Agent for any amount such Lender paid to such Indemnified Agent under this Section 15(h) to the extent such Indemnified Agent has been reimbursed for such payments by Borrower or any other Person.
Indemnification
THE PARTIES INTEND FOR THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION TO APPLY TO AND PROTECT AGENT FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY LIABILITY INCLUDING STRICT LIABILITY IMPOSED OR THREATENED TO BE IMPOSED ON ANY INDEMNIFIED AGENT AS WELL AS FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF ITS OWN NEGLIGENCE, WHETHER OR NOT THAT NEGLIGENCE IS THE SOLE, CONTRIBUTING OR CONCURRING CAUSE OF ANY SUCH LIABILITY.
     (i) . The agreements contained in this Section 15 are solely for the benefit of Agent and Lenders and are not for the benefit of, or to be relied upon by, Borrower, any affiliate of Borrower or any other person.
Benefit of Section 15
     (j) . Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, each payment (including each prepayment) by Borrower and each collection by Lenders (including offsets) on account of the principal of and interest on the Notes and fees provided for in this Agreement, that are payable by Borrower, shall be made Pro Rata; provided, however, in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall have failed to make an Advance as contemplated under Section 2 hereof and Agent or another Lender or Lenders shall have made such Advance, payment received by Agent for the account of such
Pro Rata Treatment
 
Defaulting Lender or Lenders shall not be distributed to such Defaulting Lender or Lenders until such Advance or Advances shall have been repaid in full to the Lender or Lenders who funded such Advance or Advances.
     (k) . Except as specifically provided herein, unless Agent shall have received notice from Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to Lenders hereunder that Borrower will not make such payment in full, Agent may, but shall not be required to, assume that Borrower has made such payment in full to Agent on such date and Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to Agent, each Lender shall repay to Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to Agent, at the interest rate applicable to such portion of the Loan.
Assumption as to Payments
     (l) . Without limiting the rights to which any Lender otherwise is or may become entitled, such Lender shall have no interest, by virtue of this Agreement or the Loan Documents, in (a) any present or future loans from, letters of credit issued by, or leasing or other financial transactions by, any other Lender to, on behalf of, or with Borrower (collectively referred to herein as "Other Financings") other than the obligations hereunder; (b) any present or future guarantees by or for the account of Borrower which are not contemplated by the Loan Documents; (c) any present or future property taken as security for any such Other Financings; or (d) any property now or hereafter in the possession or control of any other Lender which may be or become security for the obligations of Borrower arising under any loan document by reason of the general description of indebtedness secured or property contained in any other agreements, documents or instruments relating to any such Other Financings.
Other Financings
     (m) . Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create a partnership or joint venture between Lenders for any purpose. Agent, Lenders and Borrower recognize that the respective obligations of Lenders under the Commitments shall be several and not joint and that neither Agent nor any of Lenders shall be responsible or liable to perform any of the obligations of the other under this Agreement. Each Lender is deemed to be the owner of an undivided interest in and to all rights, titles, benefits and interests belonging and accruing to Agent under the Security Instruments, including, without limitation, liens and security interests in any collateral, fees and payments of principal and interest by Borrower under the Commitments on a Pro Rata basis. Each Lender shall perform all duties and obligations of Lenders under this Agreement in the same proportion as its ownership interest in the Loans outstanding at the date of determination thereof.
Interests of Lenders
     (n) . Whenever Agent in good faith determines that it is uncertain about how to distribute to Lenders any funds which it has received, or whenever Agent in good faith determines that there is any dispute among Lenders about how such funds should be distributed, Agent may choose to defer distribution of the funds which are the subject of such uncertainty or dispute. If Agent in good faith believes that the uncertainty
Investments
 
or dispute will not be promptly resolved, or if Agent is otherwise required to invest funds pending distribution to Lenders, Agent may invest such funds pending distribution (at the risk of Lenders). All interest on any such investment shall be distributed upon the distribution of such investment and in the same proportions and to the same Persons as such investment. All monies received by Agent for distribution to Lenders (other than to the Person who is Agent in its separate capacity as a Lender) shall be held by Agent pending such distribution solely as Agent for such Lenders, and Agent shall have no equitable title to any portion thereof.
     (o) . Borrower and Lenders agree that Agent may delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates. Any such Affiliate (and such Affiliate's directors, officers, agents and employees) which perform duties in connection with this Agreement shall be entitled to the same benefits of the indemnification, waiver and other protective provisions to which Agent is entitled under Sections 15 and 18.
Delegation to Affiliates
     (p) . Lenders hereby empower and authorize Agent to execute and deliver the Security Instruments and all related financing statements and other financing statements, agreements, documents or instruments that shall be necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of the Security Instruments.
Execution of Collateral Documents
     (q) . Lenders hereby empower and authorize Agent to execute and deliver to Borrower or Guarantors on its behalf any agreements, documents, or instruments as shall be necessary or appropriate to reflect any releases of Collateral which shall be permitted by the terms hereof (including, without limitation, the release of Collateral that Borrower or any Guarantor is permitted to sell pursuant to Section 13 hereof) or of any other Loan Document or which shall otherwise have been approved by the Required Lenders pursuant to Section 15 hereof.
Collateral Releases
     16. No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of Agent or Lenders, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The rights of Agent and Lenders hereunder shall be in addition to all other rights provided by law.
Exercise of Rights.

BORROWER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT MURPHY MAHON KEFFLER & FARRIER, L.L.P. IS SPECIAL COUNSEL TO FROST, AS AGENT AND AS A LENDER, UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT IT IS NOT COUNSEL TO, NOR DOES IT REPRESENT BORROWER IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS DESCRIBED IN THIS AGREEMENT.
     19. . Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify Agent, each Lender, their respective Affiliates, and each of their directors, officers, and employees (the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims, damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, all expenses of litigation or preparation therefor of any Indemnified Party, Agent, any Lender or any Affiliate that is a party thereto) which any of them may pay or incur arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the transactions contemplated hereby or the direct or indirect application or proposed application of the proceeds of any loan hereunder even if any of the foregoing arises out of the ordinary negligence of the party seeking indemnification except to the extent that they are determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party seeking indemnification. The indemnity set forth herein shall be in addition to any other obligations or liabilities of Borrower to any Indemnified Party, Agent, and each of Lenders hereunder or at common law or otherwise, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement, the expiration of the Loans and the payment of all indebtedness of Borrower to Lenders hereunder and under the Notes.

ON AGENT AS WELL AS FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF ITS OWN NEGLIGENCE, WHETHER OR NOT THAT NEGLIGENCE IS THE SOLE, CONTRIBUTING, OR CONCURRING CAUSE OF ANY CLAIM.
     20. . The relationship between Borrower on the one hand and Lenders and Agent on the other hand shall be solely that of borrower and lender. Neither Agent, nor any Lender shall have any fiduciary responsibility to Borrower. Neither Agent, nor any Lender undertakes any responsibility to Borrower to review or inform Borrower of any matter in connection with any phase of Borrower's businesses or operations. Borrower agrees that neither Agent, nor any Lender shall have any liability to Borrower (whether sounding in tort, contract or otherwise) for losses suffered by Borrower in connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to, the transactions contemplated and the relationship established by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection therewith, unless it is determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such loss resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party from which recovery is sought. Neither Agent, nor any Lender shall have any liability with respect to, and Borrower hereby waives, releases and agrees not to sue for, any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages suffered by Borrower in connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to this Agreement, the Loan Documents or any transaction contemplated thereby.

Regardless of any provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other documents and instruments referred to herein, Lenders shall never be deemed to have contracted for or be entitled to receive, collect or apply as interest on the Notes any amount in excess of the Maximum Rate, and in the event any Lender ever receives, collects or applies as interest any such excess, or if an acceleration of the maturities of any Notes or if any prepayment by Borrower results in Borrower having paid any interest in excess of the Maximum Rate, such amount which would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the unpaid principal balance of the Notes for which such excess was received, collected or applied, and, if the principal balance of such Note is paid in full, any remaining excess shall forthwith be paid to Borrower. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to Lenders for the use, forbearance or detention of the indebtedness evidenced by the Notes and/or this Agreement shall,
Maximum Interest Rate.
 
to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of such indebtedness until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of such indebtedness does not exceed the Maximum Rate. In determining whether or not the interest paid or payable under any specific contingency exceeds the Maximum Rate of interest permitted by law, Borrower and Lenders shall, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, (i) characterize any non-principal payment as an expense, fee or premium, rather than as interest; and (ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effect thereof; and (iii) compare the total amount of interest contracted for, charged or received with the total amount of interest which could be contracted for, charged or received throughout the entire contemplated term of the Note at the Maximum Rate.
     For purposes of Section 303 of the Texas Finance Code, to the extent applicable to any Lender or Agent, Borrower agrees that the Maximum Rate shall be the "weekly ceiling" as defined in said Chapter, provided that such Lender or Agent, as applicable, may also rely, to the extent permitted by applicable laws of the State of Texas and the United States of America, on alternative maximum rates of interest under the Texas Finance Code or other laws applicable to such Lender or Agent from time to time if greater (the "Maximum Rate").

Exhibit 99.1
News Release
Fort Worth, Texas, March 19, 2008  Approach Resources Inc. (NASDAQ: AREX) today reported its fourth quarter and year end 2007 financial and operating results.
Highlights from 2007 include:
Operations updates for 2008 include:
 
Proved Reserves
The company's estimated total proved reserves of natural gas and oil as of December 31, 2007 were 180.4 Bcfe. The 2007 reserves are composed of 89% natural gas and 11% oil, condensate and natural gas liquids. The proved developed portion of total proved reserves at year end 2007 was 43%. The company's reserve and PV-10 estimates are based on an independent engineering study of the company's oil and gas properties prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton.
The following table summarizes the company's estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2007 by operating area:
The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows for the company's proved reserves at December 31, 2007 was $216.0 million.
The present value of the company's proved reserves, discounted at 10% (PV-10), was estimated at $345.7 million, based on year end prices of $8.10 per Mcf for natural gas, $93.30 per Bbl for oil and $60.09 per Bbl for natural gas liquids. PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and generally differs from the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future cash flows. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for our definition of PV-10 and a reconciliation of PV-10 to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.
The company increased 2007 year end proved reserves 71% to 180.4 Bcfe from 105.4 Bcfe at year end 2006. Pro forma for the November 14, 2007 acquisition from Neo Canyon Exploration, L.P. of the 30% working interest in Ozona Northeast that the company did not already own (as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2006), the company's proved reserves increased 21% from 148.8 Bcfe at December 31, 2006.
 
The following table summarizes the company's changes in proved reserves from December 31, 2006:
Overall in 2007 the company added 80.3 Bcfe of proved reserves, which was offset by production of 5.3 Bcfe. Of the 80.3 Bcfe of proved reserves added in 2007, 29.2 Bcfe were proved developed. Total costs incurred for oil and natural gas properties was $112.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, consisting of $52.2 million for exploration and development drilling and $60.2 million for property acquisitions. In addition, the increase in future development costs related to proved undeveloped reserves from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007 was $111.3 million.
Fourth Quarter 2007
Production for the fourth quarter of 2007 totaled 1.6 Bcfe, compared to 1.6 Bcfe produced in the fourth quarter of 2006. Fourth quarter production was 89% natural gas and 11% oil, condensate and natural gas liquids. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $1.8 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, on revenues of $11.7 million, compared to net income of $2.4 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, on revenues of $9.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2006. The increase in revenues for the fourth quarter was the result of the increase in production from Cinco Terry and higher oil and gas prices. Realized gain on commodity derivatives decreased the company's net loss for the fourth quarter of 2007 by $1.4 million. EBITDAX for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $7.5 million, compared to $9.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2006.
Net loss for the fourth quarter 2007 included $6.7 million of non-recurring compensation expense related to the company's initial public offering ("IPO") of its common stock in November 2007. Net loss for the fourth quarter 2007 was decreased by a tax benefit of $2.8 million related to the release of valuation allowance on net operating loss carryovers generated by Approach Oil & Gas Inc. ("AOG") before the combination of AOG under a contribution agreement on November 14, 2007. Excluding the non-recurring expenses related to the IPO and the tax benefit, adjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure) for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $2.2 million or $0.12 per diluted share.
The company's average realized natural gas and oil prices for the fourth quarter of 2007, before the effect of commodity derivatives, was $6.60 per Mcf and $80.71 per Bbl, respectively, compared to $6.14 per Mcf and $54.78 per Bbl for the fourth quarter of 2006.
General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $8.6 million or $5.36 per Mcfe, compared to $0.7 million or $0.44 per Mcfe for the fourth quarter of 2006. General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter 2007 included $4.5 million in non-cash, share-based compensation (of which $3.9 million was related to the company's IPO), $2.4 million in non-recurring, cash incentive compensation to cover out-of-pocket taxes related to IPO stock awards and $0.5 million of non-recurring, cash incentive compensation related to the IPO. Excluding the non-recurring compensation expenses related to the IPO, adjusted general and administrative expenses (a non-GAAP measure) for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $1.8 million or $1.13 per Mcfe.
 
The company recorded an impairment expense of approximately $267,000 related to the write-off of 2,284 acres in the northwest portion of Ozona Northeast. This acreage is due to expire in April 2008. The loss of identified drilling locations as a result of this write-off was more than offset by additional locations identified from 2007 drilling in Ozona Northeast.
Capital expenditures for drilling and development in the fourth quarter 2007 were $20.7 million. For the fourth quarter of 2007, the company drilled a total of 26 (21 net) wells, 18 (14.5 net) of which had been completed as producers, four (three net) of which were in various stages of completion and four (3.5 net) of which were abandoned. The four wells drilled in the fourth quarter that were waiting on completion at the end of the year have now been completed.
Full Year 2007
Production for 2007 totaled 5.3 Bcfe, or 7.1 Bcfe pro forma for the acquisition of the Neo Canyon interest, compared to 6.7 Bcfe, or 9.6 Bcfe pro forma for the acquisition of the Neo Canyon interest, produced in 2006. 2007 production was 91% natural gas and 9% oil, condensate and natural gas liquids. Net income for 2007 was $2.7 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, on revenues of $39.1 million, compared to net income of $21.2 million, or $2.20 per diluted share, on revenues of $46.7 million for 2006. Realized gain on commodity derivatives increased our net income in 2007 by $4.7 million. EBITDAX for 2007 was $30.4 million, compared to $44.9 million for 2006. The decrease in production, revenues and EBITDAX for 2007 were the result of (1) the natural decline in production of the tight gas Canyon sands in our Ozona Northeast field and (2) the reduction in drilling rigs from four in the second half of 2005 and first half of 2006 to one rig in late 2006 and the first half of 2007.
Net income for 2007 was decreased by $7.9 million of non-recurring compensation expense related to the company's IPO and management's exchange of common stock in 2007 to repay full recourse management notes before the IPO. Net income for 2007 included a tax benefit of $2.8 million related to the release of a valuation allowance on net operating loss carryovers generated by AOG before the combination of AOG under the contribution agreement on November 14, 2007. Excluding the non-recurring expenses related to the IPO, non-recurring expenses related to the share exchange and the tax benefit, adjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure) for 2007 was $7.8 million or $0.70 per diluted share.
The company's average realized prices for 2007, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $6.98 per Mcf of natural gas and $66.87 per Bbl of oil, respectively, compared to $6.66 per Mcf of natural gas and $62.65 per Bbl of oil in 2006.
General and administrative expenses for 2007 were $12.7 million or $2.39 per Mcfe, compared to $2.4 million or $0.36 per Mcfe for 2006. General and administrative expenses for 2007 included $4.6 million in non-cash, share-based compensation (of which $3.9 million was related to the IPO), $2.4 million in non-recurring, cash incentive compensation to cover out-of-pocket taxes related to IPO stock awards, $1.0 million of non-recurring, cash incentive compensation related to the IPO and $0.7 million in cash incentive compensation to cover out-of-pocket taxes related to management's exchange of common stock in 2007 to repay full recourse management notes before the IPO. Excluding the non-recurring compensation related to the company's IPO and share exchange, adjusted general and administrative expenses (a non-GAAP measure) for 2007 were $4.8 million or $0.90 per Mcfe. General and administrative expenses for 2007 also increased over the prior year as a result of higher professional, staffing and public company expenses.
Capital expenditures for drilling and development in 2007 were $52.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2007 the company drilled a total of 71 (60.5 net) wells, 51 (46 net) of which had been completed as producers, seven (5.1 net) of which were in various stages of completion and five (4.2 net)
 
of which were abandoned. Additionally, the company spent $60.2 million on acquisitions in 2007. Of the seven wells waiting on completion at year end, three have now been completed.
Operations Update
. The company drilled a total of 16 developmental Canyon wells during the fourth quarter of 2007, 11 of which were completed as producers, two of which were waiting on completion at the end of the quarter and three of which were abandoned as non-productive. For the year, the company drilled a total of 46 Canyon wells in Ozona Northeast in 2007, 41 of which were completed as producers, two of which were waiting on completion at year end and three of which were abandoned, for a drilling success rate of 93%. Both wells waiting on completion at year end have now been completed as producers. Average daily production for January and February 2008 in Ozona Northeast was 17.6 MMcfe/d (net) and 17.3 MMcfe/d (net), respectively. The company has identified 679 drilling locations in Ozona Northeast as of December 31, 2007, of which 196 are proved.
West Texas  Ozona Northeast
. The company drilled a total of eight (four net) wells in Cinco Terry during the fourth quarter of 2007, five (2.5 net) of which were completed as producers, one (0.5 net) of which was waiting on completion at the end of the quarter and two (one net) of which, as previously reported, were abandoned. For the year, the company drilled a total of thirteen (6.5 net) wells in Cinco Terry, eight (four net) of which were completed as producers, three (1.5 net) of which were awaiting completion at year end and two (one net) of which were abandoned. Two of the three wells waiting on completion at year end have now been completed as producers. Through February 2008, the company had eight (four net) producing Ellenburger wells on line in Cinco Terry. The average initial production rate for the Cinco Terry Ellenburger wells was 1.5 MMcfe/d per well (gross). Average producing rates for the Ellenburger wells during February 2008 were 1.1 MMcfe/d. Average daily production for January and February 2008 in Cinco Terry was 2.3 MMcfe/d (net) and 3.6 MMcfe/d (net), respectively. The company has identified 119 drilling locations in Cinco Terry as of December 31, 2007, of which 36 are proved.
West Texas  Cinco Terry
As previously reported, the company entered into a new gas gathering, processing and sales agreement in late November 2007 that will allow the company to bring on line 100% of its gas production from Cinco Terry. Under the new contract, gas from Cinco Terry will flow to the Benedum plant in Upton County upon completion by the plant operator of a new, six-mile line from the company's facility to the Benedum plant. Gas from Cinco Terry currently flows to the Belvan plant in Crockett County through a temporary line that will not accommodate all of the gas currently capable of being produced from the company's existing Cinco Terry wells. In addition, the company lost eight days of production from Cinco Terry in January 2008 as a result of a shut down of the Belvan plant. Cinco Terry was back on line in late January 2008. The company believes that production will continue to be partially curtailed until connection to the Benedum plant is complete. The company expects to be able to begin flowing gas to Benedum by the end of March 2008.
. The company drilled a total of four (two net) vertical wells in North Bald Prairie during the fourth quarter and for the year in 2007. The company drilled one (0.5 net) additional well in 2008. All five wells have been completed as producers in the Cotton Valley Sand, Bossier Sand and/or Cotton Valley Lime, with average initial production rates of 1.6 MMcf/d per well (gross). Average initial production rates for individual wells in North Bald Prairie ranged from 0.6 MMcf/d to 3.4 MMcf/d (gross). Average daily production for January and February 2008 in North Bald Prairie was 0.5 MMcf/d (net) and 1.5 MMcf/d (net), respectively. The company has identified 61 drilling locations in North Bald Prairie as of December 31, 2007, of which 33 are proved.
East Texas  North Bald Prairie
As previously reported, construction of the gathering system for North Bald Prairie was completed in late November 2007 with initial sales beginning December 11, 2007. The company installed compression in
 
the gathering system during the last week in February 2008. As of March 4, 2008, all five completed wells had been turned to sales.
. The company participated in one (0.25 net) vertical Montney Sand exploratory well in 2007. As previously reported, initial production test rates from this well were 1.1 MMcfe/d (gross). The well currently is shut in by the Canadian operator and waiting on a pipeline connection. In January 2008, the company participated in one (0.25 net) vertical exploratory well. The Canadian operator expects to frac and complete both the Montney Sand and the Doig Shale intervals. A third (0.25 net) well, a horizontal Montney Sand development well, has been drilled, cased and is waiting on completion.
Northeast British Columbia (Montney Trend)
Management Comments
J. Ross Craft, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "2007 was an important year for the company and our stockholders. During 2007, we completed our IPO, acquired the remaining 30% working interest in Ozona Northeast that we didn't already own, paid down all of our debt under our revolving credit facility and grew proved reserves by 71%. We added a total of 38 Bcfe of proved reserves from our newest development drilling projects, Cinco Terry and North Bald Prairie, from 2 Bcfe of proved reserves in those properties at the end of 2006. We have a solid inventory of low-risk, repeatable drilling projects that we expect will provide a foundation for consistent production and reserve growth over the coming years. In 2008 we intend to focus on increasing production in Cinco Terry and North Bald Prairie, developing our emerging unconventional plays in British Columbia, New Mexico and Kentucky and looking for ways to capitalize on new opportunities."
2008 Financial and Operating Guidance Update
The company is revising its guidance previously provided for projected general and administrative expenses from $0.63  $0.65 per Mcfe to $0.75  $0.78 per Mcfe to reflect expected non-cash compensation expenses related to the remaining service period for incentive stock and stock option awards granted before the IPO. The updated 2008 guidance is forward-looking information that is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the company's control, as further described later in this press release.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This release contains certain financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. The company has provided reconciliations within this release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP that are presented in this release.
Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses
This release contains the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted net income and adjusted general and administrative expenses ("G&A"). The amounts included in the calculation of these measures are computed in accordance with GAAP. We believe these measures are useful to investors because they may provide readers with a meaningful measure of the company's profitability before incurring certain non-recurring, cash and non-cash expenses related to the company's IPO and before realizing certain tax benefits. Our reconciliation of these measures to net (loss) income for the fourth quarter and full year 2007 is included in the following tables.
 
The following table provides a reconciliation of net income before the income tax benefit to adjusted net income, excluding non-recurring G&A and the income tax benefit for the quarter and year ending December 31, 2007 (in thousands):
The following table provides a reconciliation of G&A expenses to adjusted G&A expenses for the quarter and year ending December 31, 2007 (in thousands):

The following table shows our reconciliation of our PV-10 to our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows (the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP). PV-10 is our estimate of the present value of future cash flows from estimated proved gas reserves after deducting estimated production and ad valorem taxes, future capital costs and operating expenses, but before deducting any estimates of future income taxes. The estimated future cash flows are discounted at an annual rate of 10% to determine their "present value." We believe PV-10 to be an important measure for evaluating the relative significance of our oil and gas properties and that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure of PV-10 provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating gas and oil companies. Because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid, we believe the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable for evaluating our company. We believe that most other companies in the oil and gas industry calculate PV-10 on the same basis. PV-10 should not be considered as an alternative to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as computed under GAAP.
 
EBITDAX
EBITDAX is presented herein and reconciled to the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund development and exploration activities.
We define EBITDAX as net income, plus (1) exploration and impairment expense, (2) depletion, depreciation and amortization expense, (3) share-based compensation expense, (4) change in fair value of commodity derivatives, (5) interest expense and (6) income taxes. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flow as determined by GAAP.
Our EBITDAX measure provides additional information that may be used to better understand our operations. EBITDAX is one of several metrics that we use as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income, as an indicator of our operating performance. Certain items excluded from EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost of depreciable assets, none of which are components of EBITDAX. EBITDAX as used by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We believe that EBITDAX is a widely followed measure of operating performance and is one of many metrics used by our management team and by other readers of the company's consolidated financial statements. For example, EBITDAX can be used to assess our operating performance and return on capital in comparison to other independent exploration and production companies without regard to financial or capital structure, and to assess the financial performance of our assets and our company without regard to capital structure or historical cost basis.
 
     The following table provides a reconciliation of net (loss) income to EBITDAX (in thousands):

Compensation Matters
     On April 21, 2008, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Approach Resources Inc. (the "Company") ratified a performance-based incentive award program for executive officers in 2008 (the "2008 Incentive Program"). The 2008 Incentive Program was approved by the Compensation and Nominating Committee of the Board (the "Committee") on April 18, 2008 and will be described in the Company's proxy statement for its 2008 annual meeting of stockholders to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or before April 29, 2008.
     Awards under the 2008 Incentive Program ("Annual Incentive Awards") are made pursuant to the Company's 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2007 Plan"). Annual Incentive Awards are determined as a percentage of an executive officer's annual base salary and paid to the executive officer upon the achievement of Company-wide performance targets in four categories, plus one individual performance category.
     The Committee established a minimum, or "threshold," and maximum, or "excellent," performance target for each performance category. The Company is required to reach the threshold target in a performance category before a participant receives any credit for such category in the calculation of his or her Annual Incentive Award. If the Company exceeds the threshold level for a performance category, the amount of the Annual Incentive Award attributable to that category is capped at the excellent level. If the Company's performance falls between the threshold and maximum level, then the amount of the Annual Incentive Award attributable to that category is calculated on a pro-rata basis between the threshold and maximum levels, commensurate with the level of performance achieved.
     The five performance categories established with respect to the Annual Incentive Awards for 2008 are shown in the table below, together with the target levels of achievement with respect to each category (except individual performance) and the relative weight assigned to each category. Four of the performance categories are Company-wide performance measures and the fifth category (individual performance) is personal to each executive and discretionary for the Committee. The individual performance category allows the Committee to consider individual performance such as successful supervision of significant Company projects, cost reductions, overall safety or environmental record, demonstrated departmental leadership and other contributions to the Company.
     In addition to selecting the performance categories discussed above, the Committee approved the Annual Incentive Award targets (expressed as a percentage of annual salary) for each of the Company's named executive officers, as set forth in the table below. For 2008, the Annual Incentive Award amount payable to each named executive officer will be based upon the Company's performance in each of the four company-wide performance categories and the officer's individual performance category. The annual
 
incentive payout percentage will be the sum of the percentage performance targets calculated for each performance category. The actual performance payout amounts for each category are graduated between each performance target in accordance with a predetermined formula that measures performance on a linear, pro-rata basis between the threshold and excellent levels.
     The Committee cannot increase payout amounts under the 2008 Incentive Program. The Committee can, however, in its reasonable discretion, reduce the payout amounts under the program after taking into account special or unusual factors that may have contributed to the achievement of target performance measures such as acquisitions, commodity prices or other such factors deemed appropriate by the Committee.
     The foregoing description of Annual Incentive Awards granted pursuant to the 2007 Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the 2007 Plan, which is filed as Exhibit 10.6 to the Company's registration statement on Form S-1 filed July 12, 2007.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
News Release
     Fort Worth, Texas, May 6, 2008  Approach Resources Inc. (NASDAQ: AREX) today reported its first quarter 2008 financial and operating results.
Highlights
     Highlights from the first quarter 2008 include:
First Quarter 2008
     Production for the first quarter of 2008 totaled 2.0 Bcfe, compared to 1.4 Bcfe produced in the first quarter of 2007, an increase of 46%. First quarter 2008 production was 84% natural gas and 16% oil and NGLs, compared to 91% natural gas and 9% oil and NGLs in the first quarter of 2007.
     Net income for the first quarter of 2008 was $2.8 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, on revenues of $19.0 million, compared to a net loss of $581,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, on revenues of $9.4 million for the first quarter of 2007. A pre-tax unrealized loss on commodity derivatives decreased net income for the first quarter of 2008 by $4.9 million. Excluding the unrealized loss on commodity derivatives and the related income taxes, adjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure) for the first quarter of 2008 was $5.9 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, compared to $2.4 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2007.
 
     EBITDAX (a non-GAAP measure) for the first quarter of 2008 was $15.2 million, compared to $8.7 million for the first quarter of 2007.
     The Company's average realized natural gas, oil and NGL prices for the first quarter of 2008, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $8.93 per Mcf, $97.91 per Bbl and $50.95 per Bbl, respectively, compared to $6.70 per Mcf, $56.22 per Bbl and $30.12 per Bbl for the first quarter of 2007.
     For the first quarter of 2008, lease operating expenses were $1.4 million, or $0.71 per Mcfe, compared to $980,000, or $0.72 per Mcfe, in the first quarter of 2007. Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter of 2008 was $5.2 million, or $2.64 per Mcfe, compared to $3.1 million, or $2.28 per Mcfe, for the prior year quarter. In the first quarter of 2008, dry hole costs totaled $491,000, or $0.25 per Mcfe, compared to $623,000, or $0.46 per Mcfe, for the first quarter of 2007. General and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2008 were $1.9 million, or $0.98 per Mcfe, compared to $1.5 million, or $1.11 per Mcfe, in the first quarter of 2007. General and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2008 included approximately $325,000, or $0.16 per Mcfe, of professional fees related to the year ended December 31, 2007. Severance and production taxes for the first quarter of 2008 were $753,000, or 4.0% of revenues, compared to $375,000, or 4.0% of revenues, for the first quarter of 2007.
     Capital expenditures for drilling and development in the first quarter of 2008 were $15.5 million. For the first quarter of 2008, the Company drilled or participated in a total of 23 (15.9 net) wells, 15 (11 net) of which were completed as producers, five (2.4 net) of which were in various stages of completion and three (2.5 net) of which were abandoned.
2008 Capital Expenditure Budget and Production Guidance
     The Company has increased its 2008 capital expenditure budget from $64.3 million to $80.0 million, a 24% increase. The Company plans to increase capital expenditures by $10.9 million in Cinco Terry and $8.4 million in Ozona Northeast. The Company expects to defer 2008 capital expenditures by $3.6 million in New Mexico. Beginning in June 2008, the Company anticipates adding two rigs to its drilling program through December 31, 2008. In April 2008, the Company moved a rig to Cinco Terry from Ozona Northeast. The Company plans to begin running two rigs in Ozona Northeast beginning in June 2008. The expected addition of two rigs in June will bring the Company's total working rig count to five, with two running in Cinco Terry, two running in Ozona Northeast and one running in North Bald Prairie.
     Regarding the capital expenditure budget increase, Ross Craft, President and CEO of the Company, commented, "The increase in the capital expenditure budget reflects several positive factors for the Company. We are operating in a favorable price environment for natural gas, oil and NGLs. Also, we recently expanded our acreage position in Cinco Terry and are encouraged by the success we have seen in Cinco Terry to date. Further, we are reprocessing 3-D seismic shot over Ozona Northeast, which should allow us to identify Canyon sand channels more effectively."
     In addition to the capital expenditure budget increase, the Company increased its 2008 production target from 8,120 MMcfe  8,450 MMcfe to 8,500 MMcfe  9,000 MMcfe. Based on 2007 production of 7,095 MMcfe (after giving effect to the Ozona Northeast working interest acquisition in November 2007), the Company's revised 2008 production target represents an increase in targeted production growth rate from 14%  19% to 20%  27%. The Company's production guidance is forward-looking information and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control, as further described later in this press release.
 
Borrowing Base Increase
     The Company's bank group, The Frost National Bank and JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA, has completed its semi-annual borrowing base review and increased the Company's borrowing base from $75 million to $100 million under the Company's $200 million credit facility. The increase in the borrowing base is attributable to the Company's December 31, 2007 reserve report. The Company expects the borrowing base to be effective until October 1, 2008 or until the Company or the bank group requests an unscheduled re-determination. As of March 31, 2008, the Company had $7.3 million outstanding under its credit facility.
Northern New Mexico Update
     In late April 2008, the Board of County Commissioners of Rio Arriba County, New Mexico adopted an ordinance purporting to impose a 120-day moratorium on all oil and gas drilling on private lands in Rio Arriba County. The moratorium covers all of the Company's 90,300-acre El Vado East prospect in Rio Arriba County. In addition to the moratorium, the Company has received notice from the county that, after the expiration of the moratorium, the county intends to require the Company to apply for a local zoning permit for oil and gas development in El Vado East. The county has informed the Company that the local permitting process, including public hearings, could take an additional 120 days.
     The Company is evaluating its alternatives, but the county's recent actions are expected to delay the Company's drilling plans in El Vado East. As a result, the Company may not be able to meet its commitment under its mineral lease for El Vado East to drill a minimum of eight wells before the primary term of the lease expires on April 2, 2009. The failure to meet this drilling commitment could result in the termination of the mineral lease, unless the Company agrees with its mineral lessor to extend the primary term of the lease or the drilling commitment is otherwise extended under the terms of the lease. The Company's lease for El Vado East provides that if the Company's drilling operations are delayed or prevented as a result of a governmental or regulatory order or by failure to obtain permits, then the Company's drilling commitment will be extended until 60 days after the cause of the delay is removed, as long as the primary term of the lease is not extended by more than four years. The Company has notified the lessor of the expected delay.
Conference Call Information
     The Company will host a conference call on Wednesday, May 7, 2008, at 10:00 a.m. CDT (11:00 a.m. EDT) to discuss its first quarter 2008 results. To participate in the conference call, domestic participants should dial (888) 891-7634 and international participants should dial (719) 955-1566 approximately 15 minutes before the scheduled conference time.

These include risks relating to financial performance and results, prices and demand for natural gas and oil, availability of drilling equipment and personnel, availability of sufficient capital to execute the Company's business plan, the Company's ability to replace reserves and efficiently develop and exploit its current reserves and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected as described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 28, 2008.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures
     This release contains certain financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. The Company has provided reconciliations within this release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP that are presented in this release.
Adjusted Net Income
     This release contains the non-GAAP financial measure adjusted net income, which excludes the pre-tax unrealized loss on commodity derivatives. Historically, the Company has not designated its derivative instruments as cash-flow hedges. The Company records its open derivative instruments at fair value on its consolidated balance sheets as either unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivatives. The Company records changes in such fair value in earnings on its consolidated statements of operations under "unrealized loss on commodity derivatives." The unrealized loss on commodity derivatives was $4.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2008. Net of taxes, the unrealized loss on commodity derivatives was $3.2 million.
     The amounts included in the calculation of adjusted net income below were computed in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes adjusted net income is useful to investors because it provides readers with a more meaningful measure of the Company's profitability before recording unrealized losses on commodity derivatives.
 
     The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted net income, or net income before the unrealized loss on commodity derivatives and related tax effect, for three months ended March 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively (in thousands):
EBITDAX
     EBITDAX is presented herein and reconciled to the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund development and exploration activities. The Company defines EBITDAX as net income, plus (1) exploration and impairment expense, (2) depletion, depreciation and amortization expense, (3) share-based compensation expense, (4) unrealized loss on commodity derivatives, (5) interest expense and (6) income taxes. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flow as determined by GAAP.
     The Company's EBITDAX measure provides additional information that may be used to better understand its operations. EBITDAX is one of several metrics that the Company uses as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income, as an indicator of our operating performance. Certain items excluded from EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost of depreciable assets, none of which are components of EBITDAX. EBITDAX as used by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that EBITDAX is a widely followed measure of operating performance and is one of many metrics used by our management team and by other readers of the Company's consolidated financial statements. For example, EBITDAX can be used to assess our operating performance and return on capital in comparison to other independent exploration and production companies without regard to financial or capital structure, and to assess the financial performance of the Company without regard to capital structure or historical cost basis.

(NASDAQ: AREX) ("Approach" or the "Company") has acquired additional interests and properties in the Company's 41,176  acre Ozona Northeast field in Crockett and Schleicher Counties, Texas. The properties were acquired from J. Cleo Thompson & James Cleo Thompson, Jr., L.P. and certain other sellers and include:
     The purchase price was $12 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The Company expects to allocate the purchase price $9.5 million to oil and gas properties and $2.5 million to the gathering system, compression facilities and related equipment. Funding will be provided primarily through borrowings under Approach's $100 million revolving credit facility.
     Before the acquisition, Approach owned a 100% working interest above the top of the Strawn formation and a 5% working interest below the top of the Strawn formation in Ozona Northeast. As a result of the acquisition, Approach will now own a 100% working interest in all depths of the subsurface in Ozona Northeast. The Strawn formation sits just above the Ellenburger formation. Approach believes both formations are prospective for additional production and reserves.
     The Company estimates proved reserves from the acquisition to be 7.7 Bcfe and probable reserves to be 1.7 Bcfe. As previously reported, the Company is reprocessing 3-D seismic shot over Ozona Northeast to help identify additional drilling and recompletion opportunities.
     J. Ross Craft, President and CEO, commented, "Ozona Northeast continues to be an important strategic asset to the Company's growth profile with over 600 identified Canyon locations remaining to be drilled. Acquiring the additional 95% interest in the Strawn and Ellenburger formations, plus 75 miles of
 
complementary gathering lines and compression, offers upside reserve potential as well as cost savings on future pipeline installations."
     Mr. Craft further commented, "Based on the knowledge gained from our successful Cinco Terry Ellenburger program, we are optimistic that this acquisition will allow us to realize additional Ellenburger and Strawn reserves. We are close to completing the reprocessing and interpretation of our Ozona Northeast 3-D seismic data as well as the redrafting of our Canyon geological model. Initial results from the reprocessing and interpretation of the seismic data is encouraging in that we believe we will be able to identify individual Canyon sand channels as well as Strawn and Ellenburger anomalies with more precision. Before the reprocessing of the 3-D seismic data, we relied on the drill bit and subsurface mapping in the identification of these bifurcating channel sand deposits and carbonate anomalies. Although we have had good success to date in Ozona Northeast with a drilling success rate of 94%, I feel confident that our efficiency and individual well recoveries will continue to improve."
     A presentation providing further details of the acquisition will be made available under the Investor Relations section of the Company's web site, .

Forward-Looking Statements and Cautionary Statements
     This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this press release that address activities, events or developments that the Company expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, forward-looking statements contained in this press release specifically include the expectations of management regarding proved reserves, probable reserves, cost savings, allocation of purchase price, drilling success and individual well recoveries resulting from the acquisition discussed herein and the reprocessing and interpretation of 3-D seismic data in Ozona Northeast. These statements are based on certain assumptions made by the Company based on management's experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, anticipated future developments and other factors believed to be appropriate and believed to be reasonable by management. Such statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. In particular, careful consideration should be given to the cautionary statements and risk factors described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the
 
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on March 28, 2008 and May 8, 2008, respectively. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the Company undertakes no obligation to correct or update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.
     The SEC has generally permitted oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves that a company has demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically and legally producible under existing economic and operating conditions. The Company uses the terms "estimated ultimate recovery," "EUR," "probable," "possible" and "non-proven" reserves, reserve "potential" or "upside" or other descriptions of volumes of reserves potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that the SEC's guidelines may prohibit the Company from including in filings with the SEC. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of being actually realized by the Company.
     Reserve estimates and estimates of reserve potential or upside with respect to the acquisition discussed herein were made by the Company's internal engineers without review by an independent petroleum engineering firm. Data used to make these estimates were obtained from the sellers and from publicly available information and may not be as complete as that which is available for the Company's owned properties. The Company believes its estimates of proved reserves comply with criteria provided under current rules of the SEC.

Exhibit 99.1
News Release
     Fort Worth, Texas, August 5, 2008  Approach Resources Inc. (NASDAQ: AREX) (the "Company") today reported its second quarter 2008 financial and operating results.
Highlights
     Highlights from the second quarter 2008 (compared to the same period last year) include:
Second Quarter 2008
     Production for the second quarter of 2008 totaled 2.0 Bcfe (22.4 MMcfe/d), compared to 1.3 Bcfe (13.7 MMcfe/d) produced in the second quarter of 2007, an increase of 63%. Second quarter 2008 production was 82.2% natural gas and 17.8% oil and NGLs, compared to 91.5% natural gas and 8.5% oil and NGLs in the second quarter of 2007.
     Net income for the second quarter of 2008 was $0.9 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, on revenues of $24.1 million, compared to net income of $3.0 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, on revenues of $9.7 million for the second quarter of 2007. A pre-tax, unrealized loss on commodity derivatives decreased net income for the second quarter of 2008 by $9.7 million. Excluding the unrealized loss on commodity derivatives and the related income taxes, adjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure) for the second quarter of 2008 was $7.3 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, compared to $1.9 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2007.
     EBITDAX (a non-GAAP measure) for the second quarter of 2008 was $19.0 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, compared to $7.2 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2007.
 
     The Company's average realized natural gas, oil and NGL prices for the second quarter of 2008, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $11.10 per Mcf, $121.29 per Bbl and $53.93 per Bbl, respectively, compared to $7.57 per Mcf, $59.76 per Bbl and $36.92 per Bbl for the second quarter of 2007.
     While the Company benefitted from higher commodity prices, the Company also experienced increased operating costs in the three months ended June 30, 2008 that have partially offset these higher commodity prices. The Company expects that its operating costs, specifically its lease operating, general and administrative and depletion, depreciation and amortization expenses will, for the foreseeable future, be higher than those historically experienced.
     For the second quarter of 2008, lease operating expenses were $1.9 million, or $0.91 per Mcfe, compared to $1.0 million, or $0.83 per Mcfe, in the second quarter of 2007. The increase in lease operating expenses over the prior year quarter was primarily a result of an increase in the number of wells from the ongoing development of Cinco Terry and North Bald Prairie as well as the acquisition of the Neo Canyon working interest in Ozona Northeast. On a per Mcfe basis, the increase in lease operating expenses was primarily due to increased compression and treating costs in Cinco Terry and North Bald Prairie as well as an increase in general maintenance costs in Ozona Northeast. The Company expects that, on a per Mcfe basis, lease operating expenses for Cinco Terry and North Bald Prairie will decrease over time as production from those fields increases.
     Depletion, depreciation and amortization, or DD&A, expense for the second quarter of 2008 was $6.0 million, or $2.93 per Mcfe, compared to $3.0 million, or $2.41 per Mcfe, for the prior year quarter. The increase in DD&A was primarily attributable to increased production and higher capital costs in the 2008 period. The higher DD&A expense per Mcfe was primarily attributable to higher capital costs in North Bald Prairie and reserve revisions in Ozona Northeast at December 31, 2007. In North Bald Prairie, the Company paid capital costs attributable to the 50% working interest owned by the Company's working interest partner pursuant to the Company's farm-in agreement on the first five wells drilled.
     In the second quarter of 2008, exploration expense totaled $987,000, or $0.48 per Mcfe, compared to $10,000, or $0.01 per Mcfe, for the second quarter of 2007. Exploration expense in the second quarter of 2008 resulted primarily from the extension of lease terms in Ozona Northeast. General and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2008 were $1.8 million, or $0.89 per Mcfe, compared to $1.2 million, or $0.97 per Mcfe, in the second quarter of 2007. Severance and production taxes for the second quarter of 2008 were $1.2 million, or 5% of revenues, compared to $373,000, or 3.8% of revenues, for the second quarter of 2007.
     Capital expenditures for drilling and development in the second quarter of 2008 were $20.3 million. For the second quarter of 2008, the Company drilled or participated in a total of 28 (18 net) wells, 17 (10 net) of which were completed as producers, six (4.5 net) of which were in various stages of completion and five (3.5 net) of which were drilled and abandoned. Five (three net) wells that were in various stages of completion at the end of the second quarter have since been completed as producers.
     The increase in production over the prior year quarter was partially offset by compressor downtime in the second quarter. Also, the Company postponed drilling in Ozona Northeast during portions of April and May, 2008, while the Company was reprocessing 3-D seismic data and closing the previously-announced acquisition of deep rights in Ozona Northeast. Further, the Company delayed the drilling of its second series of five wells in North Bald Prairie during parts of the first and second quarters of 2008, pending partner approval of drilling locations. The Company currently has five rigs running, with two in Ozona Northeast, two in Cinco Terry and one in North Bald Prairie.
 
     Average daily production for the month of July 2008 was 24.3 MMcfe/d, with an exit rate at July 31, 2008 of 25.1 MMcfe/d.
First Six Months of 2008 Results
     Production for the first six months of 2008 totaled 4.0 Bcfe (22.1 MMcfe/d), compared to 2.6 Bcfe (14.4 MMcfe/d) produced in the same period in 2007, an increase of 54%. The Company's average realized natural gas, oil and NGL prices for the six months ended June 30, 2008, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $10.02 per Mcf, $110.10 per Bbl and $52.61 per Bbl, respectively, compared to $7.12 per Mcf, $57.83 per Bbl and $33.39 per Bbl for the six months ended June 30, 2007.
     Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2008 was $3.7 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, on revenues of $43.2 million, compared to net income of $2.4 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, on revenues of $19.1 million for the same period in 2007. A pre-tax, unrealized loss on commodity derivatives decreased net income for the first six months of 2008 by $14.6 million. Excluding the unrealized loss on commodity derivatives and the related income taxes, adjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure) for the first six months of 2008 was $13.3 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, compared to $4.3 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, for the first six months of 2007. Both net income and adjusted net income were impacted by higher lease operating, depletion, depreciation and amortization and exploration expenses in the first six months of 2008.
     EBITDAX (a non-GAAP measure) for the first six months of 2008 was $34.2 million, or $1.64 per diluted share, compared to $15.9 million, or $1.61 per diluted share, for the first six months of 2007.
     While the Company benefitted from higher commodity prices, the Company also experienced increased operating costs in the six months ended June 30, 2008 that have partially offset these higher commodity prices. The Company expects that its operating costs, specifically its lease operating, general and administrative and depletion, depreciation and amortization expenses will, for the foreseeable future, be higher than those historically experienced.
     For the six months ended June 30, 2008, lease operating expenses were $3.3 million, or $0.81 per Mcfe, compared to $2.0 million, or $0.78 per Mcfe, in the six months ended June 30, 2007. The primary factors in the increase in lease operating expense were the acquisition of the Neo Canyon interest and the increase in the number of wells from our ongoing development of our three producing fields. On a per Mcfe basis, the increase in lease operating expenses was primarily due to increased compression and treating costs in Cinco Terry and North Bald Prairie as well as an increase in general maintenance costs in Ozona Northeast. The Company expects that, on a per Mcfe basis, lease operating expenses for Cinco Terry and North Bald Prairie will decrease over time as production from those fields increases.
     Depletion, depreciation and amortization, or DD&A, expense for the six months ended June 30, 2008 was $11.2 million, or $2.78 per Mcfe, compared to $6.1 million, or $2.34 per Mcfe, for the prior year period. The increase in DD&A expense was primarily attributable to increased production and higher capital costs during the year ended December 31, 2008. The higher DD&A expense per Mcfe was primarily attributable to higher capital costs in North Bald Prairie and reserve revisions in Ozona Northeast at December 31, 2007. In North Bald Prairie, the Company paid capital costs attributable to the 50% working interest owned by the Company's working interest partner pursuant to the Company's farm-in agreement on the first five wells drilled.
 
     In the first six months of 2008, exploration expense totaled $1.5 million, or $0.37 per Mcfe, compared to $633,000, or $0.24 per Mcfe, for the first six months of 2007. Exploration expense for the first six months of 2008 resulted primarily from lease extensions in Ozona Northeast and one dry hole drilled in Ozona Northeast, while exploration expense for the prior year period resulted from the drilling of a test well in the Company's Boomerang project.
     General and administrative expenses for the first six months of 2008 were $3.8 million, or $0.94 per Mcfe, compared to $2.7 million, or $1.05 per Mcfe, for the first six months of 2007. Severance and production taxes for the first six months of 2008 were $1.9 million, or 4.4% of revenues, compared to $748,000, or 3.9% of revenues, for the prior year period. The increase in general and administrative expense was principally due to increased staffing, salaries, professional fees, share-based compensation, insurance and travel costs in the 2008 period over the 2007 period.
Management Comments
     J. Ross Craft, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Due in part to an increase in industry-wide costs and to curtailed production growth from the first quarter to the second quarter of 2008, we saw our per-unit operating cost structure increase in the second quarter. The curtailed production growth during the second quarter was due in part to compression downtime and drilling delays in Ozona Northeast and East Texas. Despite these challenges, my outlook for the second half of 2008 remains positive. We are starting to see early results from reevaluating our geological model and acquiring the deep rights in Ozona Northeast. We recently drilled and completed our first Strawn well in Ozona Northeast since our acquisition. Initial flow rates from the J.R. Bailey A 313 averaged 987 Mcfe with a flowing pressure of 1700 psig over an initial 24-hour period. In addition to the productive Strawn interval, we encountered an expanded Canyon sand section. This expanded sand package should facilitate further expansion of our proved acreage position. We also have identified several attractive Canyon recompletion opportunities resulting from the acquisition. We are currently incorporating the recompletions into our existing stimulation schedule and plan on starting this program in the third quarter of 2008. Our exit rate of 25.1 MMcfe/d at July 31, 2008, is a record high for the Company. Given our existing drilling inventory we believe we are well positioned to grow shareholder value in 2008 and beyond."
British Columbia Asset Divestiture
     On July 15, 2008, we announced that the operator and non-operating participants in the our British Columbia lease acquisition and drilling project engaged a financial advisor to explore the sale of the project's oil and gas interests in northeast British Columbia. The financial advisor has solicited bids for the purchase of these assets. Initial bids are due mid-August 2008. The project covers 29,954 (gross) and 28,309 (net) acres in the Monias/Charlie Lake areas. The project primarily targets Montney tight gas and Doig phosphate shale formations. We hold a 25% non-operating interest in the project.
Northern New Mexico Update
     On July 21, 2008, the Governor of New Mexico directed the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division and Oil Conservation Commission to propose new rules and initiate a formal rulemaking for oil and gas operations in Eastern Rio Arriba County, including the Company's leasehold in El Vado East. In light of the Governor's directive, the Company withdrew its litigation that was pending in federal district court for the District of New Mexico against Rio Arriba County. The Company's withdrawal of the pending litigation does not affect its ability to reinstitute proceedings against Rio Arriba County at a later date.

Commodity Derivative Activities
     At June 30, 2008, the Company had the following commodity derivative positions outstanding:
 
Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures
     This release contains certain financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. The Company has provided reconciliations within this release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP that are presented in this release.
Adjusted Net Income
     This release contains the non-GAAP financial measure adjusted net income, which excludes the pre-tax, unrealized loss on commodity derivatives. Historically, the Company has not designated its derivative instruments as cash-flow hedges. The Company records its open derivative instruments at fair value on its consolidated balance sheets as either unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivatives. The Company records changes in such fair value in earnings on its consolidated statements of operations under "unrealized loss (gain) on commodity derivatives." The unrealized loss on commodity derivatives was $9.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2008. Net of taxes, the unrealized loss on commodity derivatives for the three months ended June 30, 2008 was $6.4 million.
     The amounts included in the calculation of adjusted net income below were computed in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes adjusted net income is useful to investors because it provides readers with a more meaningful measure of the Company's profitability before recording unrealized losses on commodity derivatives.
     The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted net income, or net income before the unrealized (loss) gain on commodity derivatives and related tax effect, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively (in thousands):
EBITDAX
     EBITDAX is presented herein and reconciled to the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund development and exploration activities. The Company defines EBITDAX as net income, plus (1) exploration expense, (2) depletion, depreciation and amortization expense, (3) share-based compensation expense, (4) unrealized loss (gain) on commodity derivatives, (5) interest expense and (6) income taxes. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flow as determined by GAAP.
 
     The Company's EBITDAX measure provides additional information that may be used to better understand its operations. EBITDAX is one of several metrics that the Company uses as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income, as an indicator of our operating performance. Certain items excluded from EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost of depreciable assets, none of which are components of EBITDAX. EBITDAX as used by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that EBITDAX is a widely followed measure of operating performance and is one of many metrics used by our management team and by other readers of the Company's consolidated financial statements. For example, EBITDAX can be used to assess our operating performance and return on capital in comparison to other independent exploration and production companies without regard to financial or capital structure, and to assess the financial performance of the Company without regard to capital structure or historical cost basis.
     The following table provides a reconciliation of net income to EBITDAX (in thousands):

Exhibit 99.1
News Release
     Fort Worth, Texas, November 5, 2008  Approach Resources Inc. (NASDAQ: AREX) (the "Company") today reported its third quarter 2008 financial and operating results.
Highlights
     Highlights from the third quarter 2008 (compared to the same period last year) include:
Third Quarter 2008 Results
     Production for the third quarter of 2008 totaled 2.1 Bcfe (22.6 MMcfe/d), compared to 1.2 Bcfe (13.4 MMcfe/d) produced in the third quarter of 2007, an increase of 69%. As previously reported, production growth for the third quarter of 2008 was negatively impacted by shut-in production over a period of 23 days in Ozona Northeast, the Company's largest producing field, caused by a disruption in downstream NGL facilities due to Hurricane Ike, and by the rupture of a third-party pipeline. The Company estimates that approximately 340 MMcfe was shut in during the third quarter of 2008. Third quarter 2008 production was 76.3% natural gas and 23.7% oil and NGLs, compared to 92.1% natural gas and 7.9% oil and NGLs in the third quarter of 2007.
     Net income for the third quarter of 2008 was $19.8 million, or $0.95 per diluted share, on revenues of $22.0 million, compared to net income of $2.1 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, on revenues of $8.3 million for the third quarter of 2007. An unrealized, pre-tax gain on commodity derivatives increased net income for the third quarter of 2008 by $18.6 million. Excluding the unrealized gain on commodity derivatives and the related income taxes, adjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure)
 
for the third quarter of 2008 was $7.6 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, compared to $1.6 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2007.
     EBITDAX (a non-GAAP measure) for the third quarter of 2008 was $17.4 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, compared to $6.9 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2007.
     The Company's average realized natural gas, oil and NGL prices for the third quarter of 2008, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $9.10 per Mcf, $110.61 per Bbl and $56.64 per Bbl, respectively, compared to $6.34 per Mcf, $72.14 per Bbl and $44.50 per Bbl for the third quarter of 2007.
     For the third quarter of 2008, lease operating expenses, or LOE, were $1.8 million, or $0.89 per Mcfe, compared to $760,000, or $0.62 per Mcfe, in the third quarter of 2007. The increase in LOE over the prior year quarter was primarily a result of the acquisition of the Neo Canyon working interest and Strawn/Ellenburger deep rights in Ozona Northeast, increased ad valorem taxes, including a retroactive adjustment related to the first six months of 2008, initial startup costs, including increased compression and treating costs associated with increased development activities in Cinco Terry and North Bald Prairie, and an increase in general maintenance costs in Ozona Northeast.
     Compared to the second quarter of 2008 the Company reduced LOE in the third quarter of 2008 by $0.02 from $0.91 per Mcfe to $0.89 per Mcfe. In addition, LOE was negatively impacted in the third quarter of 2008, on a per Mcfe basis, by the loss of an estimated 340 MMcfe of shut-in production. Excluding the estimated impact of 340 MMcfe of shut-in production in the third quarter of 2008, the Company estimated that LOE for the third quarter of 2008 would have been $0.76 per Mcfe, or a decrease of $0.15 per Mcfe from $0.91 per Mcfe in second quarter of 2008.
     Depletion, depreciation and amortization, or DD&A, expense for the third quarter of 2008 was $5.0 million, or $2.41 per Mcfe, compared to $3.1 million, or $2.52 per Mcfe, for the prior year quarter. The increase in DD&A on an absolute basis was primarily due to increased production and higher capital costs compared to the prior year period, which were partially offset by an increase in the Company's estimated proved reserves at June 30, 2008.
     General and administrative, or G&A, expenses for the third quarter of 2008 were $1.9 million, or $0.92 per Mcfe, compared to $1.4 million, or $1.12 per Mcfe, in the third quarter of 2007.
     Severance and production taxes for the third quarter of 2008 were $1.0 million, or 4.4% of revenues, compared to $400,000, or 4.8% of revenues, for the third quarter of 2007.
First Nine Months of 2008 Results
     Production for the first nine months of 2008 totaled 6.1 Bcfe (22.2 MMcfe/d), compared to 3.8 Bcfe (14.1 MMcfe/d) produced in the same period in 2007, an increase of 59%. As discussed above, production volumes for the first nine months of 2008 were negatively impacted by an estimated 340 MMcfe of shut-in production during the third quarter.
     Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was $23.5 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, on revenues of $65.2 million, compared to net income of $4.5 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, on revenues of $27.4 million for the same period in 2007. An unrealized, pre-tax gain on commodity derivatives increased net income for the first nine months of 2008 by $4.1 million. Excluding the unrealized gain on commodity derivatives and the related income taxes, adjusted net income (a non-
 
GAAP measure) for the first nine months of 2008 was $20.9 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, compared to $5.9 million, or $0.51 per diluted share for the same period in 2007.
     EBITDAX (a non-GAAP measure) for the first nine months of 2008 was $51.6 million, or $2.48 per diluted share, compared to $22.8 million, or $1.96 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2007.
     The Company's average realized natural gas, oil and NGL prices for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $9.72 per Mcf, $110.19 per Bbl and $54.05 per Bbl, respectively, compared to $6.87 per Mcf, $61.50 per Bbl and $37.80 per Bbl for the nine months ended September 30, 2007.
     For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, LOE was $5.1 million, or $0.84 per Mcfe, compared to $2.8 million, or $0.72 per Mcfe, in the nine months ended September 30, 2007. The primary factors in the increase in LOE were the acquisition of the Neo Canyon working interest and Strawn/Ellenburger deep rights in Ozona Northeast, increased ad valorem taxes, initial startup costs, including increased compression and treating costs associated with increased development activities in Cinco Terry and North Bald Prairie, and an increase in general maintenance costs in Ozona Northeast.
     DD&A expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was $16.3 million, or $2.67 per Mcfe, compared to $9.2 million, or $2.40 per Mcfe, for the prior year period. The increase in DD&A expense was primarily attributable to increased production and higher capital costs during the first nine months of 2008. The higher DD&A expense per Mcfe was primarily attributable to higher capital costs in North Bald Prairie during the third quarter of 2008 and reserve revisions in Ozona Northeast at December 31, 2007. In North Bald Prairie, the Company paid capital costs attributable to the 50% working interest owned by the Company's working interest partner under the Company's farm-in agreement on the first five wells drilled.
     In the first nine months of 2008, exploration expense totaled $1.5 million, or $0.24 per Mcfe, compared to $633,000, or $0.16 per Mcfe, for the first nine months of 2007. Exploration expense for the first nine months of 2008 resulted primarily from lease extensions in Ozona Northeast and one dry hole drilled in Ozona Northeast, while exploration expense for the prior year period resulted from the drilling of a test well in the Company's Boomerang project.
     G&A expenses for the first nine months of 2008 were $5.7 million, or $0.93 per Mcfe, compared to $4.1 million, or $1.07 per Mcfe, for the first nine months of 2007. The increase in G&A on an absolute basis was principally due to increased staffing, salaries, professional fees, share-based compensation, insurance and travel costs in the 2008 period over the 2007 period. The 2008 period increase was partially offset by bonus payments made in the 2007 period to cover tax liabilities incurred by management in connection with the exchange of shares of common stock to repay management notes before the Company's initial public offering and a severance payment to a former employee.
     Severance and production taxes for the first nine months of 2008 were $2.9 million, or 4.4% of revenues, compared to $1.1 million, or 4.2% of revenues, for the prior year period.
Operations Update
     For the third quarter of 2008, the Company drilled or participated in a total of 30 (23 net) wells, 21 (16.5 net) of which were completed as producers, six (4.5 net) of which were in various stages of completion and three (two net) of which were drilled and abandoned. Five (3.5 net) wells that were in various stages of completion at the end of the third quarter have since been completed as producers.
 
     During the third quarter of 2008, the Company successfully recompleted five wells in the Canyon Sands in Cinco Terry.
     During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company plans six Canyon Sand recompletions in Ozona Northeast. These wells were acquired in the Strawn and Ellenburger deep rights acquisition that closed on July 1, 2008. The Company expects to recomplete these wells for approximately $325,000 each. The Company has also identified several Strawn deepening projects as well as additional Canyon locations as a result of the Company's reprocessed 3-D seismic data.
     The Company's estimated average daily production for the month of October 2008 was 30.4 MMcfe/d.
     In October 2008, through a combination of The University of Texas System's Lease Sale and private transactions, the Company leased an additional 7,512 gross (3,881 net) acres adjacent to the Company's Cinco Terry project in Crockett County, Texas. The Company believes the acreage is prospective for Ellenburger, Canyon Sands and Wolfcamp production. The additional acreage expands the Company's Cinco Terry project to a total of 38,892 gross (18,334 net) acres.
Capital Expenditures, Liquidity and Commodity Derivatives Update
     Capital expenditures for drilling and development in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008 were $36.4 million and $72.2 million, respectively. The $72.2 million in capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 included $11.5 million related to the acquisition of the additional 95% interest in the Strawn and Ellenburger formations and 75 miles of complementary gathering lines and compression in Ozona Northeast, $3.2 million in lease acquisitions, geological and geophysical and other related costs and $2.4 million in tubular inventory.
     The Company has a $200 million revolving credit facility with a $100 million borrowing base. On August 26, 2008, the Company entered into a third amendment to its revolving credit facility, which increased the number of lenders from two to four and allocated the lenders' commitment percentages as follows: The Frost National Bank  30%, JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA  30%, Fortis Capital Corp.  20% and KeyBank National Association  20%. The maturity date under the revolving credit facility is July 31, 2010. The Company had outstanding borrowings of $23.5 million at September 30, 2008, and $27.1 million outstanding at October 31, 2008. Outstanding borrowings under the Company's credit facility increased during the third quarter and first month of the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of lost revenues from shut-in production at Ozona Northeast and increased drilling activity in Cinco Terry and North Bald Prairie.
 
     At September 30, 2008, the Company had the following commodity derivatives positions outstanding. J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corporation is currently the Company's only commodity derivatives counterparty.
Management Comments
     J. Ross Craft, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer commented that, "Despite shut-in production over 23 days as a result of Hurricane Ike and a third-party pipeline rupture, and an estimated loss of 340 MMcfe of production volumes during the third quarter, the Company increased production 69% over the prior year quarter and held production stable from the second quarter of 2008. In addition, we were able to reduce operating expenses on a per Mcfe basis from the second quarter of 2008 despite the unusual production interruptions. We are encouraged by the continued success of our repeatable, low-risk drilling operations in our West Texas properties."
     "We are currently evaluating capital expenditure and operating rig scenarios for 2009 to balance development of our core areas with internally generated cash flow in 2009 and to preserve liquidity under our revolving credit facility. We intend to focus our 2009 capital expenditures on developing our West Texas properties that can continue to provide economic rates of return and production growth despite a volatile commodity price environment. Further, we expect to maintain financial and operational flexibility to respond quickly to rapidly-changing market conditions and potential growth opportunities. We anticipate announcing our 2009 capital expenditure budget and production and operating guidance before the year end. The Company is in a good position to capitalize on potential opportunities created during these uncertain times with a healthy balance sheet and commodity derivatives in place to mitigate some of the risk of fluctuating commodity prices, and we will continue our efforts to grow long-term shareholder value."

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures
     This release contains certain financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. The Company has provided reconciliations within this release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP that are presented in this release.
Adjusted Net Income
     This release contains the non-GAAP financial measure adjusted net income, which excludes the unrealized, pre-tax gain on commodity derivatives. Historically, the Company has not designated its derivative instruments as cash-flow hedges. The Company records its open derivative instruments at fair value on its consolidated balance sheets as either unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivatives. The Company records changes in such fair value in earnings on its consolidated statements of operations under "unrealized gain (loss) on commodity derivatives." The unrealized, pre-tax gain on commodity derivatives was $18.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2008. Net of taxes, the unrealized gain on commodity derivatives for the three months ended September 30, 2008 was $12.3 million.
     The amounts included in the calculation of adjusted net income below were computed in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes adjusted net income is useful to investors because it provides readers with a more meaningful measure of the Company's profitability before recording unrealized losses on commodity derivatives.
 
     The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted net income, or net income before the unrealized gain (loss) on commodity derivatives and related tax effect, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively (in thousands):
EBITDAX
     EBITDAX is presented herein and reconciled to the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund development and exploration activities. The Company defines EBITDAX as net income, plus (1) exploration expense, (2) depletion, depreciation and amortization expense, (3) share-based compensation expense, (4) unrealized loss (gain) on commodity derivatives, (5) interest expense and (6) income taxes. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flow as determined by GAAP.
     The Company's EBITDAX measure provides additional information that may be used to better understand its operations. EBITDAX is one of several metrics that the Company uses as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income, as an indicator of our operating performance. Certain items excluded from EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost of depreciable assets, none of which are components of EBITDAX. EBITDAX as used by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that EBITDAX is a widely followed measure of operating performance and is one of many metrics used by our management team and by other readers of the Company's consolidated financial statements. For example, EBITDAX can be used to assess our operating performance and return on capital in comparison to other independent exploration and production companies without regard to financial or capital structure, and to assess the financial performance of the Company without regard to capital structure or historical cost basis.
 
     The following table provides a reconciliation of net income to EBITDAX (in thousands):

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e) Amendments of Compensatory Plans; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
Effective December 31, 2008, Approach Resources Inc. (the "Company") executed amendments (collectively, the "Amendments") to (i) its 2007 Stock Incentive Plan ("Stock Incentive Plan"), (ii) Employment Agreements ("Employment Agreements") with J. Ross Craft (President and Chief Executive Officer), Steven P. Smart (Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer) and Glenn W. Reed (Executive Vice President  Engineering and Operations) , and (iii) Indemnity Agreements ("Indemnity Agreements") with each of its directors and executive officers. The Amendments affect various participants in the plans and arrangements, including each of the Company's named executive officers listed in the Company's proxy statement for its 2008 Annual Meeting of Stockholders: J. Ross Craft (President and Chief Executive Officer), Steven P. Smart (Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer) Glenn W. Reed (Executive Vice President  Engineering and Operations), J. Curtis Henderson (Executive Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel) and Ralph P. Manoushagian (Executive Vice President  Land).
The Amendments reflect, among other things, changes necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively "Section 409A"). Section 409A was enacted in 2004 and governs "nonqualified deferred compensation" arrangements. Section 409A imposes accelerated tax and additional tax on employees and other service providers who are parties to a nonqualified deferred compensation arrangement if the arrangement does not comply with Section 409A. Although Section 409A went into effect in 2005, final regulations were not issued until 2007. Companies must amend affected nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements by December 31, 2008 to ensure compliance with Section 409A.
Amendment to Stock Incentive Plan
The Amendment to the Stock Incentive Plan provides, among other things, for the following:
     (i) Adjustments to outstanding awards and award agreements in the event of a recapitalization or reorganization will be made in accordance with Sections 422, 424 and 409A of the Code;
     (ii) Individuals who provide services to Affiliates (as defined in the Stock Incentive Plan) that are not considered a single employer with the Company under Section 414(b) or (c) of the Code will not be eligible to receive awards under the Stock Incentive Plan until the Affiliate adopts the Stock Incentive Plan as a participating employer;
     (iii) Nonqualified stock options and stock appreciation rights may only be granted to individuals performing services for the Company or other entity in a chain of entities in which each entity has a "controlling interest" in another entity in the chain; and
     (iv) Any Affiliate not considered a single employer with the Company under Section 414(b) or (c) may adopt the Stock Incentive Plan by written instrument delivered to the Compensation and Nominating Committee before the grant of any award subject to Section 409A.
Amendments to Employment Agreements
The Amendments to the Employment Agreements provide, among other things, for the following:
 
     With respect to Mr. Craft:
     (i) The amount and timing of expense reimbursements will conform to the requirements of Section 409A;
     (ii) The definition of "Good Reason" is amended to conform to Section 409A, including an extension of the cure period for the Company from 10 to 30 days and the addition of notice and exercise periods in which the Employee must take action;
     (iii) Section 409A prohibits different forms of payment upon different types of separations. Therefore, the Amendment provides that all separation payments will be made at the same time and in the same form for all types of separations. Payments made upon termination by the Company without Cause (as defined in the Employment Agreement), upon election by the Company not to extend the Employment Agreement or upon termination by the Employee for Good Reason (as defined by the Employment Agreement) will be made within 60 days following a Separation of Service (as defined in the Employment Agreement), rather than within 90 days for termination for Good Reason and 24 months after termination without Cause or non-extension by the Company under the original Employment Agreement. The 90-day period was changed to 60 days due to Section 409A;
     (iv) The Amendment clarifies that a payment on Change in Control (as defined in the Employment Agreement) is not intended to be paid in addition to other, salary-based separation payments payable under the Employment Agreement in the event of a termination not for Cause or without Good Reason, and Change in Control payments will be made within 60 days following the Change in Control, rather than 24 months under the original Employment Agreement; and
     (v) Payment of benefits under the Company's welfare benefits plans after employment will be limited to the period of eligibility under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ("COBRA").
     With respect to Messrs. Smart and Reed:
     (i) The amount and timing of expense reimbursements will conform to the requirements of Section 409A;
     (ii) Section 409A prohibits different forms of payment upon different types of separations. Therefore, the Amendment provides that all separation payments will be made at the same time and in the same form for all types of separations. Payments made upon termination by the Company without Cause, upon election by the Company not to extend the Employment Agreement or upon termination by the Employee for Good Reason will be made within 60 days following a Separation of Service, rather than within 90 days upon breach by the Company and 24 months after termination without Cause or non-extension by the Company under the original Employment Agreement. The 90-day period was changed to 60 days due to Section 409A;
     (iii) Payment of benefits under the Company's welfare benefits plans after employment will be limited to the period of eligibility under COBRA.
Amendment to Form of Indemnity Agreement
The Company is a party to Indemnity Agreements with each of its directors and executive officers. The indemnity agreements provide that directors and executive officers will be indemnified to the fullest
 
extent allowed by law against expenses and settlement amounts paid or incurred by them as a director or executive officer of the Company. The Amendment to the Form Indemnity Agreement for each of the directors and executive officers conforms the amount and timing of expense reimbursements under the Indemnity Agreements to the requirements of Section 409A.
The foregoing description is a summary of the Amendments and does not purport to be a complete statement of the parties' rights and obligations under the applicable agreements. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amendments, which are filed as Exhibits 10.1 through 10.5 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, respectively, and are incorporated by reference herein.

"controlling interest" in another corporation or entity in the chain, starting with Approach and ending with the corporation or other entity for which the Employee, Outside Director or other individual or entity performs services.
     5. The Plan is hereby amended by the addition of the following as Section 15.18:

Exhibit 10.2
     This First Amendment to Employment Agreement ("Amendment") is effective December 31, 2008, and serves to modify only those certain terms of the Employment Agreement ("Agreement") dated and effective January 1, 2003, between Approach Resources Inc.

Exhibit 10.5
     This Amendment to Indemnity Agreement is entered into and effective as of December 31, 2008, by and between Approach Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and (the "Indemnitee").
                    
                    
     WHEREAS, the Company and the Indemnitee entered into an Indemnity Agreement effective as of July 12, 2007 (the "Indemnity Agreement"); and
     WHEREAS, the Company and the Indemnitee now desire to amend the Indemnity Agreement for compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the Treasury Regulations and other guidance thereunder;
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the parties do hereby agree as follows:
     1. The Indemnity Agreement is hereby amended to add a new Section 27 to the end thereof to read as follows:
     27. Expenses payable pursuant to this Indemnity Agreement are intended to satisfy the indemnification arrangement exception to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any reimbursement of an Expense constitutes deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A (other than a "tax gross-up payment"), such Expense shall be paid by the end of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which the Expense is incurred, and the amount of such Expenses eligible for reimbursement during any calendar year will not affect the amount of Expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other calendar year. With respect to an Expense that is a "tax gross-up payment" as defined in the Treasury Regulations under Code Section 409A, such tax gross-up payment will be paid to the Indemnitee by the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Indemnitee remits the related taxes to the taxing authority. Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if any payment provided for herein would be subject to additional taxes and interest under Code Section 409A and if Indemnitee's receipt of such payment is not delayed until the Section 409A Payment Date, then such payment will not be provided to Indemnitee (or Indemnitee's estate, if applicable) until the Section 409A Payment Date. The "Section 409A Payment Date" is the earlier of (a) the date of Indemnitee's death or (b) the date that is six months and one day after Indemnitee's "separation from service" as defined in Code Section 409A.
Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.
     2. Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, all other terms and conditions of the Indemnity Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Amendment to be executed on the date first indicated above.

News Release
     Fort Worth, Texas, March 2, 2009  Approach Resources Inc. (NASDAQ: AREX) today reported its estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2008 and full year production for 2008. Reserve and production highlights for the year ended December 31, 2008 include:
     At December 31, 2008, proved reserves were composed of 82% natural gas and 18% oil, condensate and NGLs, and had a reserve life index of over 20 years based on 2008 production of 8.8 Bcfe. The proved developed portion of total proved reserves at year end 2008 was 48%, compared to 43% at year end 2007.
     At December 31, 2008, proved reserves in our Cinco Terry field in West Texas totaled 45.9 Bcfe, representing an increase of 150% from 18.3 Bcfe of proved reserves at December 31, 2007. Proved reserves in our Ozona Northeast field in West Texas totaled 144.4 Bcfe, compared to year-end 2007 proved reserves of 140.7 Bcfe. Proved reserves in our North Bald Prairie field in East Texas totaled 20.8 Bcfe, compared to year-end 2007 proved reserves of 21.4 Bcfe.
     J. Ross Craft, Approach's President and CEO, commented, "During 2008, we increased our reserve base primarily through our low-cost and low-risk West Texas development programs. In July 2008, we completed the acquisition of deep rights, additional wellbores and approximately 75 miles of gathering lines and related compression facilities in our Ozona Northeast field. Due to the timing of this strategic acquisition, we redirected a portion of our Ozona Northeast drilling capital to our expanding, multi-pay Cinco Terry project. Throughout 2008, we increased our Cinco Terry acreage position to 45,288 gross (19,466 net) acres, rivaling our Ozona Northeast gross acreage position of 49,169 gross (44,044 net) acres.
     "Given the current commodity price environment and economic uncertainties, we plan to focus on reducing overall costs, increasing the efficiencies of our drilling programs and reducing drilling activity where necessary. Preservation of our financial flexibility will allow Approach to be in a good position to take advantage of potential 2009 drilling and acquisition opportunities."
 
     F&D cost is a non-GAAP measure. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures" below for our definition of F&D costs and a reconciliation to the information required by paragraphs 11 and 21 of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 69.
2008 Proved Reserves
     The following table is a reconciliation of the changes in our proved reserves between December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2008:
     The PV-10, or pre-tax present value of our proved reserves discounted at 10%, was estimated at $221.1 million at year-end 2008, based on year-end weighted average prices of $6.04 per Mcf for natural gas, $39.60 per Bbl for oil and $23.00 per Bbl for NGLs. Our proved reserves and PV-10 estimates are based on an independent engineering study of our oil and gas properties prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton. PV-10 is a non-GAAP measure. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures" below for our definition of PV-10 and a reconciliation of PV-10 to the standardized measure. The standardized measure (GAAP) of discounted future net cash flows for our proved reserves at December 31, 2008 was $142.6 million.
     Total costs incurred for oil and gas properties were $104.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, consisting of $89.2 million for exploration and development drilling and $14.9 million for property acquisitions. Exploration and development costs included $3.5 million in non-cash asset retirement obligations recorded in 2008. The increase in future development costs related to proved reserves from year end 2007 to year end 2008 was $9.5 million.
     Information in this release regarding the standardized measure and costs incurred for oil and gas properties is preliminary and unaudited. Final and audited results will be provided in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, to be filed on or before March 16, 2009.
     The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued new regulations for oil and gas reserve disclosures on December 31, 2008. The new regulations will be effective for Approach's 2009 year-end proved reserve estimates. The SEC's new regulations permit companies to calculate year-end reserve estimates based on commodity prices averaged throughout the year, as opposed to year-end prices. Using prices calculated under the SEC's new rules, our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2008 would have been 224.2 Bcfe, and the PV-10 of those proved reserves at December 31, 2008 would have been $573.5 million, based on 2008 average prices for natural gas, oil and NGLs of $8.91 per Mcf, $101.54 per Bbl and $50.93 per Bbl, respectively.
 
Liquidity and Commodity Derivatives Update
     We have a $200 million revolving credit facility with a $100 million borrowing base, of which $43.5 million and $47.4 million was drawn at December 31, 2008 and February 28, 2009, respectively. Our borrowing base is subject to redetermination during the second quarter of 2009 based on year-end 2008 reserves.
     At December 31, 2008, we had the following commodity derivates positions outstanding:
2008 Expected Impairments
     In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, we review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved and unproved oil and gas properties, accounted for under the successful efforts method of accounting.  As a result of the review of the recoverability of the carrying value of our assets, we expect to report a non-cash impairment charge to unproved oil and gas properties of $6.3 to $6.6 million in 2008.  The expected impairment is related to drilling and completion costs of three wells in Northeast British Columbia and drilling costs of three test wells in Southwest Kentucky. In addition to impairment of unproved oil and gas properties, we expect to write off all of the carrying value of $917,000 related to our equity investment in the Canadian operator of our Northeast British Columbia project.
     The expected impairment charges discussed above are preliminary and unaudited. We will report final impairment charges in our audited financial statements to be included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, to be filed on or before March 16, 2009.
Forward-Looking Statements and Cautionary Statements
     This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures
     This release contains certain financial measures that are non-GAAP measures.  We have provided reconciliations within this release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.  These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP that are presented in this release.
Finding and Development Costs
     are calculated by dividing the sum of exploration costs and development costs for the year, by the total of reserve extensions and discoveries for the year.
Drill-bit finding and development ("F&D") costs
     are calculated by dividing the sum of property acquisition costs, exploration costs and development costs for the year, by the total of reserve extensions, discoveries, purchases and all revisions for the year.
All-in F&D costs, including revisions,
     are calculated by dividing the sum of property acquisition costs, exploration costs, development costs and the change in future development costs from the prior year, by the total of reserve extensions, discoveries, purchases and all revisions for the year.
All-in F&D costs, including revisions and the change in future development costs,
     We believe that providing the above measures of F&D cost is useful to assist an evaluation of how much it costs the Company, on a per Mcfe basis, to add proved reserves. However, these measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our previous SEC filings and to be included in our annual report on Form 10-K to be filed with the SEC on or before March 16, 2009. Due to various factors, including timing differences, F&D costs do not necessarily reflect precisely the costs associated with particular reserves. For example, exploration costs may be recorded in periods before the periods in which related increases in reserves are recorded and development costs may be recorded in periods after the periods in which related increases in
 
reserves are recorded. In addition, changes in commodity prices can affect the magnitude of recorded increases (or decreases) in reserves independent of the related costs of such increases.
     As a result of the above factors and various factors that could materially affect the timing and amounts of future increases in reserves and the timing and amounts of future costs, including factors disclosed in our filings with the SEC, we cannot assure you that the Company's future F&D costs will not differ materially from those set forth above. Further, the methods used by Approach to calculate its F&D costs may differ significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, Approach's F&D costs may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.
     The following table reflects the reconciliation of our estimated finding and development costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 to the information required by paragraphs 11 and 21 of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 69:
 
PV-10
     PV-10 is our estimate of the present value of future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves after deducting estimated production and ad valorem taxes, future capital costs and operating expenses, but before deducting any estimates of future income taxes. The estimated future net revenues are discounted at an annual rate of 10% to determine their "present value." We believe PV-10 to be an important measure for evaluating the relative significance of our oil and gas properties and that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure of PV-10 provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and investors in evaluating oil and gas companies. Because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid, we believe the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable for
 
evaluating the Company. We believe that PV-10 is a financial measure routinely used and calculated similarly by other companies in the oil and gas industry.
     The following table reconciles PV-10 to our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows (the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP). PV-10 should not be considered as an alternative to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as computed under GAAP.
Production Replacement Calculation
     is calculated by dividing net proved reserve additions of 39.4 Bcfe (the sum of extensions and discoveries, purchases and revisions) by production of 8.8 Bcfe. is calculated by dividing extensions and discoveries by production of 8.8 Bcfe. The Company uses production replacement ratios as an indicator of the Company's potential ability to replace annual production volumes and grow its reserves. However, these production replacement ratios have limitations. Theses ratios can vary from year to year for the Company and among other oil and gas companies based on the extent and timing of discoveries and property acquisitions. In addition, since these ratios do not incorporate the cost or timing of future production of new reserves, they should not be used as a measure of value creation.

Table of Contents

Exhibit 99.1
     Fort Worth, Texas, March 10, 2009  Approach Resources Inc. (NASDAQ: AREX) today reported year end and fourth quarter 2008 financial and operating results.
Highlights
     Highlights for the year ended December 31, 2008 (compared to 2007) include:
Year End and Fourth Quarter 2008 Operating Results
     As previously reported, for the year ended December 31, 2008, proved reserves increased 17% to 211.1 Bcfe. At December 31, 2008, proved reserves were composed of 82% natural gas and 18% oil, condensate and NGLs, and had a reserve life index of over 20 years based on 2008 production of 8.8 Bcfe. The proved developed portion of total proved reserves at year end 2008 was 48%, compared to 43% at year end 2007.
     Production for 2008 totaled 8.8 Bcfe (23.9 MMcfe/d), compared to 5.3 Bcfe (14.5 MMcfe/d) produced in 2007, an increase of 65%. 2008 production was 81% natural gas and 19% oil and NGLs, compared to 90% natural gas and 10% oil and NGLs in 2007.
     Production for the fourth quarter 2008 totaled 2.7 Bcfe (28.9 MMcfe/d), compared to 1.6 Bcfe (17.4 MMcfe/d) produced in the fourth quarter 2007, an increase of 66%. Fourth quarter 2008 production was 81% natural gas and 19% oil and NGLs, compared to 89% natural gas and 11% oil and NGLs in the fourth quarter of 2007.
 
Year End 2008 Financial Results
     Net income for 2008 was $23.4 million, or $1.12 per diluted share, on revenues of $79.9 million, compared to net income for 2007 of $2.7 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, on revenues of $39.1 million. Net income for 2008 included the effect of:
     Excluding impairments, an unrealized gain on commodity derivatives and related income taxes, adjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure) for 2008 was $23.5 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, compared to $5.3 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for 2007. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for our reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income.
     EBITDAX (a non-GAAP measure) for 2008 was $63.2 million, or $3.03 per diluted share, compared to $30.4 million, or $2.71 per diluted share, for 2007. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for our reconciliation of EBITDAX to net income.
     Average realized natural gas, oil and NGL prices for 2008, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $8.29 per Mcfe, $93.79 per Bbl and $45.46 per Bbl, respectively, compared to $6.98 per Mcf, $70.31 per Bbl and $46.25 per Bbl for 2007.
     Lease operating expense ("LOE") for 2008 was $7.6 million ($0.87 per Mcfe), compared to $3.8 million ($0.72 per Mcfe) for 2007. The increase in LOE over the prior year was primarily a result of the acquisition of the Neo Canyon 30% working interest and Strawn/Ellenburger deep rights in Ozona Northeast. The increase in 2008 was also attributable to initial startup costs, including compression and treating costs in Cinco Terry and North Bald Prairie, as well as a rise in repair and maintenance costs in Ozona Northeast.
     Severance and production taxes for 2008 were $4.2 million, or 5.3% of oil and gas sales, compared to $1.7 million, or 4.2% of oil and gas sales, in 2007. The increase in severance and production taxes as a percentage of oil and gas sales is due to higher severance tax rates for NGL revenues from Cinco Terry and higher estimated taxes after abatements for newer wells in Ozona Northeast and Cinco Terry.
     Exploration expense in 2008 was $1.5 million, compared to $883,000 in 2007. Exploration expense in 2008 resulted from one dry hole drilled in Ozona Northeast and $965,000 of lease extensions in Ozona Northeast.
     Impairment of non-producing properties for 2008 was $6.4 million, compared to $267,000 in 2007. The 2008 impairment resulted from the write-off of drilling and completion costs of three wells in Northeast British Columbia and drilling costs of three wells in Southwest Kentucky.
     General and administrative expense ("G&A") for 2008 was $8.9 million ($1.01 per Mcfe), compared to $12.7 million ($2.39 per Mcfe) in 2007. We recorded higher G&A expenses in 2007
 
because of certain non-recurring share-based and cash incentive compensation related in part to our initial public offering ("IPO") and other pre-IPO expenses. Increased salaries and benefits related to an increase in staff, professional fees, share-based compensation and cash incentive compensation in 2008 partially offset higher G&A in 2007.
     Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense ("DD&A") for 2008 was $23.7 million ($2.71 per Mcfe), compared to $13.1 million ($2.47 per Mcfe) in 2007. The increase in total DD&A expense was primarily attributable to increased production and higher capital costs, partially offset by an increase in estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2008. The higher DD&A expense per Mcfe was primarily attributable to higher capital costs incurred in North Bald Prairie and reserve revisions in Ozona Northeast at December 31, 2007. In North Bald Prairie, we paid capital costs attributable to the 50% working interest owned by the Company's working interest partner under our carry and earning agreement on the first five wells drilled.
     We recognized an impairment of investment of $917,000 in 2008 relating to the write-off of our equity investment in the Canadian operator of our Northeast British Columbia project.
     Total capital expenditures during 2008 totaled $100.1 million, including $85.4 million for exploration and drilling activities and $14.7 for property acquisitions (including $10.3 million for the acquisition of deep rights in Ozona Northeast).
Fourth Quarter 2008 Results
     Net loss for the fourth quarter 2008 was $152,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, on revenues of $14.7 million, compared to a net loss of $1.8 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, on revenues of $11.7 million for the fourth quarter 2007. Net loss for the fourth quarter 2008 included the effect of a $6.4 million impairment of non-producing properties and $917,000 impairment of investment discussed above, as well as a pre-tax, unrealized gain on commodity derivatives of $3.1 million.
     Excluding impairments, an unrealized gain on commodity derivatives and related income taxes, adjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure) for the fourth quarter 2008 was $2.6 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $614,000, or $0.04 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2007.
     EBITDAX (a non-GAAP measure) for the fourth quarter 2008 was $11.6 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, compared to $7.5 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2007.
     Average realized natural gas, oil and NGL prices for the fourth quarter 2008, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $5.04 per Mcf, $58.00 per Bbl and $21.59 per Bbl, respectively, compared to $6.60 per Mcf, $90.32 per Bbl and $52.29 per Bbl for the fourth quarter 2007.
     LOE for the fourth quarter 2008 was $2.5 million ($0.95 per Mcfe), compared to $1.0 million ($0.65 per Mcfe) in the fourth quarter 2007. The increase in LOE over the prior year quarter was primarily a result of the acquisition of the Neo Canyon 30% working interest and Strawn/Ellenburger deep rights in Ozona Northeast. The increase in 2008 was also attributable to initial startup costs, including compression and treating costs in Cinco Terry and North Bald Prairie, as well as a rise in repair and maintenance costs in Ozona Northeast.
     Severance and production taxes for fourth quarter 2008 were $1.3 million, or 8.9% of oil and gas sales, compared to $511,000, or 4.4% of oil and gas sales, in 2007.
 
     Impairment of non-producing properties for the fourth quarter 2008 was $6.4 million, compared to $267,000 in 2007. The 2008 impairment resulted from the write-off of drilling and completion costs of three wells in Northeast British Columbia and drilling costs of three wells in Southwest Kentucky.
     G&A for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $3.2 million ($1.20 per Mcfe), compared to $8.6 million ($5.36 per Mcfe) in the fourth quarter 2007. We recorded higher G&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2007 because of certain non-recurring share-based and cash incentive compensation related in part to our initial public offering ("IPO") and other pre-IPO expenses. Increased salaries and benefits related to an increase in staff, professional fees, share-based compensation and cash incentive compensation in the fourth quarter of 2008 partially offset higher G&A in the fourth quarter of 2007.
     DD&A for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $7.5 million ($2.80 per Mcfe), compared to $3.9 million ($2.43 per Mcfe) for the prior year quarter. The increase in DD&A was primarily due to increased production and higher capital costs compared to the prior year period, which were partially offset by an increase in the Company's estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2008.
Drilling Operations
     For the year ended December 31, 2008, we drilled or participated in a total of 96.0 (62.5 net) wells, 73.0 (49.5 net) of which had been completed as producers, 10.0 (five net) of which were in various stages of completion at year end and 13.0 (eight net) of which were non-productive. The 10.0 (five net) wells that were waiting on completion at year end have now been completed. In addition, in 2008 we successfully recompleted six (three net) wells in Cinco Terry and six (six net) wells in Ozona Northeast.
     The following table indicates the number of gross and net wells we drilled, participated in or recompleted in our operating areas during 2008:
 
     We currently have two rigs operating, both in Cinco Terry. The term of the contracts on these two rigs will expire on March 31, 2009. Due to current low commodity prices, we have decided not to extend the term of the contracts. We will continue to monitor commodity prices and service costs to determine when we will bring rigs back into the field. We believe that reducing our drilling activity now will preserve our financial flexibility for the long-term and allow Approach to be in a good position to take advantage of potential drilling and acquisition opportunities in 2009 and beyond.
Liquidity and Commodity Derivatives Update
     We have a $200 million revolving credit facility with a $100 million borrowing base, of which $43.5 million and $47.4 million was drawn at December 31, 2008 and February 28, 2009, respectively. Our borrowing base will be redetermined on April 1, 2009 based on year-end 2008 reserves.
 
2009 Guidance Update
     In light of current low commodity prices and our reduced drilling activity, we are revising our 2009 production guidance. We also are revising our severance and production tax guidance. The table below sets forth our revised 2009 financial and operational guidance. Guidance for lease operating, general and administrative and depletion, depreciation and amortization expenses is unchanged from our prior guidance. The 2009 guidance is forward-looking information that is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control, as further described later in this press release.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures
     This release contains certain financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. We have provided reconciliations within this release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP that are presented in this release.
Adjusted Net Income
     This release contains the non-GAAP financial measure adjusted net income, which excludes the following items:
       In accordance with SFAS 144, we reviewed our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved and unproved oil and gas properties, accounted for under the successful efforts method of accounting. As a result of this review of the recoverability of the carrying value of our assets during 2008, we recorded an impairment of non-producing oil and gas properties of $6.4 million. We also recorded an impairment of investment of $917,000 in 2008 relating to our equity investment in the Canadian operator of our Northeast British Columbia project.
     In addition, historically, we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash-flow hedges. We record our open derivative instruments at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as either
 
unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivatives. We record changes in such fair value in earnings on our consolidated statements of operations under "unrealized gain (loss) on commodity derivatives." The unrealized, pre-tax gain on commodity derivatives was $3.1 million and $7.1 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2008, respectively.
     The amounts included in the calculation of adjusted net income below were computed in accordance with GAAP. We believe adjusted net income is useful to investors because it provides readers with a more meaningful measure of our profitability before recording certain items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably determined.
     The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted net income, or net income before the (i) impairment of non-producing properties expense, (ii) impairment of investment expense, (iii) unrealized (gain) loss on commodity derivatives and (iv) the related tax effects, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively (in thousands):
EBITDAX
     EBITDAX is presented herein and reconciled to the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund development and exploration activities. We define EBITDAX as net income, plus (1) exploration expense, (2) impairments of long-lived assets, (3) depletion, depreciation and amortization expense, (4) share-based compensation expense, (5) unrealized loss (gain) on commodity derivatives, (6) interest expense and (7) income taxes. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flow as determined by GAAP. The amounts included in the calculation of EBITDAX were computed in accordance with GAAP.
     Our EBITDAX measure provides additional information that may be used to better understand our operations. EBITDAX is one of several metrics that we use as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income, as an indicator of our operating performance. Certain items excluded from EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost of depreciable assets, none of which are components of EBITDAX. EBITDAX as used by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We believe that EBITDAX is a widely followed measure of operating performance and is one of many metrics used by our management team and by other readers of the Company's consolidated financial statements. For example, EBITDAX can be used to assess our operating performance and return on capital in comparison to other independent exploration and production companies without regard to financial or capital structure, and to assess the financial performance of the Company without regard to capital structure or historical cost basis.
 
          The following table provides a reconciliation of net income to EBITDAX (in thousands):

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2.):

Soliciting material pursuant to Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14a-12)

(e) Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
     On March 26, 2009, the Compensation and Nominating Committee (the "Committee") and Board of Directors of Approach Resources Inc. (the "Company") approved a performance-based, non-equity incentive award program for executive officers for 2009 (the "2009 Incentive Program"). The 2009 Incentive Program currently applies to the five named executive officers to be included in the summary compensation table of the Company's 2009 proxy statement and will be described therein.
     Awards under the 2009 Incentive Program ("Performance Awards") are made pursuant to the Company's 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2007 Plan"). Performance Awards are determined as a percentage of an executive officer's annual base salary and paid to the executive officer upon the achievement of Company-wide performance targets in five categories, plus one individual performance category, subject to the Committee's discretion to reduce payout amounts as described in the penultimate paragraph of this Item 5.02(e).
     The Committee established a minimum, or "threshold," and maximum, or "excellent," performance target for each performance category. The Company is required to reach the threshold target in a performance category before a participant receives any credit for such category in the calculation of his Performance Award. If the Company exceeds the threshold level for a performance category, the amount of the Performance Award attributable to that category is capped at the excellent level. If actual results fall between the threshold and maximum performance levels, then the percentile performance used to determine the payout percentage is proportionally adjusted.
     The six performance categories established with respect to the Performance Awards for 2009 are shown in the table below, together with the target levels of achievement with respect to each category (except individual performance) and the relative weight assigned to each category. Five of the performance categories are Company-wide performance measures and the sixth category (individual performance) is personal to each executive and discretionary for the Committee.
     In addition to selecting the performance categories discussed above, the Committee approved the Performance Award targets (expressed as a percentage of annual salary) for each of the Company's named executive officers, as set forth in the table below. For 2009, the Performance Award amount payable to each named executive officer will be based upon the Company's performance in the five company-wide performance categories and the individual performance of each named executive officer. The annual incentive payout percentage will be the sum of the percentage performance results
 
calculated for each performance category. The actual performance payout amounts for each category are graduated between each performance target in accordance with a predetermined formula that measures performance on a linear, pro-rata basis between the threshold and excellent levels.
     The Committee cannot increase payout amounts under the 2009 Incentive Program. The Committee can, however, in its reasonable discretion, reduce the payout amounts under the program after taking into account special or unusual factors that may have contributed to the achievement of target performance measures such as acquisitions, commodity prices or other such factors deemed appropriate by the Committee.
     The foregoing description of Performance Awards granted pursuant to the 2007 Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the 2007 Plan, which is filed as Exhibit 10.6 to the Company's registration statement on Form S-1 filed July 12, 2007.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

     On March 31, 2009, Approach Resources Inc. (the "Company") filed a Current Report on Form 8-K dated March 26, 2009 (the "Original Form 8-K"). The Original Form 8-K included a table with six performance categories established for the Company's 2009 Incentive Program (defined below), together with the target levels of achievement for each category (except individual performance) and the relative weight assigned to each category. The Company is filing this amendment to the Original Form 8-K to correct the "excellent" target amount for the EBITDAX per share growth performance category. Item 5.02 of the Original Form 8-K is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as set forth below.
(e) Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
      On March 26, 2009, the Compensation and Nominating Committee (the "Committee") and Board of Directors of Approach Resources Inc. (the "Company") approved a performance-based, non-equity incentive award program for executive officers for 2009 (the "2009 Incentive Program"). The 2009 Incentive Program currently applies to the five named executive officers to be included in the summary compensation table of the Company's 2009 proxy statement and will be described therein.
     Awards under the 2009 Incentive Program ("Performance Awards") are made pursuant to the Company's 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2007 Plan"). Performance Awards are determined as a percentage of an executive officer's annual base salary and paid to the executive officer upon the achievement of Company-wide performance targets in five categories, plus one individual performance category, subject to the Committee's discretion to reduce payout amounts as described in the penultimate paragraph of this Item 5.02(e).
     The Committee established a minimum, or "threshold," and maximum, or "excellent," performance target for each performance category. The Company is required to reach the threshold target in a performance category before a participant receives any credit for such category in the calculation of his Performance Award. If the Company exceeds the threshold level for a performance category, the amount of the Performance Award attributable to that category is capped at the excellent level. If actual results fall between the threshold and maximum performance levels, then the percentile performance used to determine the payout percentage is proportionally adjusted.
     The six performance categories established with respect to the Performance Awards for 2009 are shown in the table below, together with the target levels of achievement with respect to each category (except individual performance) and the relative weight assigned to each category. Five of the performance categories are Company-wide performance measures and the sixth category (individual performance) is personal to each executive and discretionary for the Committee.
 
     In addition to selecting the performance categories discussed above, the Committee approved the Performance Award targets (expressed as a percentage of annual salary) for each of the Company's named executive officers, as set forth in the table below. For 2009, the Performance Award amount payable to each named executive officer will be based upon the Company's performance in the five company-wide performance categories and the individual performance of each named executive officer. The annual incentive payout percentage will be the sum of the percentage performance results calculated for each performance category. The actual performance payout amounts for each category are graduated between each performance target in accordance with a predetermined formula that measures performance on a linear, pro-rata basis between the threshold and excellent levels.
     The Committee cannot increase payout amounts under the 2009 Incentive Program. The Committee can, however, in its reasonable discretion, reduce the payout amounts under the program after taking into account special or unusual factors that may have contributed to the achievement of target performance measures such as acquisitions, commodity prices or other such factors deemed appropriate by the Committee.
     The foregoing description of Performance Awards granted pursuant to the 2007 Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the 2007 Plan, which is filed as Exhibit 10.6 to the Company's registration statement on Form S-1 filed July 12, 2007.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
News Release
     Fort Worth, Texas, May 5, 2009  Approach Resources Inc. (NASDAQ: AREX) today reported first quarter 2009 financial and operating results.
Highlights
     Highlights for the first quarter of 2009 (compared to first quarter of 2008) include:
First Quarter 2009 Results
     Production for the first quarter of 2009 totaled 2.5 Bcfe (28.1 MMcfe/d), compared to 2.0 Bcfe (21.7 MMcfe/d) produced in the first quarter of 2008, an increase of 28%. First quarter of 2009 production was 70% natural gas and 30% oil and NGLs, compared to 84% natural gas and 16% oil and NGLs in the first quarter of 2008.
     Revenues for the first quarter of 2009 totaled $10.1 million, compared to revenues of $19 million for the first quarter of 2008. Revenues for the first quarter of 2009 were negatively impacted by a sharp decline in realized commodity prices over the prior year quarter. Average realized natural gas, oil and NGL prices for the first quarter of 2009, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $3.73 per Mcf, $34.37 per Bbl and $20.99 per Bbl, respectively, versus $8.93 per Mcf, $97.91 per Bbl and $50.95 per Bbl, respectively, for the first quarter of 2008. The Company's average realized price, including the effect of commodity derivatives, was $5.24 per Mcfe for the first quarter of 2009, compared to $9.64 per Mcfe for the first quarter of 2008, a decrease of 46%. Of the $8.9 million decrease in revenues, approximately $11.3 million was attributable to a decrease in oil and gas prices, which was partially offset by approximately $2.4 million attributable to an increase in production from Cinco Terry.
 
     Net income for the first quarter of 2009 was $868,000, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to net income of $2.8 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2008. Net income for the first quarter of 2009 included a pre-tax, unrealized gain on commodity derivatives of $2.1 million. Excluding the unrealized gain on commodity derivatives and related income taxes, adjusted net (loss) income (a non-GAAP measure) for the first quarter of 2009 was a loss of $548,000, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $5.9 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2008. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of adjusted net (loss) income to net income.
     In addition to lower realized commodity prices, net income and adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2009 were negatively impacted by an increase in our effective income tax rate to 63.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2009, as described in more detail below.
     EBITDAX (a non-GAAP measure) for the first quarter of 2009 was $8.3 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to $15.2 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2008. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of EBITDAX to net income.
     Lease operating expenses ("LOE") for the first quarter of 2009 were $2.4 million ($0.94 per Mcfe), compared to $1.4 million ($0.71 per Mcfe) in the first quarter of 2008. The increase in LOE over the prior year period was primarily a result of increased activities in our Cinco Terry field. Initial compression was installed in Cinco Terry during the first quarter of 2008 and has increased as a result of additional facilities required to compress and treat the natural gas produced from Cinco Terry. Compression and treating costs also included higher repair and maintenance costs attributable to the compression and treating facilities in both Cinco Terry and Ozona Northeast. In addition, the increase in LOE during the three months ended March 31, 2009 was partially attributable to a rise in estimated ad valorem taxes and actual well-related repair and maintenance costs. We do not expect the level of LOE for the balance of 2009 to differ materially from the first quarter of 2009.
     Severance and production taxes for first quarter of 2009 were $430,000, or 4.3% of oil and gas sales, compared to $753,000, or 4.0% of oil and gas sales, in the first quarter of 2008.
     General and administrative ("G&A") expenses for the first quarter of 2009 were $2.8 million ($1.11 per Mcfe), compared to $1.9 million ($0.98 per Mcfe) in the first quarter of 2008. Higher G&A expenses in the first quarter of 2009 were due to higher share-based compensation resulting from timing of payment of 2009 annual director fees, as well as higher salaries and related employee benefit costs attributable to our increase in staff from the prior year period. Except for $377,000 in non-cash, share-based compensation expense for 2009 annual director fees incurred in the first quarter of 2009, we do not expect the level of G&A expenses for the balance of 2009 to differ materially from the first quarter of 2009.
     Depletion, depreciation and amortization ("DD&A") expenses for the first quarter of 2009 were $6.9 million ($2.74 per Mcfe), compared to $5.2 million ($2.64 per Mcfe) for the prior year quarter. The increase in DD&A expenses was primarily due to increased production and higher capital costs, partially offset by an increase in our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2008.
     Our income tax provision was $1.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008. Our effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was 63.7%, compared with 35% for the three months ended March 31, 2008. The increase in the effective rate resulted primarily from a change in our estimated income tax expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008, along with an increased impact of permanent differences between book and taxable income and increased effective state income tax rates. We expect the effective income tax rate to be approximately 39% for the remainder of 2009.
 
Capital Expenditures and Drilling Operations
     Capital expenditures for drilling and development in the first quarter of 2009 totaled $13.2 million, and included the completion of 10 gross (five net) wells that were waiting on completion at December 31, 2008. During the first quarter of 2009, we drilled a total of 13 (6.5 net) wells in Cinco Terry, four (two net) of which were completed as producers, seven (3.5 net) of which were in various stages of completion at March 31, 2009 and two (one net) of which were non-productive. Our estimated average daily net production for the month of April 2009 was 25.7 MMcfe/d. Production for the month of April 2009 was negatively impacted by partial curtailment over approximately four days in Ozona Northeast due to scheduled maintenance at a downstream NGL fractionation facility.
     As previously announced, due to the continued weakness in commodity prices, we did not extend the contracts for our two remaining drilling rigs after March 31, 2009, and we released these rigs during the first week of April 2009. We currently expect that our capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2009 could range from $15 million to $25 million. We intend to fund our 2009 capital expenditures with internally-generated cash flow, with any excess cash flow applied to debt, working capital obligations or strategic acquisitions. Our capital expenditure budget is subject to change depending upon a number of factors, including economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and gas, the results of our development and exploration efforts, the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and other participants for drilling prospects, our financial results, the availability of leases on reasonable terms and our ability to obtain permits for the drilling locations.
Recent Acreage Acquisition
     In April 2009, we acquired an additional 2,702 gross (1,396 net) acres of leasehold interests adjacent to our Cinco Terry field in Crockett County, Texas through The University of Texas System's April lease sale process. We believe the acreage is prospective for Ellenburger and Canyon Sands production. This purchase, plus additional purchases made during the first quarter of 2009, expands our Cinco Terry project to a total of 50,226 gross (20,994 net) acres.
Liquidity and Commodity Derivatives Update
     We have a $200 million revolving credit facility with a $100 million borrowing base, of which $47.7 million and $47 million were drawn at March 31, 2009 and April 30, 2009, respectively. As previously announced, our borrowing base was reaffirmed on April 1, 2009 based on our 2008 year-end estimated proved reserves of 211.1 Bcfe.
     As of April 30, 2009, we had the following commodity derivatives positions outstanding:
 
Management Comments
     J. Ross Craft, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "During the first quarter of 2009, our production increased 28% compared to the first quarter of 2008, and production from our Cinco Terry field increased 220% compared to the first quarter of 2008. Cinco Terry is driving our oil and NGL production as well, which increased 140% from the prior year period. Our production growth, however, was offset by the steep decline in commodity prices. Despite the prevailing commodity price environment, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter of 2009, our long-term debt-to-capital ratio was just 17%. During this time of suppressed commodity prices, we intend to focus on paying down our debt and evaluating opportunities that emphasize our expertise and can create long-term value for our stockholders."

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures
     This release contains certain financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. We have provided reconciliations within this release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures here and on the Non-GAAP Financial Information page in the Investor Relations section of our website at .
www.approachresources.com
Adjusted Net Income
     This release contains the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share, which exclude the unrealized, pre-tax gain or loss on commodity derivatives and related income taxes.
     The amounts included in the calculation of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share below were computed in accordance with GAAP. We believe adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share are useful to investors because they provide readers with a more meaningful measure of our profitability before recording certain items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably determined. However, these measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
     The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively (in thousands, except per-share metrics):
 
EBITDAX
     We define EBITDAX as net income, plus (1) exploration expense, (2) depletion, depreciation and amortization expense, (3) share-based compensation expense, (4) unrealized (gain) loss on commodity derivatives, (5) interest expense and (6) income taxes. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flow as determined by GAAP. The amounts included in the calculation of EBITDAX were computed in accordance with GAAP. EBITDAX is presented herein and reconciled to the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund development and exploration activities. This measure is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
     The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDAX to net income for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively (in thousands, except per-share metrics):
Long-Term Debt-to-Capital Ratio
     Long-term debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as of March 31, 2009, and by dividing long-term debt (GAAP) of $47.7 million by the sum of total stockholders' equity (GAAP) and long-term debt of $273 million. We use the long-term debt-to-capital ratio as a measurement of our overall financial leverage. However, this ratio has limitations. This ratio can vary from year to year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the ratio on a company's financial statements. This ratio is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.

Exhibit 99.1
News Release
     Fort Worth, Texas, August 4, 2009  Approach Resources Inc. (NASDAQ: AREX) today reported second quarter 2009 financial and operating results.
Highlights
     Highlights for the second quarter of 2009 (compared to second quarter of 2008) include:
Second Quarter 2009 Results
     Production for the second quarter of 2009 totaled 2.3 Bcfe (25.1 MMcfe/d), compared to 2.0 Bcfe (22.4 MMcfe/d) produced in the second quarter of 2008, an increase of 12%. Production decreased 10% in the second quarter of 2009, compared to first quarter 2009 production of 2.5 Bcfe. Second quarter 2009 production was 71% natural gas and 29% oil and NGLs, compared to 82% natural gas and 18% oil and NGLs in the second quarter of 2008.
     Revenues for the second quarter of 2009 totaled $9.9 million, compared to revenues of $24.1 million for the second quarter of 2008. Revenues for the second quarter of 2009 were negatively impacted by a sharp decline in realized commodity prices over the prior year quarter. Average realized natural gas, oil and NGL prices for the second quarter of 2009, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $3.28 per Mcf, $55.60 per Bbl and $26.84 per Bbl, respectively, versus $11.10 per Mcf, $121.29 per Bbl and $53.93 per Bbl, respectively, for the second quarter of 2008. The Company's average realized price, including the effect of commodity derivatives, was $6.30 per Mcfe for the second quarter of 2009, compared to $11.59 per Mcfe for the second quarter of 2008, a decrease of 46%. Of the
 
$14.2 million decrease in revenues, approximately $16.0 million was attributable to a decrease in oil and gas prices, which was partially offset by approximately $1.8 million attributable to an increase in production from Cinco Terry.
     Net loss for the second quarter of 2009 was $671,000, or $(0.03) per diluted share, compared to net income of $928,000, or $0.04 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2008. Net loss for the second quarter of 2009 included a pre-tax, unrealized loss on commodity derivatives of $4.3 million.
     Excluding the unrealized loss on commodity derivatives and related income taxes, adjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure) for the second quarter of 2009 was $2.2 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $7.3 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2008. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income.
     EBITDAX (a non-GAAP measure) for the second quarter of 2009 was $10.2 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, compared to $19.0 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2008. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of EBITDAX to net income.
     Lease operating expenses ("LOE") for the second quarter of 2009 were $1.8 million ($0.77 per Mcfe), compared to $1.9 million ($0.91 per Mcfe) in the second quarter of 2008. The decrease in LOE over the prior year period was due in part to lower expenses related to well repair and maintenance costs as well as a $235,000 reduction of our estimated ad valorem tax accrual for the three months ended March 31, 2009, which we recognized during the second quarter of 2009.
     Severance and production taxes for the second quarter of 2009 were $507,000, or 5.1% of oil and gas sales, compared to $1.2 million, or 4.8% of oil and gas sales, in the second quarter of 2008.
     General and administrative ("G&A") expenses for the second quarter of 2009 were $2.2 million ($0.98 per Mcfe), compared to $1.8 million ($0.89 per Mcfe) for the second quarter of 2008. The increase in G&A expenses was principally due to increased staffing, share-based compensation and an increase in franchise taxes partially due to the timing of payment compared to 2008.
     Depletion, depreciation and amortization ("DD&A") expenses for the second quarter of 2009 were $6.2 million ($2.73 per Mcfe), compared to $6.0 million ($2.93 per Mcfe) for the second quarter of 2008. The decrease in DD&A expenses per Mcfe was primarily attributable to an increase in our estimated proved reserves partially offset by an increase in production over the prior year quarter.
     Our income tax benefit was $460,000 for the second quarter of 2009. Our provision for income taxes was $804,000 for the second quarter of 2008. Our effective income tax rate for the second quarter of 2009 was 40.7%, compared with 46.4% for the second quarter of 2008.
Capital Expenditures and Drilling Operations
     Capital expenditures for drilling and development in the second quarter of 2009 totaled $3.1 million, and included the completion of seven gross (3.5 net) wells that were waiting on completion at March 31, 2009, all of which were completed as producers. Our estimated average daily net production for the month of July 2009 was 22.8 MMcfe/d.
     As previously announced, due to the continued weakness in commodity prices, we did not extend the contracts for our two remaining drilling rigs after March 31, 2009, and we released these rigs during the first week of April 2009. We currently expect that our capital expenditures for the year ending
 
December 31, 2009 will not exceed $25 million. We intend to fund our 2009 capital expenditures with internally-generated cash flows, with any excess cash flows applied to debt, working capital obligations or strategic acquisitions. Our capital expenditure budget is subject to change depending upon a number of factors, including economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and gas, the results of our development and exploration efforts, the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and other participants for drilling prospects, our financial results, the availability of leases on reasonable terms and our ability to obtain permits for the drilling locations.
Liquidity and Commodity Derivatives Update
     We have a $200 million revolving credit facility with a $100 million borrowing base, of which $46.2 million and $42.9 million were drawn at June 30, 2009 and July 31, 2009, respectively. As of June 30, 2009, our long-term debt-to-capital ratio (a non-GAAP measure) was 17%. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our definition of "long-term debt-to-capital ratio."
     As of July 31, 2009, we had the following commodity derivatives positions outstanding:
Management Comments
     J. Ross Craft, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented "The significant decline in natural gas prices continued to affect our revenues and net income during the second quarter of 2009. We do not anticipate an appreciable improvement in natural gas pricing for the remainder of 2009 and have increased our 2010 hedge position through two fixed price swaps with an average price of $6.13 per MMBtu. However, we remain positive on the long-term outlook for natural gas, a clean, abundant fuel source.
     "We continue to be a low-cost operator and have implemented several cost-saving measures in the field that contributed to a reduction in operating expenses over both the prior-year quarter and the past quarter. The reduction in operating expenses, along with the continued reduction in service costs, helped offset current commodity prices. We plan to resume our Cinco Terry drilling program, where we can benefit from higher oil and natural gas liquids production, during the fourth quarter of 2009. We have restarted the permitting process for a 106-square mile 3-D seismic shoot over Cinco Terry and expect data collection to begin in January 2010. When completed, we should be able to high grade Ellenburger, Canyon and Wolfcamp targets. We also continue to focus on optimizing our Ozona Northeast asset base through low-cost, high-return projects. We have identified several Strawn and Ellenburger deepening projects as a result of our reprocessed 3-D seismic data and are currently on our first well of a four-well test program."

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures
     This release contains certain financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. We have provided reconciliations within this release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures here and on the Non-GAAP Financial Information page in the Investor Relations section of our website at .
www.approachresources.com
Adjusted Net Income
     This release contains the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share, which exclude the unrealized, pre-tax loss on commodity derivatives and related income taxes.
     The amounts included in the calculation of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share below were computed in accordance with GAAP. We believe adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share are useful to investors because they provide readers with a more meaningful measure of our profitability before recording certain items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably determined. However, these measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
     The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted net income to net (loss) income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively (in thousands, except per-share metrics):
 
EBITDAX
     We define EBITDAX as net (loss) income, plus (1) exploration expense, (2) depletion, depreciation and amortization expense, (3) share-based compensation expense, (4) unrealized loss on commodity derivatives, (5) interest expense and (6) income taxes. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flow as determined by GAAP. The amounts included in the calculation of EBITDAX were computed in accordance with GAAP. EBITDAX is presented herein and reconciled to the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund development and exploration activities. This measure is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
     The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDAX to net (loss) income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively (in thousands, except per-share metrics):
Long-Term Debt-to-Capital Ratio
     Long-term debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as of June 30, 2009, and by dividing long-term debt (GAAP) of $46.2 million by the sum of total stockholders' equity (GAAP) and long-term debt (GAAP) of $271.3 million. We use the long-term debt-to-capital ratio as a measurement of our overall financial leverage. However, this ratio has limitations. This ratio can vary from year to year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the ratio on a company's financial statements. This ratio is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On October 14, 2009, Approach Oil & Gas Inc. (the "Company"), a subsidiary of Approach Resources Inc., entered into an amendment (the "Amendment") to its Oil & Gas Lease dated February 27, 2007 (the "Lease") that covers the Company's El Vado East prospect in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico. The effective date of the Amendment is January 1, 2009.
     The Amendment provides that if the Company is prevented from complying with any covenant of the Lease due to, among other things, governmental or regulatory order or regulation or by failure to obtain permits, then the primary term of the Lease will be extended and all dates, deadlines, provisions and covenants in the Lease will be extended during the period of force majeure or delay, provided that the Company gives written notice to the mineral lessor. The period of force majeure may not exceed four consecutive years after the expiration of the primary term or recurring periods of four years in the aggregate past the primary term in the event of litigation, injuction, restraining order, governmental or regulatory order or by failure to obtain permits and two years for all other causes.
     The Amendment also amends the continuous drilling provisions of the Lease to provide that if, at the expiration of the primary term or any extensions, the Company is engaged in drilling or has drilled a producing well or a dry hole during the primary term as extended, then the termination provisions of the Lease will be extended so long as at least two wells are drilled and completed or plugged and abandoned at any time during each lease year following the expiration of the primary term.
     The foregoing description of the terms of the Amendment is qualified in its entirety by the Amendment, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this current report and is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
News Release
     Fort Worth, Texas, November 3, 2009  Approach Resources Inc. (NASDAQ: AREX) today reported third quarter 2009 financial and operating results.
Highlights
     Highlights for the third quarter of 2009 (compared to third quarter of 2008) include:
Third Quarter 2009 Results
     Production for the third quarter of 2009 totaled 2.0 Bcfe (21.8 MMcfe/d), compared to 2.1 Bcfe (22.6 MMcfe/d) produced in the third quarter of 2008, a decrease of 3.7%. Production decreased 12.2% in the third quarter of 2009, compared to second quarter 2009 production of 2.3 Bcfe (25.1 MMcfe/d) due to decreased drilling activity and the natural decline of our tight gas fields. Third quarter 2009 production was 75% natural gas and 25% oil and NGLs, compared to 76% natural gas and 24% oil and NGLs in the third quarter of 2008.
     Revenues for the third quarter of 2009 totaled $8.8 million, compared to revenues of $22 million for the third quarter of 2008. Revenues for the third quarter of 2009 were negatively impacted by a sharp decline in realized commodity prices over the prior year quarter. Average realized natural gas, oil and NGL prices for the third quarter of 2009, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $3.32 per Mcf, $63.49 per Bbl and $29.72 per Bbl, respectively, compared to $9.10 per Mcf, $110.61 per Bbl and $56.64 per Bbl, respectively, for the third quarter of 2008. The Company's average realized price, including the effect of commodity derivatives, was $6.52 per Mcfe for the third quarter of 2009, compared to $10.49
 
per Mcfe for the third quarter of 2008, a decrease of 37.8%. Of the $13.2 million decrease in revenues, approximately $12.5 million was attributable to a decrease in oil and gas prices and approximately $749,000 was attributable to a reduction in production volumes.
     Net loss for the third quarter of 2009 was $3.1 million, or $(0.15) per diluted share, compared to net income of $19.8 million, or $0.95 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2008. Net loss for the third quarter of 2009 included a pre-tax, unrealized loss on commodity derivatives of $6.4 million.
     Excluding the unrealized loss on commodity derivatives and related income taxes, adjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure) for the third quarter of 2009 was $1.1 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $7.6 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2008. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income.
     EBITDAX (a non-GAAP measure) for the third quarter of 2009 was $8.9 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to $17.4 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2008. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of EBITDAX to net income.
     Lease operating expenses ("LOE") for the third quarter of 2009 were $1.9 million ($0.95 per Mcfe), compared to $1.8 million ($0.89 per Mcfe) in the third quarter of 2008. The increase in LOE per Mcfe over the prior year period was due primarily to increases in pumping and supervision, well related repairs and maintenance, compression and water hauling, certain of which are fixed costs, partially offset by lower ad valorem taxes and workover expenses.
     Severance and production taxes for the third quarter of 2009 were $455,000, or 5.2% of oil and gas sales, compared to $1 million, or 4.4% of oil and gas sales, in the third quarter of 2008. The decrease in production taxes was a function of the decrease in oil and gas sales between the two periods.
     Exploration expense for the third quarter of 2009 was $534,000, which resulted primarily from the expiration of leases for approximately 2,300 net acres in our Ozona Northeast and North Bald Prairie fields. We expect to re-lease substantially all of the expired acreage. We recorded no exploration expense for the third quarter of 2008.
     General and administrative ("G&A") expenses for the third quarter of 2009 were $2.2 million ($1.12 per Mcfe), compared to $1.9 million ($0.92 per Mcfe) for the third quarter of 2008. The increase in G&A expenses was principally due to increased staffing and share-based compensation.
     Depletion, depreciation and amortization ("DD&A") expenses for the third quarter of 2009 were $5.6 million ($2.79 per Mcfe), compared to $5 million ($2.41 per Mcfe) for the third quarter of 2008. The increase in DD&A expense was primarily attributable to an increase in capitalized costs, partially offset by a decrease in production over the prior year quarter.
     Our income taxes decreased $11.8 million to a benefit of $1.4 million for the third quarter of 2009, from a provision of $10.4 million for the third quarter of 2008. The decrease in income tax provision was due to the decrease in our income before taxes. Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2009 was 30.5%, compared with 34.4% for the third quarter of 2008. The decrease in the effective tax rate relates primarily to the increased impact of permanent differences between book and taxable income.
 
Capital Expenditures, Liquidity and Commodity Derivatives Update
     Capital expenditures for drilling and development in the third quarter of 2009 totaled $2.7 million, and included the drilling of one gross (0.5 net) well in Cinco Terry that was completed during the fourth quarter of 2009 as a producer as well as deepening and recompleting wells in Cinco Terry and Ozona Northeast. Our estimated average daily net production for the month of October 2009 was 21.1 MMcfe/d.
     At September 30, 2009, we had a $200 million revolving credit facility with a $100 million borrowing base, of which $36.9 million and $35.8 million were drawn at September 30, 2009 and October 31, 2009, respectively. As of September 30, 2009, our long-term debt-to-capital ratio (a non-GAAP measure) was 14%. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our definition of "long-term debt-to-capital ratio."
     As of September 30, 2009, we had the following commodity derivatives positions outstanding:
     After September 30, 2009, we entered into a NYMEX  Henry Hub price swap at $6.36 per MMBtu for 100,000 MMBtu per month for 2010.
Borrowing Base Increase
     Effective October 30, 2009, the Company's lending group increased the Company's $100 million borrowing base to $115 million under the Company's revolving credit facility. All other terms and conditions of the credit facility remain unchanged. The credit facility is provided by The Frost National Bank, as agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, Fortis Capital Corp. and KeyBank. The next redetermination of the borrowing base is scheduled for April 2010. The revolving credit facility matures July 31, 2011.
Management Comments
     J. Ross Craft, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Releasing our rigs after the first quarter of 2009 helped us reduce our long-term debt from $47.7 million at March 31, 2009 to $36.9 million at September 30, 2009. Releasing our rigs, however, also contributed to a decrease in our average daily production in 2009, as we elected not to offset the natural decline of our tight gas fields in an unfavorable natural gas price environment. Given current, higher natural gas prices, we now have resumed drilling operations in Cinco Terry and plan to resume drilling in Ozona Northeast this month. Our drilling and development program for the remainder of 2009 and 2010 reflects our commitment to long-term growth by drilling in our low-risk, low-cost, core development areas."

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures
     This release contains certain financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. We have provided reconciliations within this release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures here and on the Non-GAAP Financial Information page in the Investor Relations section of our website at .
www.approachresources.com
Adjusted Net Income
     This release contains the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share, which exclude the unrealized, pre-tax loss (gain) on commodity derivatives and related income taxes.
     The amounts included in the calculation of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share below were computed in accordance with GAAP. We believe adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share are useful to investors because they provide readers with a more meaningful measure of our profitability before recording certain items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably determined. However, these measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
     The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted net income to net (loss) income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively (in thousands, except per-share metrics):
 
EBITDAX
     We define EBITDAX as net (loss) income, plus (1) exploration expense, (2) depletion, depreciation and amortization expense, (3) share-based compensation expense, (4) unrealized loss (gain) on commodity derivatives, (5) interest expense and (6) income taxes. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flow as determined by GAAP. The amounts included in the calculation of EBITDAX were computed in accordance with GAAP. EBITDAX is presented herein and reconciled to the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund development and exploration activities. This measure is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
     The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDAX to net (loss) income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively (in thousands, except per-share metrics):
Long-Term Debt-to-Capital Ratio
     Long-term debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as of September 30, 2009, and by dividing long-term debt (GAAP) of $36.9 million by the sum of total stockholders' equity (GAAP) and long-term debt (GAAP) of $259.4 million. We use the long-term debt-to-capital ratio as a measurement of our overall financial leverage. However, this ratio has limitations. This ratio can vary from year to year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the ratio on a company's financial statements. This ratio is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.

Exhibit 99.2
News Release
     Fort Worth, Texas, November 3, 2009  Approach Resources Inc. (NASDAQ: AREX) today provided an update regarding 2009 drilling activity and guidance and 2010 capital budget and guidance.
2009 Drilling Activity and Guidance Update
     The Company has resumed drilling and currently is operating two rigs in Cinco Terry. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company plans to drill 11 gross (5.5 net) wells in Cinco Terry. We also have begun our previously announced 3-D seismic operations in Cinco Terry. We plan to move one rig into Ozona Northeast in November 2009 and drill four gross (four net) wells before year end. Given the anticipated increase in activity during the remainder of 2009, we expect that our capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2009, including these projects but excluding any acquisitions, will not exceed $30 million. The Company expects to fund remaining 2009 capital expenditures with internally-generated cash flows. The 2009 capital budget is subject to change depending upon a number of factors, including economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and gas, the results of our development and exploration efforts, the availability of sufficient capital resources for drilling prospects, our financial results, the availability of leases on reasonable terms and our ability to obtain permits for the drilling locations.
     The table below sets forth the Company's revised 2009 financial and operational guidance. Guidance for lease operating, severance and production taxes and depletion, depreciation and amortization expenses is unchanged from prior guidance. The 2009 guidance is forward-looking information that is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control, as further described later in this press release.
 
2010 Capital Budget and Guidance
     The Company's Board of Directors has approved a 2010 capital budget for exploration and development expenditures of up to $53 million. The budget assumes commodity prices average $6.05 per Mcf of natural gas, $77.50 per Bbl of oil and $36.45 per Bbl of natural gas liquids. The budget provides for the Company to operate two rigs in Cinco Terry and one rig in Ozona Northeast until mid-year 2010, when we plan to operate four rigs in Cinco Terry and two rigs in Ozona Northeast.
     The Company intends to fund 2010 capital expenditures, excluding any acquisitions, primarily out of internally-generated cash flows and, as necessary, borrowings under its credit facility. We anticipate allocating a substantial portion of the capital budget to our core areas of operation in West Texas:
     The table below sets forth the Company's 2010 financial and operational guidance. The 2010 guidance is forward-looking information that is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control, as further described later in this press release.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 2200 Ross Avenue, Third Floor Dallas, Texas 75201 Attention: Kimberly A. Bourgeois
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     Reference is hereby made to that certain Credit Agreement dated as of January 18, 2008 among Approach Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Borrower"), the Frost National Bank, as Agent ("Agent"), and the Lenders that are signatory parties hereto (the "Lenders"), as amended by letter amendment dated as of February 19, 2008, letter amendment dated as of May 6, 2008, Third Amendment dated as of August 26, 2008, Fourth Amendment dated as of April 8, 2009, Fifth Amendment dated as of July 8, 2009, Sixth Amendment dated as of October 30, 2009 and this Seventh Amendment dated the date hereof (as amended, the "Loan Agreement"). All capitalized terms herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Loan Agreement.
     Pursuant to this Seventh Amendment (the "Amendment"), Agent, Lenders and Borrower agree, effective as of the date hereof, to amend the Loan Agreement according to the terms and provisions set forth below.
 
"(c) . On the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, either Agent or The Frost National Bank (each an "Issuing Bank") shall from time to time during the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on the Maturity Date upon request of Borrower, issue standby and/or commercial letters of credit for the account of Borrower or any Guarantor (the "Letters of Credit") in such face amounts as Borrower may request, but not to exceed in the aggregate face amount at any time outstanding ten percent (10%) of the Borrowing Base then in effect. The face amount of all Letters of Credit issued and outstanding hereunder shall be considered as advances on the Commitment for Borrowing Base purposes and all payments made by an Issuing Bank on such Letters of Credit shall be considered as Advances under the Notes. Each Letter of Credit issued for the account of Borrower or any Guarantor hereunder shall (i) be in favor of such beneficiaries as specifically requested by Borrower, (ii) have an expiration date not exceeding the earlier of (a) one year or (b) the Maturity Date, (iii) be in a minimum amount of $25,000.00 and (iv) contain such other terms and provisions as may be reasonably required by Issuing Bank. Each Lender (other than Issuing Bank) agrees that, upon issuance of any Letter of Credit hereunder, it shall automatically acquire a participation in Issuing Bank's liability under such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such liability, and each Lender (other than Issuing Bank) thereby shall absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably assume, as primary obligor and not as surety, and shall be unconditionally obligated to agent to pay and discharge when due, its Commitment Percentage of Issuing Bank's liability under such Letter of Credit. Borrower hereby unconditionally agrees to pay and reimburse Issuing Bank for the amount of each demand for payment under any Letter of Credit that is in substantial compliance with the provisions of any such Letter of Credit at or prior to the date on which payment is to be made by Issuing Bank to the beneficiary
Letters of Credit
 
thereunder, without presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind. Upon receipt from any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any demand for payment under such Letter of Credit, Issuing Bank shall promptly notify Agent (if Agent is not the Issuing Bank) Borrower of the demand and the date upon which such payment is to be made by Issuing Bank to such beneficiary in respect of such demand. Upon receipt of such notice from Issuing Bank, Borrower shall advise Agent and Issuing Bank (if Agent is not the Issuing Bank) whether or not it intends to borrow hereunder to finance its obligations to reimburse Issuing Bank, and if so, submit a Notice of Borrowing as provided in Section 2(b) hereof. If Borrower fails to so advise Agent and Issuing Bank (if Agent is not the Issuing Bank) and thereafter fails to reimburse Issuing Bank, Agent shall notify each Lender of the demand and the failure of Borrower to reimburse Issuing Bank, and each Lender shall reimburse Issuing Bank for its Commitment Percentage of each such draw paid by Issuing Bank and unreimbursed by Borrower. All such amounts paid by Issuing Bank and/or reimbursed by Lenders shall be treated as an Advance or Advances under the Commitment, which Advances shall be immediately due and payable and shall bear interest at the Maximum Rate. Borrower agrees to pay Agent for the benefit of Lenders commissions for issuing the Letters of Credit (calculated separately for each Letter of Credit) in an amount equal to the greater of (i) $500 or, (ii) one percent (1.00%) of the maximum face amount of the Letter of Credit. Such commissions will be calculated on the basis of a year consisting of 360 days.
(d) . The amount and date of issuance, renewal, extension or reissuance of a Letter of Credit pursuant to the Commitments shall be designated by Borrower's written request delivered to Issuing Bank at least three (3) Business Days prior to the date of such issuance, renewal, extension or reissuance. Concurrently with or promptly following the delivery of the request for a Letter of Credit, Borrower shall execute and deliver to Issuing Bank an application and agreement with respect to the letter of credit, said application and agreement to be in the form used by Issuing Bank (in the event that there is any conflict between the terms of any such application and agreement for any Letter of Credit and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail). Issuing Bank shall not be obligated to issue, renew, extend or reissue any Letter of Credit if (i) the amount thereon when added to the face amount of the outstanding letters of credit plus any reimbursement obligations exceeds ten percent (10%) of the Borrowing Base or (ii) the amount thereof when added to the Total Outstandings would exceed the Commitment."
Procedure for obtaining Letters of Credit

EXHIBIT 99.1
News Release
     Fort Worth, Texas, February 23, 2010  Approach Resources Inc. (NASDAQ: AREX) today reported year-end 2009 proved oil and gas reserves of 218.9 Bcfe. At December 31, 2009, proved reserves consisted of 77% natural gas and 23% oil, condensate and natural gas liquids ("NGLs"), and had a reserve life index of over 20 years based on 2009 production of 8.8 Bcfe. The proved developed portion of year-end 2009 proved reserves was 43%.
     For the year, we replaced 345% of 2009 production from drilling alone. From all sources, we replaced approximately 190% of 2009 production.
     During 2009, the Company reduced capital expenditures and drilling activity due to the extended decline in natural gas prices. As a result, we were able to pay down our long-term debt and increase our liquidity (funds available under our credit facility plus year-end cash and cash equivalents). The following table is a summary of selected, unaudited results from 2009:
Year-End 2009 Proved Reserves
     The following table is a reconciliation of the changes in our proved reserves between December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009:
 
     At December 31, 2009, 93% of the Company's proved reserves were located in our core operating area in the Permian Basin. Year-end 2009 proved reserves in our Cinco Terry field in West Texas totaled 68.7 Bcfe, representing an increase of 50% from year-end 2008 proved reserves of 45.9 Bcfe. Year-end 2009 proved reserves in our Ozona Northeast field in West Texas totaled 134.7 Bcfe. Year-end 2009 proved reserves in our North Bald Prairie field in East Texas totaled 15.5 Bcfe.
     The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows for our proved reserves at December 31, 2009, was $80.0 million. The PV-10, or pre-tax present value of our proved reserves discounted at 10%, was estimated at $128.9 million. The independent engineering firm DeGolyer and MacNaughton prepared our year-end 2009 reserve report and PV-10 estimate for the Current Price Case (defined below). PV-10 is a non-GAAP measure. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures" below for our definition of PV-10 and a reconciliation to the standardized measure (GAAP).
     Under the Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC") new reserve reporting rules, year-end 2009 proved reserves and PV-10 were calculated based on the first-of-the-month, 12-month average price for natural gas, oil and NGLs, or $3.87 per MMBtu, $61.04 per Bbl of oil and $27.20 per Bbl of NGLs, respectively. Our reservoir engineers also calculated our estimated reserves and PV-10 based on the SEC's previous reserve reporting rules, or the year-end 2009 spot price of $5.79 per MMBtu, $76.00 per Bbl of oil and $42.94 per Bbl of NGLs. The following table is a comparison of our year-end 2009 reserves and PV-10 calculated based on the current SEC reserve reporting rules ("Current Price Case") and the SEC's previous reserve reporting rules ("Previous Price Case"):
     Preliminary unaudited estimates of 2009 costs incurred totaled $30.7 million, and included $29.6 million for exploration and development drilling and $1.1 million for property acquisitions. Exploration and development costs included $170,000 in non-cash asset retirement obligations recorded in 2009. Based on 2009 exploration and development expenditures of $29.6 million and proved reserve additions of 30.4 Bcfe, drill-bit finding and development ("F&D") costs were $0.97 per Mcfe. Based on 2009 total costs incurred of $30.7 million and net proved reserve additions of 16.7 Bcfe, all-in F&D costs were $1.84 per Mcfe.
     F&D cost is a non-GAAP measure. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures" below for our definition of F&D costs and a reconciliation to the information required by ASC 932-235.
Production and Operations Update
     Production for the fourth quarter totaled 1,991 MMcfe (21.6 MMcfe/d). Production for fourth quarter of 2009 was 71% natural gas and 29% oil and NGLs.
     During the fourth quarter of 2009, we drilled 13 (6.5 net) wells in Cinco Terry, of which nine (4.5 net) wells were completed as producers, two (one net) wells were plugged and abandoned for mechanical reasons and two (one net) wells were waiting on completion at December 31, 2009. We estimate that
 
drilling in our Cinco Terry field during the fourth quarter of 2009 de-risked approximately 8,000 (4,080 net) acres. We also drilled four (four net) wells in Ozona Northeast, of which two (two net) wells were completed as producers and two (two net) wells were waiting on completion at December 31, 2009.
     Production for 2009 totaled 8,808 MMcfe (24.1 MMcfe/d). Production for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 72% natural gas and 28% oil and NGLs.
     During 2009, we drilled 32 (18 net) wells in the Permian Basin, of which 24 (13 net) wells were completed as producers, two (one net) wells were abandoned for mechanical reasons, two (one net) wells were abandoned as non-productive and four (three net) wells were waiting on completion at December 31, 2009. The four (three net) wells waiting on completion at December 31, 2009, were completed as producers during the first quarter of 2010. We expect to drill 84 (60 net) wells in the Permian Basin during 2010.
     Estimated average daily production for January 2010 was 21.4 MMcfe/d. Estimated average daily production for February 2010 currently is 22.6 MMcfe/d.
     We have completed the acquisition of 3-D seismic data across our Cinco Terry field. Our 3-D seismic data inventory now covers over 135,000 acres in the Permian Basin. We currently are processing the 3-D seismic data from Cinco Terry and expect to see preliminary results in March 2010. Interpretation of the 3-D seismic data is expected to be complete by June 2010.
Expected 2009 Impairments
     In accordance with ASC 360, we review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved and unproved oil and gas properties, accounted for under the successful efforts method of accounting. Based on year-end 2009 proved reserves, we do not expect to record an impairment of proved properties. However, based on the review of the recoverability of the carrying value of our unproved properties, we do expect to report a non-cash impairment charge to unproved oil and gas properties of $2.7 million to $3.0 million in 2009, related to all of our remaining carrying costs in Northeast British Columbia.
Forward-Looking Statements and Cautionary Statements
     This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures
     This release contains certain financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. We have provided reconciliations within this release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP that are presented in this release.
PV-10
     The present value of our proved reserves, discounted at 10% (PV-10), was estimated at $128.9 million at December 31, 2009. Under the Current Price Case, PV-10 was calculated based on the first-of-the-month, 12-month average for natural gas, oil and NGLs, or $3.87 per MMBtu, $61.04 per Bbl of oil and $27.20 per Bbl of NGLs, respectively.
     PV-10 based the Previous Price Case totaled $317.4 million and assumed the posted spot price as of December 31, 2009, for natural gas, oil and NGLs, or $5.79 per MMBtu, $76.00 per Bbl of oil and $42.94 per Bbl of NGLs, respectively.
     PV-10 is our estimate of the present value of future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves after deducting estimated production and ad valorem taxes, future capital costs and operating expenses, but before deducting any estimates of future income taxes. The estimated future net revenues are discounted at an annual rate of 10% to determine their "present value." We believe PV-10 to be an important measure for evaluating the relative significance of our oil and gas properties and that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure of PV-10 provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and investors in evaluating oil and gas companies. Because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid, we believe the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable for evaluating the Company. We believe that PV-10 is a financial measure routinely used and calculated similarly by other companies in the oil and gas industry.
     The following table reconciles PV-10 to our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows (the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP). PV-
 
10 should not be considered as an alternative to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as computed under GAAP.
Finding and Development Costs
     are calculated by dividing the sum of exploration costs and development costs for the year by the total of reserve extensions and discoveries for the year.
Drill-bit finding and development ("F&D") costs
     are calculated by dividing the sum of property acquisition costs, exploration costs and development costs for the year by the total of reserve extensions, discoveries and all revisions for the year.
All-in F&D costs, including revisions,
     are calculated by dividing the sum of property acquisition costs, exploration costs, development costs and the change in future development costs from the prior year by the total of reserve extensions, discoveries and all revisions for the year.
All-in F&D costs, including revisions and the change in future development costs,
     We believe that providing the above measures of F&D cost is useful to assist in an evaluation of how much it costs the Company, on a per Mcfe basis, to add proved reserves. However, these measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our previous SEC filings and to be included in our annual report on Form 10-K to be filed with the SEC on or before March 16, 2010. Due to various factors, including timing differences, F&D costs do not necessarily reflect precisely the costs associated with particular reserves. For example, exploration costs may be recorded in periods before the periods in which related increases in reserves are recorded, and development costs may be recorded in periods after the periods in which related increases in reserves are recorded. In addition, changes in commodity prices can affect the magnitude of recorded increases (or decreases) in reserves independent of the related costs of such increases.
     As a result of the above factors and various factors that could materially affect the timing and amounts of future increases in reserves and the timing and amounts of future costs, including factors disclosed in our filings with the SEC, we cannot assure you that the Company's future F&D costs will not differ materially from those set forth above. Further, the methods used by us to calculate F&D costs may differ significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, our F&D costs may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.
     The following table reflects the reconciliation of our estimated F&D costs for the year ended December 31, 2009 to the information required by paragraphs 11 and 21 of ASC 932-235:
 
 
Production Replacement Calculation
     is calculated by dividing extensions and discoveries of 30.4 Bcfe by production of 8.8 Bcfe. is calculated by dividing net proved reserve additions of 16.7 Bcfe (the sum of extensions and discoveries and revisions) by production of 8.8 Bcfe. We use production replacement ratios as an indicator of the Company's potential ability to replace annual production volumes and grow our reserves. However, these production replacement ratios have limitations. These ratios can vary from year to year for the Company and among other oil and gas companies based on the extent and timing of discoveries and property acquisitions. In addition, since these ratios do not incorporate the cost or timing of future production of new reserves, they should not be used as a measure of value creation.

Exhibit 99.1
News Release
     Fort Worth, Texas, March 9, 2010  Approach Resources Inc. (NASDAQ: AREX) today reported financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2009. Highlights for the year ended December 31, 2009 include:
Year End 2009 Results
     Production for 2009 totaled 8,808 MMcfe (24.1 MMcfe/d), compared to 8,755 MMcfe (23.9 MMcfe/d) produced in 2008. Production for 2009 was 72% natural gas and 28% oil and NGLs, compared 81% natural gas and 19% oil and NGLs in 2008.
     Net loss for 2009 was $5.2 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, on revenues of $40.6 million, compared to net income of $23.4 million, or $1.12 per diluted share, on revenues of $79.9 million, for 2008. Net loss for 2009 included a pre-tax, unrealized loss on commodity derivatives of $9.9 million and an impairment of unproved properties of $3 million related to our exploratory acreage position in Northeast British Columbia.
     Excluding the unrealized loss on commodity derivatives, the impairment of unproved properties and related income taxes, adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for 2009 was $3.3 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $23.5 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, for 2008. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of adjusted net income to net (loss) income.
     EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for 2009 was $36.7 million, or $1.75 per diluted share, compared to $63.2 million, or $3.03 per diluted share, for 2008. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of EBITDAX to net (loss) income.
     Our financial results for 2009 were negatively impacted by a sharp decline in realized commodity prices over the prior year. Average realized natural gas, oil and NGL prices for 2009, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $3.70 per Mcf, $54.97 per Bbl and $28.32 per Bbl, respectively, compared to $8.29 per Mcf, $93.79 per Bbl and $45.46 per Bbl, respectively, for 2008. The Company's average realized price, including the effect of commodity derivatives, was $6.27 per Mcfe for 2009, compared to $9.46 per Mcfe for 2008, a decrease of 33.7%. Of the $39.2 million decrease in revenues, approximately $41.1 million was attributable to a decrease in oil and gas prices, partially offset by $1.9 million in revenues attributable to the slight increase in production volumes over the prior year.
 
     Lease operating expenses ("LOE") for 2009 were $7.8 million, or $0.88 per Mcfe, compared to $7.6 million, or $0.87 per Mcfe, in 2008.
     Severance and production taxes for 2009 were $2 million, or 4.9% of oil and gas sales, compared to $4.2 million, or 5.3% of oil and gas sales, in 2008. The decrease in production taxes was a function of the decrease in oil and gas sales between 2009 and 2008.
     Exploration expense for 2009 and 2008 was $1.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Exploration expense for 2009 resulted primarily from 3-D seismic acquired across Cinco Terry and the expiration of leases in Ozona Northeast and North Bald Prairie. We have re-leased or expect to re-lease substantially all of the expired acreage. Exploration expense for 2008 resulted from one dry hole drilled in Ozona Northeast and $965,000 of lease extensions in Ozona Northeast.
     Impairment of unproved properties for 2009 was $3 million, compared to $6.4 million in 2008. The 2009 impairment resulted from a non-cash write-off of $3 million in acreage costs in Northeast British Columbia, and represents the remaining carrying value we have recorded for the project. The 2008 impairment resulted from the write-off of drilling and completion costs of three wells in Northeast British Columbia and drilling costs of three wells in Southwest Kentucky.
     General and administrative expenses ("G&A") for 2009 were $10.6 million, or $1.21 per Mcfe, compared to $8.9 million, or $1.01 per Mcfe, for 2008. G&A for 2009 included higher share-based compensation, as well as higher salaries and related employee benefit costs attributable to an increase in staff from the prior year period and a severance payment to a former officer. G&A for 2009 also included an increase in franchise taxes.
     Depletion, depreciation and amortization expenses ("DD&A") for 2009 were $24.7 million, or $2.80 per Mcfe, compared to $23.7 million, or $2.71 per Mcfe, for 2008. The increase in DD&A expense was primarily attributable to an increase in oil and gas property costs, partially offset by an increase in our estimated proved oil and gas reserves.
     Capital expenditures during 2009 totaled $29 million.
Fourth Quarter 2009 Results
     Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $2.3 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, on revenues of $11.9 million, compared to net loss of $152,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, on revenues of $14.7 million, for the fourth quarter of 2008. Net loss for fourth quarter of 2009 included the effect of an impairment of non-producing properties of $3 million related to our exploratory acreage position in Northeast British Columbia and a pre-tax, unrealized loss on commodity derivatives of $1.3 million.
     Excluding the impairment, unrealized loss on commodity derivatives and related income taxes, adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $539,000, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $2.6 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2008. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of adjusted net income to net (loss) income.
     EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $9.3 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, compared to $11.6 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2008. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of EBITDAX to net (loss) income.
     LOE for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $1.8 million, or $0.88 per Mcfe, compared to $2.5 million, or $0.95 per Mcfe, in the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in LOE in the fourth quarter of
 
2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 is primarily a result of a concentrated effort on lowering fixed costs.
     Severance and production taxes for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $604,000, or 5.1% of oil and gas sales, compared to $1.3 million, or 8.9% of oil and gas sales, in the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in production taxes was due to the decrease in oil and gas sales between the fourth quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2008, and lower production tax rates applied specifically to Cinco Terry.
     Exploration expense for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $1.1 million. Exploration expense for the fourth quarter of 2009 resulted primarily from 3-D seismic data acquired across Cinco Terry and the expiration of leases in Ozona Northeast and North Bald Prairie. We expect to re-lease substantially all of the expired acreage.
     Impairment of unproved properties for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $3 million, compared to $6.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The impairment expense for the fourth quarter of 2009 resulted from a non-cash write-off of $3 million in acreage costs in Northeast British Columbia, and represents the remaining carrying value we have recorded for the project.
     G&A for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $3.3 million, or $1.68 per Mcfe, compared to $3.2 million, or $1.20 per Mcfe, for the fourth quarter of 2008. Our G&A for the fourth quarter of 2009 included higher share-based compensation, higher salaries and related employee benefit costs attributable to our increase in staff from the fourth quarter of 2008 and a severance payment to a former officer.
     DD&A for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $5.9 million, or $2.96 per Mcfe, compared to $7.5 million, or $2.80 per Mcfe, for the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in DD&A was primarily attributable to an increase in oil and gas property costs, partially offset by an increase in our estimated proved oil and gas reserves.
     Capital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2009 totaled $10 million.
Liquidity and Commodity Derivatives Update
     At December 31, 2009, we had a $200 million revolving credit facility with a $115 million borrowing base, of which $32.3 million and $37.9 million were drawn at December 31, 2009 and February 28, 2010, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, our long-term debt-to-capital ratio and liquidity were 13% and $85.4 million, respectively, compared to 16% and $60.5 million at December 31, 2008. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our definitions of "long-term debt-to-capital ratio" and "liquidity."
     At December 31, 2009, we had the following commodity derivative positions outstanding:
 
2010 Outlook
     We currently are operating two rigs in Cinco Terry and one rig in Ozona Northeast. Average daily production for February 2010 was 22.6 MMcfe/d.
     Our 2010 capital budget for exploration and development expenditures currently is $53 million. We intend to fund 2010 capital expenditures, excluding any acquisitions, primarily out of internally-generated cash flows and, as necessary, borrowings under our credit facility. Approximately $48.5 million, or 92%, of the capital budget is allocated to our core development areas of operation in the Permian Basin, where we plan to drill 48 gross (24 net) wells in Cinco Terry and 36 gross (36 net) wells in Ozona Northeast.
     The table below sets forth our 2010 financial and operational guidance, which remains unchanged from our prior disclosure in November 2009. The 2010 guidance is forward-looking information that is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures
     This release contains certain financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. We have provided reconciliations within this release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures here and on the Non-GAAP Financial Information page in the Investor Relations section of our website at .
www.approachresources.com
Adjusted Net Income
     This release contains the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, which exclude an impairment of long-lived assets, the unrealized, pre-tax loss (gain) on commodity derivatives and related income taxes.
     The amounts included in the calculation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share below were computed in accordance with GAAP. We believe adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are useful to investors because they provide readers with a more meaningful measure of our profitability before recording certain items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably determined. However, these measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
     The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted net income to net (loss) income for the three months and years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively (in thousands, except per-share amounts):
 
EBITDAX
     We define EBITDAX as net (loss) income, plus (1) exploration expense, (2) impairment of unproved properties, (3) depletion, depreciation and amortization expense, (4) share-based compensation expense, (5) impairment of investment, (6) unrealized loss (gain) on commodity derivatives, (7) interest expense and (8) income taxes. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flow as determined by GAAP. The amounts included in the calculation of EBITDAX were computed in accordance with GAAP. EBITDAX is presented herein and reconciled to the GAAP measure of net (loss) income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund development and exploration activities. This measure is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
     The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDAX to net (loss) income for the three months and years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively (in thousands, except per-share amounts):
 
Long-Term Debt-to-Capital Ratio
     Long-term debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as of December 31, 2009, and by dividing long-term debt (GAAP) of $32.3 million by the sum of total stockholders' equity (GAAP) and long-term debt (GAAP) of $252.8 million. We use the long-term debt-to-capital ratio as a measurement of our overall financial leverage. However, this ratio has limitations. This ratio can vary from year to year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the ratio on a company's financial statements. This ratio is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
Liquidity
     Liquidity is calculated by adding the net funds available under our revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents. We use liquidity as an indicator of the Company's ability to fund development and exploration activities. However, this measurement has limitations. This measurement can vary from year to year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the measurement on a company's financial statements. This measurement is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.

Exhibit 99.1
News Release
     Fort Worth, Texas, May 4, 2010  Approach Resources Inc. (NASDAQ: AREX) today reported financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2010. Highlights for the first quarter of 2010, compared to the first quarter of 2009, include:
     In addition, average daily production for April 2010 increased 13% to 24.8 MMcfe/d, compared to production for the first quarter of 2010.
Management's Comments
     J. Ross Craft, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Our low-cost operations and long-lived reserves, combined with our ability to shift our operational focus from gas to oil and NGLs, are unique strengths of Approach. While commodity prices improved over the prior year quarter, the near-term outlook for natural gas prices still remains uncertain. We have the flexibility to respond to fluctuating natural gas prices by reducing rig counts under short-term operating contracts and reallocating capital to Cinco Terry where we produce more oil and NGLs. We also believe our investment in a 3-D seismic acquisition program in Cinco Terry during the first quarter of 2010 will allow our team of geoscientists to high-grade our drilling locations in order to find and develop low-cost reserves. Above all, our team is committed to capital discipline in order to deliver long-term value to our stockholders."
First Quarter of 2010 Results
     Net income for the first quarter of 2010 was $3.6 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, on revenues of $13.2 million, compared to net income of $868,000, or $0.04 per diluted share, on revenues of $10.1 million, for the first quarter of 2009. Net income for the first quarter of 2010 included the effect of a pre-tax, unrealized gain on commodity derivatives of $5.1 million.
     Excluding the unrealized gain on commodity derivatives and related income taxes, adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for the first quarter of 2010 was $200,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net loss of $548,000, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2009. See "Supplemental
 
Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of adjusted net income (loss) to net income.
     Production for the first quarter of 2010 totaled 2 Bcfe (22 MMcfe/d), compared to 2.5 Bcfe (28.1 MMcfe/d) produced in the first quarter of 2009, a decrease of 22%. First quarter 2010 production was 72% natural gas and 28% oil and NGLs, compared to 70% natural gas and 30% oil and NGLs in the first quarter of 2009.
     EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for the first quarter of 2010 was $9 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, compared to $8.3 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2009. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of EBITDAX to net income.
     Average realized natural gas, oil and NGL prices for the first quarter of 2010, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $5.39 per Mcf, $75.42 per Bbl of oil and $43.33 per Bbl of NGLs, respectively, compared to $3.73 per Mcf, $34.37 per Bbl of oil and $20.99 per Bbl of NGLs, respectively, for the first quarter of 2009. Our average realized price, including the effect of commodity derivatives, was $6.79 per Mcfe for the first quarter of 2010, compared to $5.24 per Mcfe for the first quarter of 2009, an increase of 30%. Of the $3.2 million increase in revenues, approximately $6.9 million was attributable to an increase in oil and gas prices, partially offset by approximately $3.7 million attributable to a reduction in production volumes.
     Lease operating expenses ("LOE") for the first quarter of 2010 were $1.8 million, or $0.93 per Mcfe, compared to $2.4 million, or $0.94 per Mcfe, in the first quarter of 2009.
     Severance and production taxes for the first quarter of 2010 were $694,000, or 5.2% of oil and gas sales, compared to $430,000, or 4.3% of oil and gas sales, in the first quarter of 2009. The increase in production taxes was primarily due to the increase in oil and gas sales over the prior year period.
     Exploration expense for the first quarter of 2010 was $1.5 million, or $0.75 per Mcfe. Exploration expense for the first quarter of 2010 resulted primarily from our acquisition of 3-D seismic data across Cinco Terry. We recorded no exploration expense for the first quarter of 2009. We expect quarterly exploration expense for the remainder of 2010 to decrease from the first quarter of 2010, and exploration expense for the full year 2010 to total between $0.30 per Mcfe and $0.40 per Mcfe.
     General and administrative expenses ("G&A") for the first quarter of 2010 were $2.5 million, or $1.27 per Mcfe, compared to $2.8 million, or $1.11 per Mcfe, for the first quarter of 2009. Our G&A for the first quarter of 2010 included lower share-based compensation, professional fees and data processing, compared to the first quarter of 2009.
     Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense ("DD&A") for the first quarter of 2010 was $5.8 million, or $2.94 per Mcfe, compared to $6.9 million, or $2.74 per Mcfe, for the first quarter of 2009. The increase in DD&A per Mcfe was primarily attributable to an increase in capitalized costs and a decrease in estimated proved developed reserves, partially offset by a decrease in production over the prior year period.
Operations Update
     Capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2010 totaled $13.9 million, including the completion of four gross (three net) wells that were waiting on completion at December 31, 2009. During the first quarter of 2010, we drilled a total of 20 gross (14 net) wells, of which 18 gross (13 net) wells were completed as producers and two gross (one net) wells were waiting on completion at March 31, 2010. The two gross (one net) wells waiting on completion at March 31, 2010, have since been completed as producers.
 
     We currently are operating three rigs in Cinco Terry and one rig in Ozona Northeast. Average daily production for April 2010 was 24.8 MMcfe/d.
     In the first quarter of 2010, we completed the acquisition of 3-D seismic data across Cinco Terry. Although interpretation and integrated mapping of the data is not expected to be complete until September 2010, we have drilled two gross (one net) wells that targeted the Ellenburger reservoir in addition to the Canyon formation since receiving initial 3-D seismic data. The first well, University 42-22 #7, had 25 feet of net pay in the Ellenburger and 80 feet of net pay in the Canyon. This well has been completed in the Ellenburger at an initial production rate of 1.1 MMcf/d and 51 Bbls/d of oil on a 10/64" choke with 2,430 pounds per square inch wellhead flowing pressure. We plan to complete the Canyon pay interval at a later date. The second well, University 42-22 #9, had 18 feet of net pay in the Ellenburger and 41 feet of net pay in the Canyon. This well currently is waiting on completion.
     We have received conditional permits from the Board of County Commissioners of Rio Arriba County, New Mexico for eight drilling locations in our Mancos Shale/Niobrara El Vado East project. We are evaluating the conditions and potential costs for the approved locations and will develop a plan for these locations during the second and third quarters of 2010.
Liquidity and Commodity Derivatives Update
     We have a $200 million revolving credit agreement with a $115 million borrowing base, of which $37.2 million was drawn at March 31, 2010. In May 2010, we amended our revolving credit agreement to (i) extend the maturity date by one year to July 31, 2012, (ii) increase our commodity derivatives limit from 75% to 85% of projected production from proved developed producing properties and (iii) transfer the interest of Fortis Capital Corp. to BNP Paribas. In addition, the lenders under our revolving credit facility reaffirmed our borrowing base at $115 million. Our borrowing base is redetermined semiannually. At March 31, 2010, our long-term debt-to-capital ratio and liquidity were 14% and $78.4 million, respectively. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our definitions of "long-term debt-to-capital ratio" and "liquidity."
     At March 31, 2010, we had commodity derivatives covering 54% of our expected natural gas production for the remainder of 2010, based on the midpoint of 2010 production guidance, at a weighted average price of $6.18 per MMBtu. The following table details our commodity derivative positions at March 31, 2010:

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures
     This release contains certain financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. We have provided reconciliations within this release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures here and on the Non-GAAP Financial Information page in the Investor Relations section of our website at .
www.approachresources.com
Adjusted Net Income
     This release contains the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share, which exclude an unrealized, pre-tax gain on commodity derivatives and related income taxes.
     The amounts included in the calculation of adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share below were computed in accordance with GAAP. We believe adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are useful to investors because they provide readers with a more meaningful measure of our profitability before recording certain items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably determined. However, these measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
 
     The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted net income (loss) to net income for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively (in thousands, except per-share amounts):
EBITDAX
     We define EBITDAX as net income, plus (1) exploration expense, (2) depletion, depreciation and amortization expense, (3) share-based compensation expense, (4) unrealized gain on commodity derivatives, (5) interest expense and (6) income taxes. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flow as determined by GAAP. The amounts included in the calculation of EBITDAX were computed in accordance with GAAP. EBITDAX is presented herein and reconciled to the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund development and exploration activities. This measure is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
     The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDAX to net income for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively (in thousands, except per-share amounts):
Long-Term Debt-to-Capital Ratio
     Long-term debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as of March 31, 2010, and by dividing long-term debt (GAAP) of $37.2 million by the sum of total stockholders' equity (GAAP) and long-term debt (GAAP) of $261.8 million. We use the long-term debt-to-capital ratio as a measurement of our overall financial leverage. However, this ratio has limitations. This ratio can vary from year to year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the ratio on a company's financial statements. This ratio is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
 
Liquidity
     Liquidity is calculated by adding the net funds available under our revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents. We use liquidity as an indicator of the Company's ability to fund development and exploration activities. However, this measurement has limitations. This measurement can vary from year to year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the measurement on a company's financial statements. This measurement is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.

     Effective May 3, 2010, Approach Resources Inc. (the "Company") entered into an eighth amendment (the "Eighth Amendment") to its Credit Agreement dated as of January 18, 2008 (as amended, the "Credit Agreement") by and among the Company and its subsidiary guarantors, the lenders and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent and lender.
     The Eight Amendment (i) extends the maturity date of the Credit Agreement by one year to July 31, 2012, (ii) increases the Company's commodity derivatives limit from 75% to 85% of annual projected production from proved developed producing oil and gas properties, (iii) reaffirms the borrowing base and lenders' aggregate commitment of $115 million and (iv) transfers Fortis Capital Corp.'s interest in the Credit Agreement to BNP Paribas.
     The Company paid an extension fee of $287,500 in conjunction with the Eighth Amendment, calculated as 0.25% of the lenders' aggregate commitment of $115 million.
     The borrowing base is redetermined semiannually on or before each April 1 and October 1 based on the Company's oil and gas reserves. The Company or the lenders can each request one additional borrowing base redetermination each calendar year. The lenders may exercise discretion and have the ability to reduce our borrowing base on the basis of subjective factors, including the loan collateral value that each lender, in its discretion and using the methodology, assumptions and discount rates as such lender customarily uses in evaluating oil and gas properties, assigns to our properties.
     The foregoing description of the terms of the Eighth Amendment is qualified in its entirety by the Eighth Amendment, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this current report and is incorporated herein by reference.
     The information set forth under Item 1.01 above is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
News Release
     Fort Worth, Texas, August 3, 2010  Approach Resources Inc. (NASDAQ: AREX) today reported financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2010. Highlights for the second quarter of 2010, compared to the second quarter of 2009, include:
     In addition, average daily production for July 2010 increased 8% to 26.5 MMcfe/d, compared to production for the second quarter of 2010.
     Separately, the Company today reported mid-year 2010 proved reserves of 278.3 Bcfe, an increase of 27% from year end 2009. Total proved reserves at June 30, 2010, were 50% oil and NGLs and 50% natural gas, compared to 23% oil and NGLs and 77% natural gas at year end 2009.
Management's Comments
     J. Ross Craft, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We delivered strong results during the second quarter and first half of 2010. Our results were led by increases in proved reserves, production and adjusted net income. With our planned processing upgrades in Ozona Northeast, a more favorable commodity price environment and continued drilling success in Cinco Terry, we have increased our proved oil and NGL reserves 173% to 23 MMBbls. Our reserve base is now 50% oil and NGLs, 50% natural gas and 48% proved developed. Also, we continued to grow production from the prior quarter, the third consecutive quarter for production growth since we resumed drilling in the second half of 2009. Further, our increase in proved developed reserves resulted in lower DD&A and, along with higher commodity prices, helped drive a 29% increase in adjusted net income to $0.13 per share, our best result since 2008. We believe our solid reserve base, successful drilling program and dedicated team have positioned us to continue to deliver positive performance for stockholders in the second half of 2010 and beyond."
Second Quarter of 2010 Results
     Net income for the second quarter of 2010 was $1.6 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, on revenues of $13.2 million, compared to a net loss of $671,000, or $0.03 per diluted share, on revenues of $9.9 million, for the second quarter of 2009. Net income for the second quarter of 2010 included a pretax, unrealized loss on commodity derivatives of $1.9 million.
 
     Excluding the unrealized loss on commodity derivatives and related income taxes, adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for the second quarter of 2010 was $2.8 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $2.2 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2009. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income (loss).
     Production for the second quarter of 2010 totaled 2.2 Bcfe (24.5 MMcfe/d), compared to 2.3 Bcfe (25.1 MMcfe/d) produced in the second quarter of 2009, a decrease of 2.2%. Second quarter 2010 production was 70% natural gas and 30% oil and NGLs, compared to 71% natural gas and 29% oil and NGLs in the second quarter of 2009.
     EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for the second quarter of 2010 was $10.3 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, compared to $10.2 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2009. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of EBITDAX to net income (loss).
     Average realized natural gas, oil and NGL prices for the second quarter of 2010, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $4.41 per Mcf, $73.26 per Bbl of oil and $40.33 per Bbl of NGLs, respectively, compared to $3.28 per Mcf, $55.60 per Bbl of oil and $26.84 per Bbl of NGLs, respectively, for the second quarter of 2009. Our average realized price, including the effect of commodity derivatives, was $6.69 per Mcfe for the second quarter of 2010, compared to $6.30 per Mcfe for the second quarter of 2009, an increase of 6.2%. Of the $3.2 million increase in revenues, approximately $3.5 million was attributable to an increase in oil and gas prices, partially offset by approximately $300,000 attributable to a slight decrease in production.
     Lease operating expenses ("LOE") for the second quarter of 2010 were $2.2 million, or $0.99 per Mcfe, compared to $1.8 million, or $0.77 per Mcfe, in the second quarter of 2009. The increase in LOE per Mcfe over the prior year quarter was due primarily to higher ad valorem taxes and well repairs and maintenance. The higher ad valorem taxes for the second quarter of 2010 included a change in our estimated ad valorem taxes for 2010 attributable to higher commodity price assumptions used by taxing authorities to calculate final taxes for 2010.
     Severance and production taxes for the second quarter of 2010 were $610,000, or 4.6% of oil and gas sales, compared to $507,000, or 5.1% of oil and gas sales, in the second quarter of 2009. The increase in production taxes was primarily due to the increase in oil and gas sales over the prior year period.
     Exploration expense for the second quarter of 2010 was $187,000, or $0.08 per Mcfe. Exploration expense for the second quarter of 2010 resulted primarily from lease extensions in Cinco Terry. We recorded no exploration expense for the second quarter of 2009.
     General and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2010 were $2.2 million, or $0.98 per Mcfe, compared to $2.2 million, or $0.98 per Mcfe, for the second quarter of 2009.
     Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense ("DD&A") for the second quarter of 2010 was $5 million, or $2.25 per Mcfe, compared to $6.2 million, or $2.73 per Mcfe, for the second quarter of 2009. The decrease in DD&A was primarily attributable to an increase in estimated proved developed reserves at June 30, 2010, and a slight decrease in production over the prior year period. Our estimated proved developed reserves at June 30, 2010, increased primarily due to the expected NGL recoveries in Ozona Northeast after the first quarter of 2011, higher commodity prices, and well performance, planned processing upgrades and development drilling in Cinco Terry during the first half of 2010.
 
Operations Update
     Capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2010 totaled $15.9 million. During the second quarter of 2010, we drilled a total of 25 gross (14.5 net) wells, of which 21 gross (12.5 net) wells were completed as producers and four gross (two net) wells were waiting on completion at June 30, 2010. The four gross (two net) wells waiting on completion at June 30, 2010, have since been completed as producers.
     We currently are operating three rigs in Cinco Terry. Average daily production for July 2010 was 26.5 MMcfe/d, an 8% increase over second quarter production of 24.5 MMcfe/d.
     As previously disclosed, earlier this year we received conditional permits from Rio Arriba County, New Mexico for eight drilling locations. Under the County's oil and gas ordinance, additional approvals are required after satisfaction of the permit conditions and before drilling. A County decision on a ninth permit application has been delayed. In addition, we have received notice from the State of New Mexico that public hearings on requested proration units will be required for at least two potential drilling locations in the County. As a result of ongoing regulatory and permitting delays in New Mexico, we expect to focus on our core development drilling in West Texas for the remainder of 2010, and do not expect to begin drilling in New Mexico before the second half of 2011.
Liquidity and Commodity Derivatives Update
     We have a $200 million revolving credit agreement with a $115 million borrowing base, of which $42.2 million was drawn at June 30, 2010. At June 30, 2010, our debt-to-capital ratio and liquidity were 16% and $72.8 million, respectively. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our definitions of "debt-to-capital ratio" and "liquidity."
     At June 30, 2010, we had commodity derivatives covering 50% of our expected natural gas production for the remainder of 2010, based on the midpoint of 2010 production guidance, at a weighted average price of $6.18 per MMBtu. The following table details our commodity derivative positions at June 30, 2010:

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures
     This release contains certain financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. We have provided reconciliations within this release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures here and on the Non-GAAP Financial Information page in the Investor Relations section of our website at .
www.approachresources.com
Adjusted Net Income
     This release contains the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, which exclude an unrealized, pretax loss (gain) on commodity derivatives and related income taxes.
     The amounts included in the calculation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share below were computed in accordance with GAAP. We believe adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are useful to investors because they provide readers with a more meaningful measure of our profitability before recording certain items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably determined. However, these measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
 
     The following table reconciles adjusted net income to net income (loss) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively (in thousands, except per-share amounts):
EBITDAX
     We define EBITDAX as net income, plus (1) exploration expense, (2) depletion, depreciation and amortization expense, (3) share-based compensation expense, (4) unrealized loss (gain) on commodity derivatives, (5) interest expense and (6) income taxes. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flow as determined by GAAP. The amounts included in the calculation of EBITDAX were computed in accordance with GAAP. EBITDAX is presented herein and reconciled to the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund development and exploration activities. This measure is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
     The following table reconciles EBITDAX to net income (loss) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively (in thousands, except per-share amounts):
 
Debt-to-Capital Ratio
     Debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as of June 30, 2010, by dividing long-term debt (GAAP) of $42.2 million by the sum of total stockholders' equity (GAAP) and long-term debt (GAAP) of $268.7 million. We use the debt-to-capital ratio as a measurement of our overall financial leverage. However, this ratio has limitations. This ratio can vary from year to year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the ratio on a company's financial statements. This ratio is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
Liquidity
     Liquidity is calculated by adding the net funds available under our revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents. We use liquidity as an indicator of the Company's ability to fund development and exploration activities. However, this measurement has limitations. This measurement can vary from year to year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the measurement on a company's financial statements. This measurement is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.

Exhibit 99.2
News Release
     Fort Worth, Texas, August 3, 2010  Approach Resources Inc. (NASDAQ: AREX) today reported mid-year 2010 proved oil and gas reserves of 278.3 Bcfe. Proved reserves grew by 27% from 218.9 Bcfe at year end 2009. Proved oil and NGL reserves grew 173% to 23.1 MMBbls, up from 8.4 MMBbls at year end 2009. Total proved reserves at June 30, 2010, were 50% oil and NGLs and 50% natural gas, compared to 23% oil and NGLs and 77% natural gas at year end 2009. Proved developed reserves grew by 44% to 134.5 Bcfe and now represent 48% of the reserve base, compared to 43% at year end 2009.
     The Company's increase in proved reserves at June 30, 2010, is primarily due to planned processing upgrades in our largest field in the Permian Basin, Ozona Northeast, after the first quarter of 2011. At that time, our current, wellhead gas purchase contract will have expired and we will begin realizing NGL revenues from the
 
liquids-rich gas stream in Ozona Northeast. Improved pricing for natural gas, oil and NGLs, and planned processing upgrades, well performance and development drilling in Cinco Terry also contributed to the increase in proved reserves at June 30, 2010.
Management's Comment
     J. Ross Craft, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We will begin to realize the processing upgrades from the liquids-rich gas stream in Ozona Northeast with the expiration of our current, wellhead gas purchase agreement in Ozona Northeast after the first quarter of 2011. These future upgrades added approximately 14 MMBbls of NGLs to our proved reserve base at mid-year 2010. Further, we expect the sale of higher-value NGLs to enhance the economics of our development program in Ozona Northeast and support future growth in the area. Also, during the first half of 2010, we executed a successful drilling program, particularly in Cinco Terry where we were able to increase reserves by over 11%. Combined, the future sale of NGLs in Ozona Northeast, improved price environment and our successful drilling program in Cinco Terry drove our increase in proved reserves and PV-10, and rebalanced our reserves between liquids and natural gas without additional capital expenditures. We believe that now, more than ever, our proved reserves and deep inventory of repeatable, multi-pay drilling locations put us in an exceptional position to increase long-term value for our stockholders."
Mid-Year 2010 Proved Reserves and PV-10
     The following table is a summary of our estimated proved reserves at June 30, 2010, compared to proved reserves at year end 2009. We determined the natural gas equivalent of oil and NGLs by using a conversion ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of oil or NGLs.
     At June 30, 2010, 95% of the Company's proved reserves were located in our core operating area in the Permian Basin. Mid-year 2010 proved reserves in Ozona Northeast increased 39% to 186.9 Bcfe from year-end 2009 proved reserves of 134.8 Bcfe. Mid-year 2010 proved reserves in Cinco Terry increased 11% to 76.3 Bcfe from year-end 2009 proved reserves of 68.7 Bcfe.
     The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows for our proved reserves at June 30, 2010, was $180.3 million. The PV-10, or pre-tax present value of our proved reserves discounted at 10%, increased $148.9 million, or 115%, to $277.8 million, compared to $128.9 million at year end 2009. PV-10 is a non-GAAP measure. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures" below for our definition of PV-10 and a reconciliation to the standardized measure (GAAP).
     Estimates of proved reserves at June 30, 2010, were prepared by the independent engineering firm DeGolyer and MacNaughton. Estimates of the PV-10 of our proved reserves were prepared by the Company's reservoir engineers. Estimates of proved reserves and PV-10 were calculated using $4.09 per MMBtu of natural gas, $75.99 per Bbl of oil and $36.12 per Bbl of NGLs.
Ozona Northeast
     In Ozona Northeast, we primarily target the Canyon Sands formation. We have an approximate 100% working interest and 80% net revenue interest across the field. On average, our current gross estimated ultimate recovery ("EUR") per typical Canyon well is 500 MMcfe, or 400 MMcfe net comprised of 95% natural gas and
,
 
5% oil. After the first quarter of 2011, we will begin to realize the benefits of processing the wet gas stream in Ozona Northeast, which has a heating value of 1,250 Btu/cf when processed. We expect the net EUR per typical Canyon well to increase 25% to approximately 500 MMcfe, comprised of 44% NGLs, 6% oil and 50% natural gas, which reflects the process of shrinking the natural gas production and recovering the NGLs.
Finding and Development Costs
     Preliminary, unaudited estimates of costs incurred during the first six months of 2010 totaled $29.3 million, and included $28 million for exploration and development drilling and $1.3 million for property acquisitions. Based on total costs incurred during the first six months of 2010 of $29.3 million and total proved reserve additions of 63.5 Bcfe, all-in finding and development ("F&D") costs were $0.46 per Mcfe. F&D cost is a non-GAAP measure. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures" below for our definition of F&D costs and a reconciliation to the information required by ASC 932-235.
Forward-Looking Statements and Cautionary Statements
     This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this press release that address activities, events or developments that the Company expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the use of terms such as "may," "will," "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate" and similar words, although some forward-looking statements may be expressed differently. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, forward-looking statements contained in this press release specifically include the expiration of the Company's gas purchasing contract for Ozona Northeast, the benefits of processing upgrades, estimated proved reserves and expected ultimate recoveries. These statements are based on certain assumptions made by the Company based on management's experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, anticipated future developments and other factors believed to be appropriate. Such statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the Company,
 
which may cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. Further information on such assumptions, risks and uncertainties is available in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Our SEC filings are available on our website at . Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the Company undertakes no obligation to correct or update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.
www.approachresources.com
     The SEC permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved, probable and possible reserves that meet the SEC's definitions for such terms, and price and cost sensitivities for such reserves, and prohibits disclosure of resources that do not constitute such reserves. The Company uses the terms "estimated ultimate recovery," "EUR," reserve "potential," "upside" or other descriptions of volumes of reserves potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that the SEC's rules may prohibit the Company from including in filings with the SEC. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of being actually realized by the Company.
     Information in this release regarding the standardized measure and costs incurred for oil and gas properties is unaudited. Final and audited results will be provided in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, to be filed on or before March 16, 2011.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures
     This release contains certain financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. We have provided reconciliations within this release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP that are presented in this release.
PV-10
     The present value of our proved reserves, discounted at 10% ("PV-10"), was estimated at $277.8 million at June 30, 2010, and was calculated based on the first-of-the-month, twelve-month average prices for natural gas, oil and NGLs, or $4.09 per MMBtu of natural gas, $75.99 per Bbl of oil and $36.12 per Bbl of NGLs, respectively.
     PV-10 is our estimate of the present value of future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves after deducting estimated production and ad valorem taxes, future capital costs and operating expenses, but before deducting any estimates of future income taxes. The estimated future net revenues are discounted at an annual rate of 10% to determine their "present value." We believe PV-10 to be an important measure for evaluating the relative significance of our oil and gas properties and that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure of PV-10 provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and investors in evaluating oil and gas companies. Because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid, we believe the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable
 
for evaluating the Company. We believe that PV-10 is a financial measure routinely used and calculated similarly by other companies in the oil and gas industry.
     The following table reconciles PV-10 to our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. PV-10 should not be considered as an alternative to the standardized measure as computed under GAAP.
Finding and Development Costs
     are calculated by dividing the sum of property acquisition costs, exploration costs and development costs for the period by the total of reserve extensions, discoveries and all revisions for the period.
All-in finding and development ("F&D") costs
     We believe that providing the above measures of F&D cost is useful to assist in an evaluation of how much it costs the Company, on a per Mcfe basis, to add proved reserves. However, these measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our previous SEC filings and to be included in our annual report on Form 10-K to be filed with the SEC on or before March 16, 2011. Due to various factors, including timing differences, F&D costs do not necessarily reflect precisely the costs associated with particular reserves. For example, exploration costs may be recorded in periods before the periods in which related increases in reserves are recorded, and development costs may be recorded in periods after the periods in which related increases in reserves are recorded. In addition, changes in commodity prices can affect the magnitude of recorded increases (or decreases) in reserves independent of the related costs of such increases. Further, all-in F&D costs at June 30, 2010, are materially lower than the Company's historical, all-in F&D costs due to the increase in proved reserves resulting from future processing of NGLs in Ozona Northeast at no additional capital cost.
     As a result of the above factors and various factors that could materially affect the timing and amounts of future increases in reserves and the timing and amounts of future costs, including factors disclosed in our filings with the SEC, we cannot assure you that the Company's future F&D costs will not differ materially from those set forth above. Further, the methods used by us to calculate F&D costs may differ significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, our F&D costs may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.
 
     The following table reconciles our estimated F&D costs for the six months ended June 30, 2010, to the information required by paragraphs 11 and 21 of ASC 932-235:

otherwise than under Sections 7(a) or 7(b) hereof. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary or (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be paid or reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representative and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this Section 7(c), the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
     (d) . If the indemnification provided for in Sections 7(a) or 7(b) hereof is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such section, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the
Contribution
 
other, from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Shares and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Shares. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriter, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     (e) . The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 7(d) hereof. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 7(d) hereof shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Shares exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability

     (f) . The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.

10. .
Defaulting Underwriter
     (a) If, on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Shares that it has agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Shares by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Shares, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Shares on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Shares that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in Section 10(a) hereof, the aggregate number of Shares that remain unpurchased on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate number of Shares to be purchased on such date, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Shares that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder on such date plus such Underwriter's pro rata share (based on the number of Shares that such Underwriter agreed to purchase on such date) of the Shares of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
 
     (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in Section 10(a) hereof, the aggregate number of Shares that remain unpurchased on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate amount of Shares to be purchased on such date, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in Section 10(b) hereof, then this Agreement or, with respect to any Additional Closing Date, the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase Shares on the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
     (d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.

(d)
Exhibits.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: January 14, 2011
 

Exhibit 10.1
PRR 0029-000
 
PRR 0029-000
     This Contract is entered as of January 1, 2011, among , (collectively "Seller") and ("Buyer").
APPROACH RESOURCES I, LP
APPROACH OIL & GAS INC.
DCP MIDSTREAM, LP
     In consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, the parties agree as follows:
     (a) . Seller commits to this Contract and will sell and deliver and Buyer will purchase and receive the gas produced from all wells now or later located on all oil and gas interests now or later owned or controlled by Seller on or allocated to the following lands in Crockett and Schleicher Counties, Texas:
1. 
COMMITMENT
.
Committed Lands and Leases
The Block 54 acreage shaded in blue, the Cinco Terry acreage shaded in pink, the Northeast Ozona acreage shaded in purple, the new acreage shaded in yellow to the extent not covered by the Preferential Right (defined below) held by WTG (defined below), and the additional acreage shaded in gray, all as shown on the Exhibit B-1 Map.
Buyer also commits to receive, gather, and process Seller's gas delivered hereunder for extraction of NGLs in accordance with this Contract. Definitions and General Terms and Conditions included in this Contract are attached as Exhibit A. All Exhibits referenced herein are attached and incorporated by reference. In the event of any conflict between this Contract and the Exhibits, this Contract shall govern.
     (b) . The Cinco Terry acreage shown on the Exhibit B-1 Map and shaded in pink is subject to an existing prior commitment to WTG Benedum Joint Venture ("WTG") that expires as of November 30, 2012. Deliveries from the Cinco Terry acreage under this Contract will not commence prior to that date unless Seller's prior commitment to WTG does not apply. WTG also holds an option to extend the prior commitment under its existing gas Purchase Agreement dated as of November 21, 2007, as amended June 3, 2009, among Approach Oil & Gas Inc., Approach Operating, LLC, and WTG ("Preferential Right"). Buyer has an existing pipeline that extends northwest from Buyer's present gathering system to the contemplated new Delivery Point for the Cinco Terry acreage, indicated in red in the Exhibit B-1 map ("FinTex Line"). The FinTex Line is presently idle, and Buyer must review its integrity by hydrotesting and must secure its rights of way and other realty rights relating to the FinTex Line prior to resuming its operation. Buyer will conduct its hydrotest and review of realty rights for the FinTex Line substantially in advance of November 30, 2012, and in any event no later than March 31, 2011. If the hydrotest or review of realty rights indicates that resumption of operations using the FinTex Line is not economically feasible, Buyer will construct or otherwise secure a replacement line and Delivery Point, which may not be in the same location, but which will be in a
Cinco Terry Acreage
 
location reasonably acceptable to Seller, to support deliveries of gas from the Cinco Terry acreage under this Contract. Seller will give timely notice to WTG that Seller is terminating its contract with WTG as of November 30, 2012. If WTG validly exercises its Preferential Right to extend its contract with Seller, Seller's commitment of the Cinco Terry acreage under this Contract will terminate. If WTG does not validly exercise its Preferential Right, Seller's commitment of the Cinco Terry acreage under this Contract will apply and be effective as of December 1, 2012.
     (c) . The Northeast Ozona acreage shown on the Exhibit B-1 Map and shaded in purple is subject to a prior commitment to Ozona Pipeline Energy Company ("Ozona"), and Ozona then has contracted with Buyer for processing of the Northeast Ozona acreage gas production. Seller and Buyer each agree to terminate their respective commitments with Ozona as they relate to the Northeast Ozona acreage effective no later than the close of business on March 31, 2011. Buyer's and Seller's commitment relating to the Northeast Ozona acreage shown on Exhibit B-1 shall not become effective until April 1, 2011, or sooner if Seller is able to obtain an earlier termination of its commitment to Ozona.
Northeast Ozona Acreage
     The Delivery Points for gas to be delivered by Seller to Buyer will be at the inlets of Buyer's Facilities at the three locations shown on Exhibit B-1 and described in Exhibit B-2. Seller is responsible for connecting all production from the committed area and gathering it to these three Delivery Points. Buyer will install, own, and operate the connecting pipeline from its existing system to the three Delivery Points and the Delivery Points meter stations. Seller shall retain title to the NGLs content of the gas delivered by Seller until they are extracted at the plant and available for sale. Seller will then sell its NGLs to Buyer at the plant tailgate as more fully stated in Section 5, Price. Title to the remainder of the gas and all its components shall pass to and vest in Buyer at the Delivery Points without regard to the purposes for which Buyer may later use or sell the gas or its components.
2. 
DELIVERY POINTS
.
     Subject to the reservations of Seller in Section C of Exhibit A, Seller will deliver the gas at the Delivery Points at a pressure sufficient to enable it to enter Buyer's Facilities against the working pressure at reasonably uniform rates of delivery, not to exceed the maximum allowable operating pressure of 1200 psia established by Buyer or pressures that prevent others from producing ratably. Buyer in its discretion may require that Seller install and operate a pressure relief or reduction device upstream of any Delivery Point set at the pressure designated by Buyer to limit the pressure at which Seller delivers gas, where Seller's deliveries might interfere with ratable deliveries from others, or to enhance safety.
3. 
DELIVERY PRESSURE
.
 
     (a) Seller shall deliver and Buyer shall purchase and take Seller's gas subject to the operating conditions and capacity of Buyer's Facilities. Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts to market gas for resale and operate its facilities in an effort to maintain consistent takes of all available quantities. If Buyer is unable to take the full quantities available, Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts to purchase gas from the lands covered by this Contract ratably with its purchases of similar gas in each common gathering system or area within its capabilities using existing facilities, in compliance with Buyer's existing contracts and with applicable laws and regulations, including ratable purchases from Buyer's Affiliates. Within the capabilities of Buyer's Facilities, Seller will deliver and Buyer will take gas from all committed areas in reasonably consistent daily quantities. All gas and NGLs purchased from Seller shall be purchased and allocated using the applicable provisions of Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.4 and 5.6 of this Contract.
4. 
QUANTITY
.
     (b) Seller may dispose of any gas not taken by Buyer for any reason, including events of force majeure, subject to Buyer's right to resume purchases at any subsequent time. If Buyer does not take gas for 15 consecutive Days and Seller secures a different temporary market, Buyer may resume purchases only upon 15 Days' advance written notice as of the beginning of a month unless otherwise agreed.
     (c) Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver gas meeting the quality requirements of Exhibit A, Section F.1 and to avoid delivery of Inferior Liquids. If the gas at any Delivery Point becomes insufficient in volume (under Section 5.5), quality (under Exhibit A, Section F.1), or pressure (under Section 3), Buyer may cease gas takes from the Delivery Point upon 15 Days' advance written notice to Seller as long as the condition exists. If Buyer ceases taking gas under this Section for 30 consecutive Days for reasons other than quality or Force Majeure, Seller may terminate this Contract with respect to the affected Delivery Points upon 30 Days' advance written notice to Buyer; provided that during the notice period Buyer may resume full takes and purchases, and thereby avoid Contract termination under Seller's notice. If Buyer disconnects the Delivery Point or removes the measurement device, meter tube and/or other equipment (which Buyer shall only do on 15 Days' advance written notice to Seller) and Seller later delivers a written request to Buyer to reconnect the Delivery Point, then within 30 Days after receipt of Seller's notice, Buyer shall either reconnect the Delivery Point or terminate this Contract as to any affected Delivery Points by 15 Days' advance written notice to Seller. If Buyer elects to reconnect the Delivery Point, before Buyer makes the reconnection, Seller shall pay to Buyer the fee that Buyer then charges for similar reconnections.
 
     
5. 
PRICE
.
     As full consideration for Seller's gas and all its components delivered to Buyer each month, Buyer shall pay Seller (a) the applicable percentage under Table 5.1 below of the net Residue Gas value under Section 5.2 for Residue Gas allocated to Seller's gas, and (b) the applicable percentage under Table 5.1 of the net value under Section 5.4 for any recovered NGLs allocated to Seller's gas. No separate payment or value calculation is to be made under this Contract for helium, sulfur, CO, other non-hydrocarbons, or for Inferior Liquids.
5.1
Consideration
.
2
     (a) The net Residue Gas value will be the month's average of each day's Platts mid-point prices posted for the delivery month for "Daily Price Survey" Permian Basin Area  Waha ("Daily Index Price"), less $0.06 per MMBtu.
5.2
Residue Gas Value
.
Gas Daily
     (b) If the Index Price or Daily Index Price quotation is discontinued or materially modified, its successor shall be used, or in the absence of a successor, Buyer and Seller shall promptly select another publication that enables calculation of an Index Price or Daily Index Price closely comparable to that previously used. If the Daily Index Price is discontinued or materially modified, Buyer or Seller will inform the other party by written notice, stating its proposed changes and the reason for the changes.
     Seller has reserved title to the NGLs extracted from Seller's gas under Section 2 above. Seller shall take its NGLs in kind at the plant tailgate of the plant where processing occurs. Seller elects to sell to Buyer, and Buyer agrees to purchase, market, and sell, the NGLs taken in kind by Seller attributable to Seller's gas at the Plant tailgate for the consideration stated in this Section 5.
5.3
NGL Marketing Option
.
     The net value of NGLs attributable to Seller will be the simple average of the midpoint of the daily high/low spot price for (i) purity ethane, (ii) non-TET propane, (iii) non-TET isobutane, (iv) non-TET normal butane, and (v) non-TET natural gasoline (pentanes and heavier) during the month as reported for Mont Belvieu, Texas published by the (or in its absence, a comparable successor publication designated by Buyer and agreed by Seller) less Buyer's actual reasonable TF&S costs relating to the movement to and disposition of Seller's NGLs using transportation on the E-Z and other NGL lines for deliveries to Sweeny, Texas, Mont Belvieu,
5.4 (a)
NGL Value
.
Oil Price Information Service
 
Texas, or other similarly-priced fractionator market centers mutually agreed by both parties, and less a $0.0025/gallon NGL marketing fee. For purposes of these TF&S cost calculations, Buyer will use a cost and volume weighting of 50% each for costs incurred for NGL handling downstream from (i) the Buyer-operated Ozona Gas Plant and (ii) Buyer's Southwest Ozona Gas Plant. If a change in downstream NGL pipeline specifications causes a failure to meet the revised NGLs quality specifications and Buyer incurs NGL off quality fees as a result, Buyer will so notify Seller, and the parties shall then negotiate an equitable solution of the problem. Seller recognizes that Affiliates of Buyer may be involved in handling NGLs downstream from the Plant, and acknowledges that the reasonable good faith prices or fees so established will nevertheless control.
     (b) . Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 5, during and following a hurricane or other event of Force Majeure or an inability to market NGLs on resale due to lack of available NGL pipeline or fractionation capacity that affects Buyer's NGLs resale markets, Buyer may elect in view of the resulting supply or market volatility that Seller's NGLs be priced (i) using Seller's pro rata share of actual NGLs recoveries in lieu of the fixed recoveries provided in Section 5.6 below, and (ii) using the actual NGLs prices that Buyer received on resale in lieu of pricing under subsection (a) above. Buyer shall provide Seller prompt information on any alternate pricing election under this subsection. Alternate pricing under this subsection will expire when Buyer's NGLs resale markets have, in the reasonable determination of Buyer and Seller, recovered from the effects of the Force Majeure event to the extent that buyer is able to resume normal NGLs resales reasonably free from market distortions caused by the Force Majeure event and without NGLs resale capacity restraints.
Alternate NGLs Pricing for Force Majeure Events
OPIS
     (c) . Notwithstanding any other provision in this Contract to the contrary, if as a result of one or more incidents of Force Majeure Buyer is unable to accept and purchase all of Seller's gas committed hereunder, or if Buyer is unable to market and sell all of the NGLs extracted from such gas, each at the full price set forth in this Section 5, and the cumulative period of Force Majeure exceeds 225 cumulative Days during the primary term or 45 cumulative Days during any renewal term, then Seller, upon providing documentation, shall have the right to terminate this Contract as of the end of a month upon 15 Days written notice to Buyer.
Force Majeure Termination
     Whenever the month's volume delivered to Buyer at any Delivery Point is less than 450 Mcf, Buyer will charge Seller a low volume fee of per low volume month per affected Delivery Point. Buyer may deduct this fee from any proceeds payable to Seller or may invoice Seller for the amount due, to be paid by Seller within 20 Days of the invoice date. Seller may cease application of low volume fees under this Section by giving Buyer 30 Days advance
5.5

.
$300.00
 
written notice of Seller's request to have the affected meters disconnected. The low volume fees will no longer apply as of the end of the notice period, and Buyer may disconnect the affected meters.
     Buyer will determine the residue gas and NGLs attributable to Seller using the following definitions and procedures. From time to time Buyer may make changes and adjustments in its allocation methods to improve accuracy or efficiency.
5.6
Allocation of Residue Gas and NGLs
.
a. . The Delivery Point Volume will be the quantity of gas delivered by Seller to Buyer at the inlets of Buyer Facilities at the Delivery Points.
Delivery Point Volume
b. . Seller's Plant Inlet Volume in MMBtu is Seller's Delivery Point Volume in MMBtu less for field fuel and line loss.
Seller's Plant Inlet Volume
1%
c. . Buyer will determine the quantity of each NGL component attributable to Seller's gas by multiplying Seller's Plant Inlet Volume in Mcf by the gallons of each component contained in the gas delivered by Seller at each Delivery Point by the following fixed recovery percentages:
Determination of NGL Volumes
d. . The MMBtus of Residue Gas attributable to Seller will be the sum of the MMBtus of methane and heavier hydrocarbons contained in the Seller's Plant Inlet Volume, less the MMBtus contained in the NGL gallons allocated to Seller's gas under 5.5(c) above using the industry-accepted Btu/gallon content for each NGL component, and less of Seller's Plant Inlet Volume in MMBtus as a deduction for plant fuel, losses, and unaccountables.
Residue Gas Attributable to Seller
3%
e. . Whenever Force Majeure or maintenance needs prevent normal gathering or processing operations for Seller's gas for more than 10 days in any calendar month, Buyer may elect to allocate Seller's attributable NGL gallons and Residue Gas will be based on Seller's proportional share of actual gathering and processing results during those periods. Buyer will include the adjusted overall monthly recoveries in its monthly gas statement to Seller.
Force Majeure, Maintenance
     (a) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5, if at any time, and from time to time, Buyer reasonably demonstrates through information provided to Seller that its taking and handling of gas from any or all Delivery Points under this Contract are or are about to become unprofitable to Buyer, Buyer may notify Seller of Buyer's intent to renegotiate Seller's Table 5.1 percentages as to all or certain affected Delivery Points, upon at least 90 Days advance written notice from buyer to Seller prior to the proposed effective date of the change, which shall be as of the first of a month. If Buyer proposes a different Table 5.1 percentage and Seller is not willing to accept the percentage nominated by Buyer as reasonable, then as to all gas affected by Buyer's notice for which the parties do not agree, Seller shall have the right to terminate this Contract upon written
5.7
Unprofitable Situations
.
 
notice to Buyer. Buyer agrees not to exercise this right during the first 36 months of the term of this Contract.
     (b) If this Contract is terminated in its entirety or with respect to the committed acreage upstream of any Delivery Point pursuant to this Section 5.7, Buyer shall be obligated to offer to enter into a written agreement with Seller to receive the gas produced form the acreage affected by the termination at the applicable Delivery Point and redeliver thermally equivalent quantities (less actual fuel and line loss not to exceed 5%) to the tailgate of the plant. Buyer's offer must be made in writing within five (5) business Days of such termination and remain open for acceptance by Seller for a period of at least ten (10) business Days after the offer is made.
     This Contract shall be in force from and after its execution and shall remain in effect for a primary term expiring five (5) years following the last Day of the month in which this Contract is executed, and will continue in effect from year to year thereafter until canceled by either party as of the end of the primary term or as of any anniversary thereafter by giving the other party at least 60 Days' but no more than 120 Days' advance written notice of termination.

B.3
Options to Compress
.
 
Seller reserves the following rights with respect to its interests in the oil and gas properties committed by Seller to Buyer under this Contract together with sufficient gas to satisfy those rights:
C.1
Reservations
.
(a) To operate the oil and gas properties free from control by Buyer as Seller in Seller's sole discretion deems advisable, including without limitation the right, but never the obligation, to drill new wells, to repair and rework old wells, renew or extend, in whole or in part, any oil and gas lease covering any of the committed properties, and to abandon any well or surrender any oil and gas lease, in whole or in part, when Seller no longer deems it capable of producing gas in paying quantities under normal methods of operation.
(b) To use gas for developing and operating the committed oil and gas properties and to fulfill obligations to Seller's lessors for those properties.
(c) To pool, combine, and unitize any of Seller's oil and gas properties with other properties in the same field, and to alter pooling, combinations, or units; this Contract will then cover Seller's allocated interest in unitized production insofar as that interest is attributable to the oil and gas properties committed under this Contract, and the description of the property committed will be considered to have been amended accordingly.
(d) To retain oil and liquid hydrocarbons separated from the gas, prior to delivery to Buyer at the Delivery Point(s), by the use of conventional mechanical separators.
Subject to Section C.1, Seller will not engage in any operation, including without limitation reinjection, recycling, or curtailment, that would materially reduce the amount of gas available for sale to Buyer except upon 60 Days advance written notice to Buyer, or as much advance notice as is feasible under the circumstances.
C.2
Exception
.
Buyer will own, maintain, and operate orifice meters or other measuring devices of standard make at or near the Delivery Points. Except as otherwise stated in this Section D, Buyer will install orifice meters or other measurement devices and compute volumes in accordance with accepted industry practice. Buyer may re-use metering equipment not meeting current standards but meeting 1985 or later published standards for gas sources not expected to deliver in excess of 100 Mcf per Day. A party providing compression facilities will also provide sufficient pulsation dampening equipment customary to the industry to prevent pulsation from affecting measurement at the Delivery Points. This equipment will not unreasonably be requested. The parties may use electronic recording devices. Seller will have access to Buyer's metering equipment at reasonable hours, but only Buyer will calibrate, adjust, operate, and maintain it.
D.1
Buyer to Install Meters
.
The unit of volume will be one cubic foot of gas at a base temperature of 60 F. and at a pressure base of 14.73 psia. Computations of volumes will follow industry accepted practice.
D.2
Unit of Volume
.
Buyer may measure the atmospheric pressure or may assume the atmospheric pressure to be 13.2 psia. Buyer may determine the gas temperature by using a recording thermometer; otherwise, the temperature will be assumed to be 60 F.
D.3
Pressure, Temperature
.
Seller may install, maintain, and operate in accordance with accepted industry practice at its own expense pressure regulators and check measuring equipment of standard make using separate taps. Check meters shall not interfere with operation of Buyer's equipment. Buyer will have access to Seller's check measuring equipment at all reasonable hours, but only Seller will calibrate, adjust, operate, and maintain it.
D.4
Check Meters
.
At least semiannually, Buyer will verify the accuracy of Buyer's measuring equipment, and Seller or its lease operator will verify the accuracy of any check measuring equipment. If Seller's lease operator or Buyer notifies the other that it desires a special test of any measuring equipment, they will cooperate to secure a prompt verification of the accuracy of the equipment. If either party at any time observes a variation between the delivery meter and the check meter, it will promptly notify the other, and both will then cooperate to secure an immediate verification of the accuracy of the equipment. Buyer will give Seller's lease operator reasonable advance notice of the time of all special tests and calibrations of meters and of sampling for determinations of gas composition and quality, so that the lease operator may have representatives present to witness tests and sampling or make joint tests and obtain samples with its own equipment. Seller will give or cause its lease operator to give reasonable advance notice to Buyer of the time of tests and calibrations of any check meters and of non-routine sampling by Seller for determination of gas composition and quality. Seller may request sampling and analysis of Buyer's measuring equipment more frequently than semi-annually. If Seller so requests, Seller or its lease operator must be present when the special sample is captured and authorize the test in writing. If new sample differs materially (i.e. the stated methane or any NGL component's result changes by more than 2% from the previous test), Buyer will absorb the cost of the sample and analysis. If the new sample results do not differ materially from the previous test under the preceding sentence, Seller will absorb the cost of the sample and analysis.
D.5
Meter Tests
.
If at any time any of the measuring or testing equipment is found out of service or registering inaccurately in any percentage, the measuring party will adjusted it promptly to read accurately within the limits prescribed by the manufacturer. If any measuring equipment is found to be inaccurate or out of service by an amount exceeding the greater of (i) 2.0 percent at a
D.6
Correction of Errors
.
 
recording corresponding to the average hourly rate of flow for the period since the last test, or (ii) 100 Mcf per month, the measuring party will correct previous readings to zero error for any known or agreed period. Buyer will determine the volume of gas delivered during that period by the first feasible of the following methods:
(i) Using the data recorded by any check measuring equipment if registering accurately;
(ii) Correcting the error if the percentage of error is ascertainable by calibration, test, or mathematical calculation; or
(iii) Using deliveries under similar conditions during a period when the equipment was registering accurately.
No adjustment will be made for inaccuracies unless they exceed the greater of (i) 2.0 percent of affected volumes, or (ii) 100 Mcf per month.
The parties will preserve for a period of at least two years all test data, charts, and similar measurement records. The parties will raise metering questions as soon as practicable after the time of production. No party will have any obligation to preserve metering records for more than two years except to the extent that a metering question has been raised in writing and remains unresolved.
D.7
Meter Records
.
          At least monthly, Buyer will obtain a representative sample of Seller's gas delivered at each Delivery Point; Buyer may use spot sampling, continuous samplers, or on-line chromatography. By chromatography or other accepted method in the industry, Buyer will determine the composition, gravity, and gross heating value of the hydrocarbon components of Seller's gas in Btu per cubic foot on a dry basis at standard conditions, then adjust the result for the water vapor content of the gas (by either the volume or Btu content method) using an industry accepted practice. No adjustment will be made if the water content of the gas is less than seven (7) pounds. No heating value will be credited for Btus in HS or other non-hydrocarbon components. Buyer will make the first determination of Btu content for Seller's deliveries within a reasonable time after deliveries of gas begin. If Buyer uses a continuous sampler or on-line chromatography, the determinations will apply to the gas delivered while the sampler was installed. If not, the determination will apply until the first Day of the month following the next determination.
2
The gas shall be merchantable natural gas, at all times complying with the following quality requirements. The gas shall be commercially free of crude oil, water in the liquid phase, brine, air, dust, gums, gum-forming constituents, bacteria, and other objectionable liquids and solids, and not contain more than:
F.1
Quality Specifications
.
(a) 1/4 grain of HS per 100 cubic feet.
2
(b) Five grains of total sulfur nor more than one grain of mercaptan per 100 cubic feet.
(c) Two mole percent of carbon dioxide.
(d) Three mole percent of nitrogen.
(e) Zero parts per million by volume of oxygen, and not have been subjected to any treatment or process that permits or causes the admission of oxygen, that dilutes the gas, or otherwise causes it to fail to meet these quality specifications.
(f) Five mole percent of combined carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and oxygen.
The gas shall:
(g) Not exceed 120F in temperature at the Delivery Point.
(h) Have a total heating value of at least 1,050 Btus per cubic foot.
(i) If a third party pipeline receiving the gas delivered has more stringent quality specifications than those stated above, Seller's gas shall conform to the more stringent pipeline quality standard.
Buyer will make determinations of conformity of the gas with the above specifications using procedures generally accepted in the gas industry as often as Buyer reasonably deems necessary. If in the lease operator's judgment the result of any test or determination is inaccurate, Buyer upon request will again conduct the questioned test or determination. Seller will bear the costs of the additional test or determination unless it shows the original test or determination to have been materially inaccurate.
F.2
Quality Tests
.
Seller will employ only conventional mechanical separation equipment at all production sites covered by this Contract. Low temperature, absorption, and similar separation facilities are not considered conventional mechanical separation equipment. Except for liquids removed through operation of conventional mechanical separators and except for removal of substances as required to enable Seller to comply with this Section F, Seller will remove no components of the gas prior to delivery to Buyer.
F.3
Separation Equipment
.
If any of the gas delivered by Seller fails to meet the quality specifications stated in this Section F, Buyer may at its option accept delivery of and pay for the gas or discontinue or curtail taking of gas at any Delivery Point whenever its quality does not conform to the quality specifications. If
F.4
Rights as to Off Specification Gas
.
 
Buyer accepts delivery of off specification gas from Seller or incurs costs relating to inferior gas quality in its gathering system, Buyer will deduct from the proceeds otherwise payable a fee of $0.05/Mcf plus $0.02 times the total mole percent, and any fraction of a mole percent, of HS and CO times the Mcf quantity delivered at the affected off quality Delivery Points. If Buyer rejects delivery, Buyer's notice to that effect will terminate this Contract with respect to the off specification gas named in the notice. If Buyer accepts delivery of gas from Seller that is off specification for nitrogen content, Buyer will deduct a fee of $0.06/Mcf for each mole percent, and each fraction of a mole percent, of nitrogen content over the allowed nitrogen specification for all volumes delivered by Seller at the affected excess nitrogen Delivery Points. As of the beginning of each calendar year beginning with 2011, Buyer will adjust the current year's off-specification fees upward or downward, but not below the initial fees, by an amount equal to the annual percentage change in the preliminary estimate of the implicit price deflator, seasonally adjusted, for the gross domestic product ("GDP") as computed and most recently published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, rounded to the nearest 100 cent, or in its absence, a similar successor adjustment factor designated by Buyer.

th
Buyer will furnish to Seller on or before the twenty-fifth (25) Day of each month a statement showing the volume of gas and NGLs delivered by or allocated to Seller during the previous month and Buyer's calculation of the amounts due under this Contract for the previous month's deliveries. Buyer will pay Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds on or before the last business Day of each month, for all gas and NGLs delivered by or allocated to Seller during the preceding month. As between the parties, late payments by Buyer and recoupments/refunds from Seller will carry simple interest at the lower of 6% per annum or the maximum lawful interest rate; provided that no interest will accrue as to monthly principal amounts of less than $1,000 due for less than one year when paid. The parties waive any rights to differing interest rates. Except as limited in Section G.2 below, Buyer may recover any uncontested overpayments or collect any uncontested amounts due from Seller to Buyer under this Contract by deducting them from proceeds payable to Seller.

Audit Rights; Time Limit to Assert Claims
.
(a) Each party will have the right during reasonable business hours to examine the books, records and charts of the other party to the extent necessary to verify performance of this Contract and the accuracy of any payment, statement, charge, or computation upon execution of a reasonable confidentiality agreement. If any audit examination or review of the party's own records reveals an inaccuracy in any payment, Buyer will promptly make the appropriate adjustment.
(b) No adjustment for any billing or payment shall be made, and payments shall be final after the lapse of two years from their due date except as to matters that either party has noted in a specific written objection to the other party in writing during the period, unless within the two year period Buyer has made the appropriate correction. However, Seller's responsibilities for severance taxes and third party liabilities and related interest are not affected by this subsection.
two year
(c) No party will have a right to recoup or recover prior overpayments or underpayments that result from errors that occur in spite of good faith performance if the amounts involved do not exceed $10/month/meter. Either party may require prospective correction of such errors.
Buyer will not be required to furnish gas volume records relating to electronic recording devices for gas meters other than daily volume information unless there are indications the meter was not operating properly.

Metering Records Availability
.
Subject to Section 5.4 (c) of the Contract, if either party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, by Force Majeure to carry out its obligations under this Contract, other than to make payments due, the obligations of that party, so far as they are affected by Force Majeure, will be suspended during the continuance of any inability so caused, but for no longer period.
H.1
Suspension of Performance
.
"Force Majeure" means acts of God, strikes, lockouts or other industrial disturbances, acts of the public enemy, wars, blockades, insurrections, riots, epidemics, landslides, lightning, earthquakes, storms, floods, washouts, arrests and restraints of governments and people, civil disturbances, fires, explosions, breakage or accidents to machinery or lines of pipe, freezing of wells or lines of pipe, partial or entire failure of wells or sources of supply of gas, inability to obtain at reasonable cost servitudes, right of way grants, permits, governmental approvals or licenses, inability to obtain at reasonable cost materials or supplies for constructing or maintaining facilities, and other causes, whether of the kind listed above or otherwise, not within the control of the party claiming suspension and which by the exercise of reasonable diligence the party is unable to prevent or overcome.
H.2
Force Majeure Definition
.
The settlement of strikes or lockouts will be entirely within the discretion of the party having the difficulty, and settlement of strikes, lockouts, or other labor disturbances is not required when the affected party considers it inadvisable.
H.3
Labor Matters Exception
.
 
          Seller warrants that it has good title and processing rights to the gas delivered, free and clear of any and all liens, encumbrances, and claims, or that Seller has good right and lawful authority to sell the same. Seller grants to Buyer the right to process Seller's gas for extraction of NGLs and other valuable components. If Seller's title or right to receive any payment is questioned or involved in litigation, upon notice, Buyer will have the right to withhold the contested payments without interest until title information is received, during the litigation, until the title or right to receive the questioned payments is freed from question, or until Seller furnishes security for repayment acceptable to Buyer. Without impairment of Seller's warranty of title to gas and gas processing rights, if Seller owns or controls less than full title to the gas delivered, Buyer will make payments only in the proportion that Seller's interest bears to the entire title to the gas.
          Seller is responsible for all payments to the owners of all working interests, mineral interests, royalties, overriding royalties, bonus payments, production payments, and the like. Buyer assumes no liabilities or duties to Seller's working or mineral interest, royalty, or other interest owners under this Contract.
Reimbursement to Seller for Seller's full liability for severance and similar taxes levied upon Seller's gas production is included in the prices payable under this Contract, regardless of whether some included interests may be exempt from taxation.
K.1
Included in Price
.
Seller shall bear, and unless otherwise required by law, will pay to taxing authorities all severance, production, excise, sales, gross receipts, occupation, and other taxes imposed upon Seller with respect to the gas on or prior to delivery to Buyer. Buyer will bear and pay all taxes imposed upon Buyer with respect to the gas after delivery to Buyer; however, if Buyer incurs any charge on the carbon or MMBtu content of Seller's gas, whether in the form of a "cap and trade" system, tax, or other impost, the parties shall promptly negotiate in good faith an equitable resolution of the matter, to be effective as of the initial effective date of the new or additional tax burden.

SELLER RELEASES AND AGREES TO DEFEND, INDEMNIFY, AND SAVE BUYER, ITS AFFILIATES, AND THEIR OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL CLAIMS, CAUSES OF ACTION, LIABILITIES, AND COSTS (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS OF INVESTIGATION AND DEFENSE) CAUSED BY ANY BREACH OF SECTIONS I, J, AND K ABOVE.
L.2
Responsibility for Injury or Damage
. As between the parties, Seller will be in control and possession of the gas deliverable hereunder and responsible for any injury or damage relating to handling or delivery of gas until the gas has been delivered to Buyer at the Delivery Points; after delivery, Buyer will be deemed to be in exclusive control and possession and responsible for any injury or damage relating to handling or gathering of gas. THE PARTY HAVING RESPONSIBILITY UNDER THE PRECEDING SENTENCE SHALL RELEASE, DEFEND, INDEMNIFY, AND HOLD THE OTHER PARTY, ITS AFFILIATES, AND THEIR OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL CLAIMS, CAUSES OF ACTION, LIABILITIES, AND COSTS (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS OF INVESTIGATION AND DEFENSE) ARISING FROM ACTUAL AND ALLEGED LOSS OF GAS, PERSONAL INJURY, DEATH, AND DAMAGE FOR WHICH THE PARTY IS RESPONSIBLE UNDER THIS SECTION; PROVIDED THAT NEITHER PARTY WILL BE INDEMNIFIED FOR ITS OWN NEGLIGENCE OR THAT OF ITS AGENTS, SERVANTS, EMPLOYEES OR CONTRACTORS.
          Insofar as Seller's lease or leases permit and insofar as Seller or its lease operator may have any rights however derived (whether from an oil and gas lease, easement, governmental agency order, regulation, statute, or otherwise), Seller grants to Buyer and Buyer's gas gathering contractor, if any, and their assignees the right of free entry and the right to lay and maintain pipelines, meters, and any equipment on the lands or leases subject to this Contract as reasonably necessary in connection with the purchase or handling of Seller's gas. Subject to the limitations above, upon written request from Buyer to Seller, Seller shall grant, in writing, to Buyer or Buyer's designee, recordable rights of ingress and egress as necessary or appropriate for the purposes of complying with the terms of this Contract. All pipelines, meters, and other equipment placed by Buyer or Buyer's contractors on the lands and leases will remain the property of the owner and may be removed by the
 
owner at any time consistent with its obligations under this Contract. Without limitation, Buyer or its gathering contractor may disconnect and remove measurement and other facilities from any Delivery Point if this Contract is terminated with respect to all production connected upstream of such Delivery Point.
Either party may assign this Contract. This Contract is binding upon and inures to the benefit of the successors, assigns, heirs, personal representatives, and representatives in bankruptcy of the parties, and, subject to any prior dedications by the assignee, shall be binding upon any purchaser of Buyer's Facilities and upon any purchaser of the properties of Seller subject to this Contract. Nothing contained in this Section will prevent either party from mortgaging its rights as security for its indebtedness, but security is subordinate to the parties' rights and obligations under this Contract.
N.1
Binding on Assignees
.
Seller will make any assignment or sublease of any oil and gas properties or any gas rights contracted to Buyer expressly subject to this Contract. No transfer of or succession to the interest of Seller, however made, will bind Buyer unless and until the original instrument or other proper proof that the claimant is legally entitled to an interest has been furnished to Buyer at its Division Order address noted in the Notices Section or subsequent address.
N.2
Notice of Assignment

A waiver by a party of any one or more defaults by the other in the performance of any provisions of this Contract will not operate as a waiver of any future default or defaults, whether of a like or different character.
O.2
Default and Nonwaiver
.
This Contract may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which will be considered together as one instrument, and this Contract will be binding upon all parties executing it, whether or not executed by all parties owning an interest in the producing sources affected by this Contract. Signed copies of this Contract and facsimiles of it shall have the same force and effect as originals.
O.3
Counterparts
.
The language of this Contract shall not be construed in favor of or against either party, but shall be construed as if the language were drafted mutually by both parties. This Contract constitutes the final and complete agreement between the parties. There are no oral promises, prior agreements, understandings, obligations, warranties, or representations between the parties relating to this Contract other than those stated herein. All waivers, modifications, amendments, and changes to this Contract shall be in writing and signed by the authorized representatives of the parties. The relations between the parties are those of independent contractors; this Contract creates no joint venture, partnership, association, other special relationship, nor any fiduciary obligations. There are no third party beneficiaries of Buyer's sales contracts or of this Contract.
O.4
Negotiations; Entire Agreement; Amendment; No Third Party Beneficiaries
.
. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Buyer has no duty under this Contract to purchase or handle gas attributable to production from interests of third parties that has been purchased by Seller for resale, except that Buyer will purchase Other WI Gas. "Other WI Gas" means gas attributable to working and mineral interests owned by third parties in wells operated by Seller that are subject to this Contract that Seller has the right to purchase or market under an operating agreement. If Buyer requests in writing that Seller obtain ratification of this Contract from owners of Other WI Gas, Seller will use reasonable commercial efforts to cause those Other WI Gas owners to execute and deliver to Buyer an instrument prepared by Buyer for the purpose of ratifying and adopting this Contract with respect to the owner's Other WI Gas, and the ratifying owner will become a party to this Contract with like force and effect as though the Other WI owner had executed this Contract as amended as of the time of the ratification, and the terms of this Contract as then amended will become binding upon Buyer and the ratifying owner.

CONTRACT OR ITS PERFORMANCE OR NONPERFORMANCE.
The parties desire to resolve any disputes that may arise informally if possible. To that end, if a dispute arises, the party raising the issue will give written notice of the issue or issues to the other party and each party will appoint a senior employee or executive to negotiate with the other party concerning the dispute. If the dispute cannot be so resolved in a reasonable time, the parties may agree to non-binding mediation or binding arbitration, or either party may file a suit to resolve the matter. Any suit relating in any way to this Contract must be filed only in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in Harris, Midland, or Tarrant Counties, Texas, and in no other forum. Each of the parties (a) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any court having jurisdiction sitting in those counties for the purposes of any suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and (b) waives, and agrees not to assert in any suit, action, or proceeding, any claim that: (i) it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of competent jurisdiction in that county or of any other court to which proceedings in those courts may be appealed; (ii) the suit, action, or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum; or that (iii) the venue of the suit, action, or proceeding is improper.

The purchase price under the Purchase Agreement was $76.0 million, subject to customary adjustments, with an effective date of December 1, 2010.
     The Purchase Agreement is filed herewith as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Purchase Agreement.

Funding was provided through borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility and cash on hand.
     The Purchase Agreement is filed herewith as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

(c) The indemnifying party shall obtain the prior written approval of the Indemnitee, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, before making any settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment of the validity of any Third Party Claim or any liability in respect thereof if, pursuant to or as a result of such settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment, injunctive or other equitable relief would be imposed against the Indemnitee or if, in the opinion of the Indemnitee, such settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment could have an adverse effect on its business, operations, assets or financial condition. No indemnifying party shall consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to each Indemnitee of a full and unconditional release from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim.
. No indemnifying party shall have any obligation to indemnify an Indemnitee from and against any Indemnified Claim under , other than Indemnified Claims resulting by reason of any fraud, intentional misrepresentation, Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities, unless (i) any individual Indemnified Claim suffered by such Indemnitee is greater than or equal to Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) in value (the "in which event such Indemnitee may recover with respect to such individual Indemnified Claim to the extent the value of such Indemnified Claim exceeds the Individual Indemnification Deductible or (ii) the aggregate value of all Indemnified Claims suffered by such Indemnitee (without regard to the Individual Deductible) exceeds Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) (the "") in which event such Indemnitee may recover all Indemnification Claims incurred in excess of the Aggregate Deductible.

Exhibit 99.1
For Immediate Release March 1, 2011
     FORT WORTH, TEXAS, March 1, 2011  Approach Resources Inc. (NASDAQ: AREX) today reported year-end 2010 estimated proved reserves and 2010 production. Highlights for year-end 2010 estimated proved reserves include:
2010 Proved Reserves
     Year-end 2010 estimated proved reserves totaled 50.7 MMBoe, an increase of 39% compared to year-end 2009 proved reserves of 36.5 MMBoe. Proved oil and NGL reserves grew 204% to 25.7 MMBbls, up from 8.4 MMBbls at year end 2009. Approach's year-end 2010 proved reserves are 51% oil and NGLs and 49% natural gas, compared to 23% oil and NGLs and 77% natural gas at year end 2009. Proved developed reserves grew by 66% to 25.8 MMBoe and now represent 51% of the proved reserve base, compared to 43% at year end 2009. At December 31, 2010, 95% of the Company's proved reserves were located in our core operating area in the Permian Basin.
     Year-end 2010 estimated proved reserves do not include the potential from our emerging Wolffork oil shale resource play or from the acquisition of an additional 38% working interest in our Cinco Terry field in Crockett County, Texas, announced today.
 
     The following table is a reconciliation of the changes in our proved reserves between December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2010:
     Planned processing upgrades after the first quarter of 2011 contributed to the increase in proved reserves at year end 2010. As previously announced, after March 2011 our current, wellhead gas purchase contract will expire and we will begin realizing NGL revenues from the liquids-rich gas stream in Ozona Northeast. Development drilling and planned processing upgrades in Cinco Terry, acquisition of an additional 10% working interest in Cinco Terry in October 2010 and improved pricing also contributed to the increase in proved reserves at December 31, 2010.
     The standardized after-tax measure of discounted future net cash flows ("Standardized Measure") for our proved reserves at December 31, 2010, was $204.2 million. The PV-10, or pre-tax present value of our proved reserves discounted at 10%, was estimated at $325.8 million. The independent engineering firm DeGolyer and MacNaughton prepared our estimates of year-end 2010 proved reserves and PV-10. PV-10 is a non-GAAP measure. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures" below for our definition of PV-10 and a reconciliation to the Standardized Measure (GAAP). Estimates of proved reserves and PV-10 were prepared using $4.38 per MMBtu of natural gas, $79.40 per Bbl of oil and $39.25 per Bbl of NGLs.
Preliminary Estimates of Costs Incurred
     Preliminary, unaudited estimates of costs incurred during 2010 totaled $90 million, and included $59.8 million for exploration and development drilling, $21.2 million for the purchase of additional working interest in Cinco Terry and $9 million for acreage acquisitions. Based on 2010 total costs incurred of $90 million and net proved reserve additions of 15.8 MMBoe, all-in finding and development ("F&D") costs were $5.70 per Boe. Based on 2010 exploration and development costs incurred of $59.8 million and proved reserve extensions and discoveries of 3.8 MMBoe, drill-bit F&D costs were $15.85 per Boe. F&D cost is a non-GAAP measure. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures" below for our definition of F&D costs and a reconciliation to the information required by ASC 932-235.
2010 Production and Operations
     Production for the fourth quarter of 2010 totaled 436 MBoe (4.7 MBoe/d), compared to 332 MBoe (3.6 MBoe/d) in the fourth quarter of 2009, a 31% increase. Oil and NGL production for the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 69% to 162 MBbls, compared to 96 MBbls produced in the fourth quarter of
 
2009. Production for the fourth quarter of 2010 was 63% natural gas and 37% oil and NGLs, compared to 71% natural gas and 29% oil and NGLs in the fourth quarter of 2009. During the fourth quarter 2010, we drilled a total of 19 gross (11.7 net) wells. At December 31, 2010, five gross (3.5 net wells) were waiting on completion, all of which have since been completed as producers.
     Production for 2010 totaled 1,556 MBoe (4.3 MBoe/d), compared to 1,468 MBoe (4 MBoe/d) in 2009, a 6% increase. Oil and NGL production for 2010 increased 22% to 508 MBbls, compared to 415 MBbls produced in 2009. Production for 2010 was 67% natural gas and 33% oil and NGLs, compared to 72% natural gas and 28% oil and NGLs in 2009. During 2010, we drilled a total of 91 gross (56.2 net) wells with a 100% success rate.
Operations Update
     We continue our pilot program testing the Clearfork and Wolfcamp formations with three Canyon-Wolffork vertical new drill wells and two Wolfcamp vertical recompletions.
     Pilot Wells A, B and C were drilled and completed in the Canyon and Wolffork zones, each with five fracture stimulation stages. We recompleted Pilot Wells D and E in the Wolfcamp zone, with two and three fracture stimulation stages, respectively. A table summarizing the results of the recent pilot wells is below. The "Max IP" represents the peak 24-hour rate, and "Stabilized IP" represents the five-day average daily production after the wells have recovered, on average, 40% of fracture stimulation fluids.
Management Comment
     J. Ross Craft, the Company's President and CEO, commented, "We are very encouraged by the initial results of these vertical pilot wells. By comparison, our studies show that average initial producing rates from vertical wells in the Wolfberry play to our north range from 50 Boe/d to 75 Boe/d. Four out of our five wells were consistent with or exceeded this range. Also, in this pilot phase, we continued to modify our approach to frac design and post-completion operations, which we believe are key drivers to our success in the Wolffork. Next on our schedule is our first Wolfcamp horizontal pilot well, which we expect to complete in mid-March."
     As previously announced, our 2011 drilling program includes operating one rig to drill 11 horizontal wells targeting the Wolfcamp Shale, one rig to drill 19 vertical wells targeting the Wolffork and Canyon Sands, one rig to drill 26 vertical wells targeting the Canyon Sands (which we expect to recomplete in the Wolffork in 2012), and one workover rig to recomplete 10 wells in the Wolffork. As a result of the acquisition of the remaining 38% working interest in Cinco Terry announced separately today, our
 
working interest in these wells will be approximately 100%. Our objectives for our 2011 drilling program continue to be to delineate the Clearfork and Wolfcamp zones across our acreage position in the Permian Basin, improve initial production rates by refining our stimulation strategy, advance our understanding of optimal well spacing and hydrocarbon recovery and improve our cost structure.
     We currently are running one horizontal rig and two vertical rigs in the Permian Basin. As noted above, we expect to complete our first horizontal Wolfcamp well, with a lateral length of 5,377 feet, in mid-March 2011. We drilled our second horizontal Wolfcamp well to our targeted lateral length of 8,516 feet; however, mechanical issues required us to plug back the lateral portion of the well. We currently are preparing to drill a sidetrack well. Estimated production for the first quarter through February 28, 2011, has averaged 4.7 MBoe/d. Production for the first quarter of 2011 was negatively impacted by severe weather.
     is an independent oil and gas company with core operations, production and reserves located in the Permian Basin in West Texas. The Company targets multiple oil and liquids-rich formations in the Permian Basin, where the Company operates approximately 133,000 net acres. At December 31, 2010, the Company's estimated proved reserves were 50.7 million barrels of oil equivalent, 51% oil and NGLs and 49% natural gas. For more information about the Company, please visit .

This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this press release that address activities, events or developments that the Company expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, forward-looking statements contained in this press release specifically include expectations of plans, strategies, objectives and anticipated financial and operating results of the Company, including 2011 drilling plans. These statements are based on certain assumptions made by the Company based on management's experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, anticipated future developments and other factors believed to be appropriate. Such statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. Further information on such assumptions, risks and uncertainties is available in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filings. The Company's SEC filings are available on its website at www.approachresources.com. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the Company undertakes no obligation to correct or update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.
     
The SEC permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved, probable and possible reserves that meet the SEC's definitions for such terms, and price and cost sensitivities for such reserves, and prohibits disclosure of resources that do not constitute such reserves. The Company uses the terms "estimated ultimate recovery," "EUR," reserve "potential," "upside" or other descriptions of volumes of reserves potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that the SEC's rules may prohibit the Company from including in filings with the SEC. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of being actually realized by the Company.
     
Information in this release regarding the Standardized Measure and costs incurred for oil and gas properties is unaudited. Final and audited results will be provided in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, to be filed on or before March 16, 2011.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures
     This release contains certain financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. We have provided reconciliations within this release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP that are presented in this release.
PV-10
     The present value of our proved reserves, discounted at 10% ("PV-10"), was estimated at $325.8 million at December 31, 2010, and was calculated based on the first-of-the-month, twelve-month average prices for natural gas, oil and NGLs, of $4.38 per MMBtu of natural gas, $79.40 per Bbl of oil and $39.25 per Bbl of NGLs, respectively.
     PV-10 is our estimate of the present value of future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves after deducting estimated production and ad valorem taxes, future capital costs and operating expenses, but before deducting any estimates of future income taxes. The estimated future net revenues are discounted at an annual rate of 10% to determine their "present value." We believe PV-10 to be an important measure for evaluating the relative significance of our oil and gas properties and that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure of PV-10 provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and investors in evaluating oil and gas companies. Because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid, we believe the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable for evaluating the Company. We believe that PV-10 is a financial measure routinely used and calculated similarly by other companies in the oil and gas industry.
     The following table reconciles PV-10 to our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. PV-10 should not be considered as an alternative to the standardized measure as computed under GAAP.
 
Finding and Development Costs
     are calculated by dividing the sum of property acquisition costs, exploration costs and development costs for the year by the sum of reserve extensions and discoveries, purchases of minerals in place and total revisions for the year.
All-in finding and development ("F&D") costs
     are calculated by dividing the sum of property acquisition costs, exploration costs, development costs and the change in future development costs from the prior year by the sum of reserve extensions and discoveries, purchases of minerals in place and total revisions for the year.
All-in F&D costs, including the change in future development costs,
     are calculated by dividing the sum of exploration costs and development costs for the year by the total of reserve extensions and discoveries for the year.
Drill-bit F&D costs
     We believe that providing the above measures of F&D cost is useful to assist in an evaluation of how much it costs the Company, on a per Boe basis, to add proved reserves. However, these measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our previous SEC filings and to be included in our annual report on Form 10-K to be filed with the SEC on or before March 16, 2011. Due to various factors, including timing differences, F&D costs do not necessarily reflect precisely the costs associated with particular reserves. For example, exploration costs may be recorded in periods before the periods in which related increases in reserves are recorded, and development costs may be recorded in periods after the periods in which related increases in reserves are recorded. In addition, changes in commodity prices can affect the magnitude of recorded increases (or decreases) in reserves independent of the related costs of such increases. All-in F&D costs at December 31, 2010, are materially lower than the Company's historical, all-in F&D costs due to the increase in proved reserves resulting from future processing of NGLs in Ozona Northeast at no additional capital cost.
     As a result of the above factors and various factors that could materially affect the timing and amounts of future increases in reserves and the timing and amounts of future costs, including factors disclosed in our filings with the SEC, we cannot assure you that the Company's future F&D costs will not differ materially from those set forth above. Further, the methods used by us to calculate F&D costs may differ significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, our F&D costs may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.
 
     The following table reconciles our estimated F&D costs for 2010 to the information required by paragraphs 11 and 21 of ASC 932-235:

Exhibit 99.1
     Fort Worth, Texas, March 8, 2011  Approach Resources Inc. (NASDAQ: AREX) today reported financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2010. Highlights for the year ended December 31, 2010, include:
Full Year 2010 Results
     Production for 2010 totaled 1.6 MMBoe (4.3 MBoe/d), compared to 1.5 MMBoe (4 MBoe/d) produced in 2010, an increase of 6%. Oil and NGL production for 2010 increased 22% to 507 MBbls, compared to 415 MBbls produced in 2009. Production for 2010 was 67% natural gas and 33% oil and NGLs, compared to 72% natural gas and 28% oil and NGLs in 2009.
     Net income for 2010 was $7.5 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, on revenues of $57.6 million, compared to a net loss of $5.2 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, on revenues of $40.6 million, for 2009. Of the $17 million increase in revenues in 2010, approximately $12 million was attributable to an increase in prices we received for our natural gas, oil and NGL production, and approximately $5 million was attributable to an increase in production volumes. Net income for 2010 included a realized gain on commodity derivatives of $5.8 million, an impairment of unproved properties of $2.6 million related to our Boomerang project in Southwest Kentucky and an unrealized gain on commodity derivatives of $788,000.
     Excluding the impairment of unproved properties, unrealized gain on commodity derivatives and related income taxes, adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for 2010 was $8.7 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $3.3 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for 2009. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income.
     EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for 2010 was $43 million, or $1.94 per diluted share, compared to $36.7 million, or $1.75 per diluted share, for 2009. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of EBITDAX to net income.
     Average realized prices for 2010, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $4.48 per Mcf of natural gas, $75.67 per Bbl of oil and $41.19 per Bbl of NGLs, compared to $3.70 per Mcf of natural gas, $54.97 per Bbl of oil and $28.32 per Bbl of NGLs, for 2009. Our average realized price, including the effect of commodity derivatives, was $40.72 per Boe for 2010, compared to $37.68 per Boe for 2009.
 
     Lease operating expenses ("LOE") for 2010 were $8.6 million, or $5.50 per Boe, compared to $7.8 million, or $5.30 per Boe, in 2009. The increase in LOE per Boe over the prior year was primarily due to increases in water hauling, insurance and ad valorem taxes, partially offset by a decrease in compressor rental and repair.
     Severance and production taxes for 2010 were $3 million, or 5.2% of oil, NGL and gas sales, compared to $2 million, or 4.9% of oil, NGL and gas sales, in 2009. The increase in production taxes was primarily due to the increase in oil, NGL and gas sales over the prior year period.
     Exploration expense for 2010 was $2.6 million, or $1.66 per Boe, compared to $1.6 million, or $1.10 per Boe, in 2009. Exploration expense for 2010 resulted primarily from 3-D seismic acquisition in Cinco Terry and lease renewals in Ozona Northeast, Cinco Terry and Kentucky.
     Impairment of unproved properties for 2010 was $2.6 million, compared to $3 million in 2009. The 2010 impairment resulted from a write-off of $2.6 million in costs in our Boomerang project in Southwest Kentucky, and represented the remaining carrying value we had recorded for the project. The 2009 impairment resulted from a write-off of $3 million in costs in Northeast British Columbia, and represented the remaining carrying value we had recorded for the project.
     General and administrative expenses ("G&A") for 2010 were $11.4 million, or $7.34 per Boe, compared to $10.6 million, or $7.23 per Boe, for 2009. The increase in G&A was principally due to higher salaries and benefits, including share-based compensation.
     Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense ("DD&A") for 2010 was $22.2 million, or $14.28 per Boe, compared to $24.7 million, or $16.80 per Boe, for 2009. The decrease in DD&A per Boe was primarily attributable to an increase in estimated proved developed reserves at December 31, 2010, partially offset by higher capital costs over the prior year.
Fourth Quarter 2010 Results
     Production for the fourth quarter of 2010 totaled 436 MBoe (4.7 MBoe/d), compared to 333 MBoe (3.6 MBoe/d) in the fourth quarter of 2009, a 31% increase. Oil and NGL production for the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 68% to 161 MBbls, compared to 96 MBbls produced in the fourth quarter of 2009. Production for the fourth quarter of 2010 was 63% natural gas and 37% oil and NGLs, compared to 71% natural gas and 29% oil and NGLs in the fourth quarter of 2009.
     Net income for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $261,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, on revenues of $16.3 million, compared to net loss of $2.3 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, on revenues of $11.9 million, for the fourth quarter of 2009. The $4.4 million increase in revenues in the fourth quarter of 2010 is primarily attributable to an increase in production volumes, and specifically an increase in oil and NGL production volumes. Net income for fourth quarter of 2010 included an impairment of unproved properties of $2.6 million related to our Boomerang project in Southwest Kentucky, a realized gain on commodity derivatives of $2.2 million and an unrealized loss on commodity derivatives of $2.1 million.
     Excluding the impairment of unproved properties, unrealized loss on commodity derivatives and related income taxes, adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $3.4 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $539,000, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2009. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income.
 
     EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $12.1 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, compared to $9.3 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2009. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of EBITDAX to net income.
     Average realized prices for the fourth quarter of 2010, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $3.90 per Mcf of natural gas, $80.91 per Bbl of oil and $44.27 per Bbl of NGLs, compared to $4.56 per Mcf of natural gas, $71.04 per Bbl of oil and $39.73 per Bbl of NGLs, for the fourth quarter of 2009. Our average realized price, including the effect of commodity derivatives, was $42.34 per Boe for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $43.98 per Boe for the fourth quarter of 2009.
     LOE for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $2.5 million, or $5.77 per Boe, compared to $1.8 million, or $5.29 per Boe, in the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase in LOE in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 is primarily due to water hauling, insurance, repairs and maintenance.
     Severance and production taxes for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $944,000, or 5.8% of oil, NGL and gas sales, compared to $604,000, or 5.1% of oil, NGL and gas sales, in the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase in production taxes was primarily due to the increase in oil, NGL and gas sales over the prior year period.
     Exploration expense for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $345,000, compared to $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Exploration expense for the fourth quarter of 2010 resulted primarily from 3-D seismic acquisition and lease renewals in Cinco Terry.
     Impairment of unproved properties for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $2.6 million, compared to $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The fourth quarter of 2010 impairment resulted from a write-off of $2.6 million in costs in our Boomerang project in Southwest Kentucky, and represented the remaining carrying value we had recorded for the project. The fourth quarter of 2009 impairment resulted from a write-off of $3 million in costs in Northeast British Columbia, and represented the remaining carrying value we had recorded for the project.
     G&A for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $3.5 million, or $8.07 per Boe, compared to $3.3 million, or $10.03 per Boe, for the fourth quarter of 2009. The decrease in G&A per BOE is attributable to an increase in production in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to the fourth quarter of 2009.
     DD&A for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $5.5 million, or $12.72 per Boe, compared to $5.9 million, or $17.70 per Boe, for the fourth quarter of 2009. The decrease in DD&A was primarily attributable to an increase in estimated proved developed reserves at December 31, 2010, partially offset by higher capital costs over the prior year.
Capital Expenditures
     Costs incurred during 2010 totaled $90 million, and included $59.8 million for exploration and development drilling, $21.2 million for the purchase of additional working interest in Cinco Terry and $9 million for acreage acquisitions. During 2010, we drilled a total of 91 gross (56.2 net) wells with a 100% success rate. At December 31, 2010, five gross (3.5 net wells) were waiting on completion, all of which have since been completed as producers.
 
     The Company's 2011 capital budget is $220 million. Approximately $130 million of the 2011 capital budget will be allocated to drilling and recompletion projects in the Permian Basin and approximately $90 million will be allocated to the previously announced acquisition of the remaining 38% working interest in Cinco Terry (the "Working Interest Acquisition") and lease extensions, renewals and lease acquisitions in the Permian Basin. The 2011 drilling program includes one rig to drill 11 horizontal wells targeting the Wolfcamp Shale, one rig to drill 19 vertical wells targeting the Wolfcamp Shale and Clearfork formations (the "Wolffork") and Canyon Sands, one rig to drill 26 vertical wells targeting the Canyon Sands (which we expect to recomplete in the Wolffork in 2012), and one workover rig to recomplete 10 wells in the Wolffork. As a result of the Working Interest Acquisition, our working interest in these wells will be approximately 100%.
     Our 2011 capital budget is subject to change depending upon a number of factors, including additional data on our Wolffork oil resource play, results of Wolfcamp Shale and Wolffork drilling and recompletions, economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil, gas and NGLs, the availability of sufficient capital resources for drilling prospects, our financial results and the availability of lease extensions and renewals on reasonable terms.
Liquidity and Commodity Derivatives Update
     We have a $200 million revolving credit agreement with $150 million borrowing base. At December 31, 2010, we had no long-term debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility, and our liquidity was $173.1 million.
     In February 2011, we acquired an additional 38% working interest in Cinco Terry from two non-operating partners for $76 million, subject to usual and customary post-closing adjustments. The Working Interest Acquisition was funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand. At February 28, 2011, we had $67 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility, and our liquidity was $85.1 million. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our calculation of "liquidity."
     We believe we have adequate liquidity from cash generated from operations and unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility for current working capital needs and maintenance of our current drilling program. However, we may determine to access the public or private equity or debt markets for future development of reserves, acquisitions, additional working capital or other liquidity needs, if such financing is available on acceptable terms. We cannot guarantee that such financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all.
     The following table details our commodity derivative positions at December 31, 2010:

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures
     This release contains certain financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. We have provided reconciliations within this release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures here and on the Non-GAAP Financial Information page in the Investor Relations section of our website at .
www.approachresources.com
Adjusted Net Income
     This release contains the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, which exclude the impairment of unproved properties and an unrealized loss (gain) on commodity derivatives and related income taxes. The amounts included in the calculation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share below were computed in accordance with GAAP. We believe adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are useful to investors because they provide readers with a more meaningful measure of our profitability before recording certain items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably determined. However, these measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
 
     The following table reconciles adjusted net income to net income for the three months and year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively (in thousands, except per-share amounts):
EBITDAX
     We define EBITDAX as net income, plus (1) exploration expense, (2) impairment of unproved properties, (3) depletion, depreciation and amortization expense, (4) share-based compensation expense, (5) unrealized loss (gain) on commodity derivatives, (6) interest expense and (7) income taxes. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flow as determined by GAAP. The amounts included in the calculation of EBITDAX were computed in accordance with GAAP. EBITDAX is presented herein and reconciled to the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund development and exploration activities. This measure is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
     The following table reconciles EBITDAX to net income for the three months and year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively (in thousands, except per-share amounts):
 
Liquidity
     Liquidity is calculated by adding the net funds available under our revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents. We use liquidity as an indicator of the Company's ability to fund development and exploration activities. However, this measurement has limitations. This measurement can vary from year to year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the measurement on a company's financial statements. This measurement is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
     The table below summarizes our liquidity at December 31, 2010, and February 28, 2011 (dollars in thousands). Liquidity at February 28, 2011, is preliminary and unaudited.

Exhibit 99.1
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders Approach Resources Inc.
We have audited the accompanying statement of revenue and direct operating expenses of properties acquired by Approach Resources Inc., for the year ended December 31, 2010 ("historical summaries"). The historical summaries are the responsibility of the management of Approach Resources Inc. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the historical summaries based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the historical summaries are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the historical summaries. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall historical summaries presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
The accompanying historical summaries were prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission as described in Note 1 and are not intended to be a complete presentation of the properties' revenues and expenses.
In our opinion, the historical summaries referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the revenues and direct operating expenses of the properties acquired by Approach Resources Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Dallas, Texas April 21, 2011

& ASSOCIATES LLP
 
 
1. Basis of Preparation
     Approach Resources Inc. (together with our subsidiaries, "Approach," the "Company," "we," "us" or "our") is an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development, production and acquisition of oil and gas properties. We focus on finding and developing oil and natural gas reserves in oil shale and tight sands. Our properties are primarily located in the Permian Basin in West Texas. We also own interests in the East Texas Basin and New Mexico.
     The accompanying statement of revenue and direct operating expenses relate to the operations of oil and gas properties in our Cinco Terry area located in the Permian Basin in West Texas. On February 28, 2011, we acquired a 38.33% working interest in Cinco Terry from two non-operating partners for $76 million, subject to usual and customary post-closing adjustments (the "Working Interest Acquisition").
     We were the operator of the properties prior to the Working Interest Acquisition. The accompanying statement of revenue and direct operating expenses was derived from the historical accounting records of Approach and reflects the acquired interest in the revenue and direct operating expenses of the Working Interest Acquisition. The statement does not include depreciation, depletion and amortization, general and administrative expenses, income taxes or interest expense, as these costs are not readily determinable. The statement is not indicative of the financial condition or results of operations of the Working Interest Acquisition Properties due to potential changes in the business and the omission of certain operating expenses as described above.
     Revenue is recognized when quantities of production are delivered to or collected by the respective purchaser. Title to the produced quantities transfers to the purchasers at the time the purchaser collects or receives the quantities. Prices for such production are defined in sales contracts and are readily determinable based on certain publicly available indices. All transportation costs are included as a reduction of oil, NGL and gas sales.
     For the year ended December 31, 2010, oil production was sold to one independent purchaser and NGL and natural gas production was sold to another independent purchaser.
     Direct operating expenses are recorded when the related liability is incurred. Direct operating expenses include lease operating expense, production taxes and exploration expense.
     The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding certain types of revenues and expenses. Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements. Accordingly, upon settlement, actual results may differ from estimated amounts.
     Historical financial statements reflecting financial position, results of operations and cash flows required by GAAP are not presented, as such information is not readily determinable and is not meaningful to the Working Interest Acquisition for the year ended December 31, 2010. Accordingly, the historical summaries of revenue and direct operating expenses are presented in lieu of the financial statements required under Rule 3-05 of the Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X.
2. Related Party Transactions
     The properties were operated by Approach during the year ended December 31, 2010, during which the properties were charged overhead of approximately $321,000. Overhead is included in direct operating expenses on the statement of revenue and direct operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010.
 
3. Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Reserves (Unaudited)
     All of the operations of the Working Interest Acquisition properties are directly related to our oil, NGL and gas producing activities located in the Permian Basin in West Texas. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically produciblefrom a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for any reservoir may change substantially over time due to results from operational activity. Estimates of proved reserve volumes at December 31, 2010, were based on the average of the closing price on the first day of each month for the 12-month period prior to December 31, 2010, for oil, natural gas and NGLs in accordance with the SEC's Final Rule, and ASC 932, Changes in commodity prices and operations costs may increase or decrease estimates of proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves.
Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting
Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities.
     Estimates of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and are continually subject to revision based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. A summary of changes in quantities of proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves related to the Working Interest Acquisition properties for the year ended December 31, 2010, is as follows:
     The following is a discussion of the material changes in our proved reserve quantities for the year ended December 31, 2010.
     
Year Ended December 31, 2010
     Our drilling programs in the Working Interest Acquisition properties resulted in our classification of reserves as proved, which accounts for the additional quantities listed under extensions and discoveries. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a 381 MBoe positive revision to our previous estimate, resulting from 141 MBoe attributable to an increase in commodity prices and 240 MBoe of positive performance revisions. The commodity prices used to estimate our proved reserves at December 31, 2010, increased to $4.38/MMBtu of gas, $39.25/Bbl of NGLs and $79.40/Bbl of oil from $3.87/MMBtu of natural gas, $27.20/Bbl of NGLs and $56.04/Bbl of oil at December 31, 2009.
 
Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Reserves
     The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and natural gas reserves and the changes in standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and natural gas reserves were prepared in accordance with provisions of ASC 932. Future cash inflows were computed by applying the average on the closing price on the first day of each month for the 12-month period prior to December 31, 2010, to estimated future production. Future production and development costs are computed by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved oil and natural gas reserves at year end, based on year-end costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions.
     Future income tax expenses are calculated by applying appropriate year-end tax rates to future pre-tax net cash flows relating to proved oil and natural gas reserves, less the tax basis of properties involved.
     Future income tax expenses give effect to permanent differences, tax credits and loss carryforwards relating to the proved oil and natural gas reserves. Future net cash flows are discounted at a rate of 10% annually to derive the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. This calculation procedure does not necessarily result in an estimate of the fair market value of Approach's oil and natural gas properties.
     The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and natural gas reserves from the Working Interest Acquisition Properties are as follows (in thousands):

Exhibit 99.2
Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Balance Sheet
     On February 28 2011, Approach Resources Inc. (together with our subsidiaries, "Approach," the "Company," "we," "us" or "our") acquired a 38.33% working interest in our Cinco Terry operating area from two non-operating partners for $76 million, subject to usual and customary post-closing adjustments (the "Working Interest Acquisition"). We were the operator of the properties prior to the Working Interest Acquisition.
     The following pro forma combined balance sheet presents our historical financial position combined with the Working Interest Acquisition as if the acquisition and the financing for the acquisition had occurred on December 31, 2010, and includes adjustments which give effect to events that are directly attributable to the transaction and that are factually supportable, regardless of whether they have a continuing impact or are nonrecurring.
     The pro forma combined balance sheet is not necessarily indicative of what our financial position actually would have been had we completed the acquisition at December 31, 2010. In addition, the pro forma combined balance sheet does not purport to project our future financial position.
     The pro forma combined balance sheet should be read in conjunction with the:
We prepared the pro forma combined balance sheet using the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, our estimated cost for the Working Interest Acquisition of $76 million ($70 million, after purchase price adjustments), has been allocated to these assets acquired and liabilities assumed according to their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.
 
 
1. Description of Transaction and Basis of Presentation
     On February 28, 2011, we acquired a 38.33% working interest in our Cinco Terry operating area from two non-operating partners for $76 million, subject to usual and customary post-closing adjustments. We were the operator of the properties prior to the Working Interest Acquisition.
     The asset purchase has been accounted for as a purchase under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The assets and liabilities of the Working Interest Acquisition are recorded at their respective fair values, and consolidated with our assets and liabilities upon completion of the acquisition. The results of operations of the Working Interest Acquisition will be consolidated with our existing operations beginning on March 1, 2011. Our financial statements issued after the completion of the acquisition will reflect these values, but will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of the Working Interest Acquisition.
2. Pro Forma Adjustments
     Adjustments included in the column under the heading "Pro Forma Adjustments" reflects the Working Interest Acquisition as if it occurred on December 31, 2010. The following is a summary of the purchase price paid and its allocation (in thousands):

     In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this current report on Form 8-K, including the attached exhibits, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as otherwise expressly stated in such filing.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
     Fort Worth, Texas, May 4, 2011  Approach Resources Inc. today reported financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2011. Highlights for first quarter 2011, compared to first quarter 2010, include:
(NASDAQ: AREX)
     Production for first quarter 2011 totaled 469 MBoe (5.2 MBoe/d), compared to 330 MBoe (3.7 MBoe/d) in first quarter 2010, a 42% increase. Oil and NGL production for first quarter 2011 increased 108% to 193 MBbls, compared to 93 MBbls produced in first quarter 2010. Compared to production for fourth quarter 2010, total production increased 8% and oil and NGL production increased 20%. Production for first quarter 2011 was 59% natural gas and 41% oil and NGLs, compared to 72% natural gas and 28% oil and NGLs in first quarter 2010. We expect oil and NGL production to continue to increase to approximately 55% of total production during 2011 due to continued development of the Wolffork oil shale resource play and processing gas in the southeast portion of Project Pangea, which began on April 1, 2011.
First Quarter 2011 Financial Results
     Net income for first quarter 2011 was $1.5 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, on revenues of $20.2 million. This compares to net income for first quarter 2010 of $3.6 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, on revenues of $13.2 million, which included a $5.1 million unrealized gain on commodity derivatives. The $7 million increase in revenues in the first quarter of 2011 is primarily attributable to an increase in oil and NGL production volumes ($7.6 million), partially offset by a decrease in natural gas prices ($600,000).
     First quarter 2011 net income included an unrealized loss on commodity derivatives of $149,000 and a gain on the sale of the Company's assets in British Columbia of $488,000. Our carrying value related to our assets in British Columbia previously was written off as an impairment of unproved properties at year end 2009. Excluding these items and related income taxes, adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for first quarter 2011 was $1.2 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $200,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, for first quarter 2010. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income.
 
     Net income and adjusted net income were impacted by $4.6 million of exploration expense, of which $3.2 million was related to lease extensions in our core operating area in the Permian Basin that we elected to pay in the first quarter of 2011 ahead of the University of Texas Lease Sale in March 2011. The after-tax impact of the $3.2 million in exploration expense for these lease extensions was $2.1 million, or $0.07 per diluted share.
     EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for first quarter 2011 was $14 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, compared to $9 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for first quarter 2010. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of EBITDAX to net income.
     Average realized prices for first quarter 2011, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $4.30 per Mcf of natural gas, $90.67 per Bbl of oil and $48.04 per Bbl of NGLs, compared to $5.39 per Mcf of natural gas, $75.42 per Bbl of oil and $43.33 per Bbl of NGLs, for first quarter 2010. Our average realized price, including the effect of commodity derivatives, was $43.03 per Boe for first quarter 2011, compared to $40.02 per Boe for first quarter 2010.
     Lease operating expense ("LOE") for first quarter 2011 was $2.6 million, or $5.64 per Boe, compared to $1.8 million, or $5.58 per Boe, in first quarter 2010. The increase in total LOE was primarily attributable to an increase in working interest in our core operating area in the Permian Basin, Project Pangea. During the first quarter of 2011, we acquired the remaining 38% working interest in the northwest area of Project Pangea (the "Working Interest Acquisition"), which increased our working interest to approximately 100%. We also experienced an increase in repair and maintenance expenses partially due to inclement winter weather in southwest Texas. Higher production volumes in first quarter 2011, however, resulted in consistent LOE per Boe, compared to first quarter 2010, and a slight decrease in LOE per Boe compared to fourth quarter 2010.
     Severance and production taxes for first quarter 2011 were $1.1 million, or $2.35 per Boe, compared to $694,000, or $2.10 per Boe, in first quarter 2010. Severance and production taxes were approximately 5.5% and 5.2% of oil, NGL and gas sales for first quarter 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in severance and production taxes was primarily due to the increase in oil, NGL and gas sales over first quarter 2010.
     Exploration expense for first quarter 2011 was $4.6 million, or $9.87 per Boe, compared to $1.5 million, or $4.52 per Boe, in first quarter 2010. Higher exploration expense for first quarter 2011 was primarily the result of the timing of lease extensions and expirations in Project Pangea. During first quarter 2011, we extended leases for an additional four years for approximately 9,200 acres in the northwest area of Project Pangea for $3.2 million, or approximately $350 per acre. As discussed above, we elected to pay the $3.2 million in first quarter 2011, ahead of the University of Texas Lease Sale that took place on March 30, 2011. The after-tax impact of the early lease extensions was $2.1 million, or $0.07 per diluted share. In addition, approximately 5,000 acres in the southeast area of Project Pangea expired during the first quarter of 2011, resulting in approximately $1.2 million of exploration expense. We expect to renew this acreage during second quarter 2011.
     General and administrative expense ("G&A") for first quarter 2011 was $3.5 million, or $7.46 per Boe, compared to $2.5 million, or $7.60 per Boe, for first quarter 2010. The increase in G&A was principally due to higher salaries and benefits, share-based compensation, professional fees and data processing.
 
     Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense ("DD&A") for first quarter 2011 was $6.1 million, or $12.90 per Boe, compared to $5.8 million, or $17.68 per Boe, for first quarter 2010. The decrease in DD&A per Boe was primarily attributable to an increase in estimated proved developed reserves, partially offset by an increase in production and capitalized costs over first quarter 2010.
     Capital expenditures during first quarter 2011 totaled $113.6 million, which included $26.8 million for exploration and development drilling, $70.2 million for the Working Interest Acquisition and $16.6 million for new acreage acquisitions. During first quarter 2011, we acquired approximately 17,600 net acres in Crockett and Schleicher Counties, Texas. Average cost for our total net acreage position in the Permian Basin is approximately $300 per acre, and we have a 100% working interest in substantially all of our acreage with an average net revenue interest of 76%.
Operations Update
     During the first quarter of 2011, we drilled a total of 17 gross (13.2 net) wells and completed 16 gross (10.7 net) wells, including five gross (3.5 net) wells that were waiting on completion at year end 2010. At March 31, 2011, six gross (six net) wells were waiting on completion. We currently have three rigs running in the Permian Basin, including one horizontal rig and two vertical rigs. During 2011, we plan to drill 11 horizontal wells targeting the Wolfcamp Shale, 19 vertical wells targeting the Wolffork and Canyon Sands and 26 vertical wells targeting the Canyon Sands, which we expect to complete in the Wolffork zones in 2012.
Horizontal Wolfcamp Pilot Program
     We recently completed our first horizontal pilot well targeting the Wolfcamp Shale. The Cinco Terry M 901H well flowed at a max rate of 171 Boe per day, consisting of 51 Bbls of oil, 61 Bbls of NGLs and 355 Mcf of gas (after shrink for NGL processing), from a 5,377-foot lateral, completed with a total of 15 stages. The well had a stabilized production rate of 166 Boe per day, consisting of 52 Bbls of oil, 58 Bbls of NGLs and 337 Mcf of gas (after shrink for NGL processing). The stabilized production rate represents the five-day average daily production after the well recovered approximately 35% of fracture stimulation fluids.
     We also recently completed the University 42 21 1H well with 21 stages. The University 42 21 1H, a 7,037-foot lateral, currently is flowing back fracture stimulation fluids. In addition, we recently finished drilling the Cinco Terry G 701H well. The Cinco Terry G 701H was drilled to a total lateral length of 7,609 feet. We expect to complete the well with approximately 24 stages during the second quarter of 2011. We have begun drilling our fourth horizontal well, the University 45 7 1H well. We expect to drill the well to a total lateral length of approximately 7,200 feet and complete the well with approximately 22 stages, also during the second quarter of 2011.
     We are in the early stage of our pilot program testing the Wolfcamp Shale with horizontal wells. We are encouraged by our initial results in the play, and we continue to increase our acreage position in the Permian Basin, which now totals approximately 134,500 net acres. We also continue to evaluate and refine our drilling and completion techniques, lateral length and completion stages in an effort to improve costs, production and ultimate recovery rates.
 
Financial Update
Credit Agreement and Liquidity
     At March 31, 2011, we had a $200 million revolving credit agreement with a $150 million borrowing base and $76.7 million outstanding. Our liquidity at March 31, 2011, was $74.2 million.
     On May 4, 2011, we entered into a tenth amendment to our credit agreement, which increases the borrowing base by $50 million to $200 million, based on our year-end 2010 proved reserves. The amendment to our credit agreement also raises the maximum total commitment to $300 million, lowers the applicable interest rate by 0.50%, extends the maturity date by two years to July 2014, raises the debt to EBITDAX ratio covenant to not more than 4 to 1, permits the issuance of up to $200 million in senior unsecured debt and adds a fifth bank, Royal Bank of Canada, to the lending group. Under the amended credit agreement, the issuance of senior unsecured debt would cause a reduction in borrowing base of 25% of the principal amount of such debt.
     Including the borrowing base increase, our liquidity was $124.2 million at March 31, 2011. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our calculation of "liquidity."
     We believe we have adequate liquidity from cash generated from operations and unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility for current working capital needs and maintenance of our current drilling program. However, we may determine to access the public or private equity or debt markets for future development of reserves, acquisitions, expansion of our current drilling program, additional working capital or other liquidity needs, if such financing is available on acceptable terms. We cannot guarantee that financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures
     This release contains certain financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. We have provided reconciliations below of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and on the Non-GAAP Financial Information page in the Investor Relations section of our website at .
www.approachresources.com
Adjusted Net Income
     This release contains the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, which exclude the following items:
     The amounts included in the calculation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share below were computed in accordance with GAAP. We believe adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are useful to investors because they provide readers with a more meaningful measure of our profitability before recording certain items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably determined. However, these measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
 
     The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively (in thousands, except per-share amounts):
EBITDAX
     We define EBITDAX as net income, plus (1) exploration expense, (2) depletion, depreciation and amortization expense, (3) share-based compensation expense, (4) unrealized loss (gain) on commodity derivatives, (5) gain on sale of oil and gas properties, (6) interest expense and (7) income taxes. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flow as determined by GAAP. The amounts included in the calculation of EBITDAX were computed in accordance with GAAP. EBITDAX is presented herein and reconciled to the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund development and exploration activities. This measure is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
     The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDAX to net income for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively (in thousands, except per-share amounts):
 
Liquidity
     Liquidity is calculated by adding the net funds available under our revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents. We use liquidity as an indicator of the Company's ability to fund development and exploration activities. However, this measurement has limitations. This measurement can vary from year to year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the measurement on a company's financial statements. This measurement is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
     The table below summarizes our liquidity position at March 31, 2011, and our liquidity position at March 31, 2011, reflecting the May 2011 borrowing base increase to $200 million from $150 million (dollars in thousands).

Exhibit 99.1
August 2, 2011
For Immediate Release
     Fort Worth, Texas, August 2, 2011  Approach Resources Inc. today reported financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2011. Highlights for second quarter 2011, compared to second quarter 2010, include:
(NASDAQ: AREX)
Approach also provided an update on proved reserves and operations. Highlights include:
     Production for second quarter 2011 totaled 608 MBoe (6.7 MBoe/d), compared to 372 MBoe (4.1 MBoe/d) in second quarter 2010, a 63% increase over the prior year period. Oil and NGL production for second quarter 2011 increased 203% to 340 MBbls, compared to 112 MBbls produced in second quarter 2010. Compared to first quarter 2011, total production increased 30% and oil and NGL production increased 76%. Production for second quarter 2011 was 56% oil and NGLs and 44% natural gas, compared to 30% oil and NGLs and 70% natural gas in second quarter 2010. Oil and NGL production increased during second quarter 2011 due to continued development of the Wolffork oil shale resource play, the acquisition of additional working interest in northwest Project Pangea in first quarter 2011 and processing gas in the southeast portion of Project Pangea, which began on April 1, 2011.
Management Comment
     J. Ross Craft, Approach President and CEO, commented "Oil and NGLs dominated our production mix in second quarter 2011 for the first time in Company history. The benefit of this shift is reflected in our increase in revenues, EBITDAX and net income. We also continued to make progress with our horizontal Wolfcamp pilot program, and I am encouraged by the results from our third and forth
 
horizontal Wolfcamp wells. With our strong performance in the first half of 2011, I believe we are well positioned to continue delivering growth in the second half of the year and beyond."
Second Quarter 2011 Financial Results
     Net income for second quarter 2011 was $8 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, on revenues of $29.1 million. This compares to net income for second quarter 2010 of $1.6 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, on revenues of $13.2 million, which included a $1.9 million unrealized loss on commodity derivatives. The $16 million increase in revenues in the second quarter of 2011 was attributable to an increase in oil and NGL production volumes ($14.4 million) and an increase in oil and NGL prices ($1.6 million).
     Second quarter 2011 net income included an unrealized gain on commodity derivatives of $2.2 million. Excluding the unrealized gain on commodity derivatives and related income taxes, adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for second quarter 2011 was $6.5 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to $2.8 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for second quarter 2010. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income.
     EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for second quarter 2011 was $21 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, compared to $10.3 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for second quarter 2010. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of EBITDAX to net income.
     Average realized prices for second quarter 2011, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $97.89 per Bbl of oil, $51.88 per Bbl of NGLs and $4.16 per Mcf of natural gas, compared to $73.26 per Bbl of oil, $40.33 per Bbl of NGLs and $4.41 per Mcf of natural gas, for second quarter 2010. Our average realized price, including the effect of commodity derivatives, was $48.01 per Boe for second quarter 2011, compared to $40.11 per Boe for second quarter 2010.
     Lease operating expense ("LOE") for second quarter 2011 was $3.6 million, or $5.93 per Boe, compared to $2.2 million, or $5.93 per Boe, in second quarter 2010. The increase in total LOE was primarily attributable to the increase in working interest in northwest Project Pangea. In February 2011, we acquired the remaining 38% working interest in northwest Project Pangea, which increased our working interest to approximately 100%. We also experienced an increase in repair and maintenance expenses as well as increased service costs.
     Severance and production taxes for second quarter 2011 were $1.7 million, or $2.80 per Boe, compared to $610,000, or $1.64 per Boe, in second quarter 2010. Severance and production taxes were approximately 5.8% and 4.6% of oil, NGL and gas sales for second quarter 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in severance and production taxes was primarily due to the increase in oil, NGL and gas sales over second quarter 2010.
     Exploration expense for second quarter 2011 was $280,000, or $0.46 per Boe, compared to $187,000, or $0.50 per Boe, in second quarter 2010. We expect exploration expense to be $4.00 per Boe  $5.00 per Boe through the remainder of 2011.
     General and administrative expense ("G&A") for second quarter 2011 was $4.6 million, or $7.55 per Boe, compared to $2.2 million, or $5.87 per Boe, for second quarter 2010. The increase in G&A was primarily due to higher share-based compensation, salaries and benefits and professional fees.
 
     Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense ("DD&A") for second quarter 2011 was $8 million, or $13.14 per Boe, compared to $5 million, or $13.47 per Boe, for second quarter 2010. The decrease in DD&A per Boe was primarily attributable to an increase in estimated proved developed reserves, partially offset by an increase in production and capitalized costs over second quarter 2010.
Operations Update
     During the second quarter of 2011, we drilled a total of 15 wells, completed 16 wells and recompleted three wells. During the six months ended June 30, 2011, we drilled 32 gross (28.2 net) wells, completed 32 gross (26.7 net) wells and recompleted four gross (four net) wells. At June 30, 2011, we had five wells waiting on completion. Exploration and development drilling expenditures totaled $44.8 million for the second quarter of 2011, and $77 million for the first half of 2011.
     Approach currently has two vertical rigs and one horizontal rig running in the Southern Midland Basin. The Company has entered into an 18-month contract for a dedicated, third-party fracture stimulation fleet. Approach will have a 24-hour crew for a minimum of ten days per month.
Horizontal Wolfcamp Oil Shale Program
     During the second quarter of 2011, we completed two horizontal wells targeting the Wolfcamp oil shale. Our fourth horizontal pilot well, the University 45 A 701H, a 6,859-foot lateral, was completed with a 21-stage fracture stimulation. The University 45 A 701H flowed at an initial 24-hour rate of 693 Boe/d, consisting of 613 Bbls of oil ("BO"), 41 Bbls of NGLs and 237 Mcf of gas.
     Our third horizontal well, the Cinco Terry G 701H, a 7,609-foot lateral, was completed with a 23-stage fracture stimulation. The Cinco Terry G 701H flowed at an initial 24-hour rate of 328 Boe/d, consisting of 168 BO, 81 Bbls of NGLs and 473 Mcf of gas.
     We plan to complete our fifth and sixth horizontal wells targeting the Wolfcamp oil shale in mid-August 2011. The University 45 D 901H and University 45 D 902H were drilled to a total lateral length of 7,614 feet and 7,770 feet, respectively. Our seventh horizontal well, the University 45 C 803H, a 7,358-foot lateral, is waiting on completion, and we currently are drilling the University 45 B 240 1H, our eighth horizontal well.
Proved Reserves Update
     Mid-year 2011 estimated proved reserves totaled 66.8 MMBoe, an increase of 32% compared to year-end 2010 proved reserves of 50.7 MMBoe. Approach's mid-year 2011 proved reserves are 55% oil and NGLs, 45% natural gas and 50% proved developed. At June 30, 2011, 97% of our proved reserves were located in our core operating area in the Permian Basin. Mid-year 2011 proved reserves included 8.4 MMBoe attributable to our emerging Wolffork oil shale resource play.
 
     The following table is a reconciliation of the changes in our proved reserves between December 31, 2010, and June 30, 2011.
     The standardized after-tax measure of discounted future net cash flows (the "Standardized Measure") for our proved reserves at June 30, 2011, was $328.7 million. The pre-tax present value of our proved reserves discounted at 10% ("PV-10"), was estimated at $521.2 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2011, we engaged DeGolyer and MacNaughton, independent, third-party reserves engineers, to prepare independent estimates of our proved reserves. Estimates of the PV-10 of our proved reserves were prepared by the Company's internal reservoir engineers. Proved reserves volumes and PV-10 were prepared using $85.92 per Bbl of oil, $44.96 per Bbl of NGLs and $3.98 per Mcf of natural gas, and. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures" below for our definition of PV-10 and a reconciliation to the Standardized Measure.
Finding and Development Costs
     Preliminary, unaudited estimates of costs incurred during the first six months of 2011 totaled $162.7 million, and included $77 million for exploration and development drilling, $70.2 million for the purchase of additional working interest in the northwest area of Project Pangea and $15.5 million for acreage acquisitions. Based on total costs incurred at June 30, 2011, of $162.7 million and net proved reserve additions of 17.2 MMBoe, all-in finding and development ("F&D") costs were $9.45 per Boe. Based on exploration and development costs incurred at June 30, 2011, of $77 million and proved reserve extensions and discoveries of 8.9 MMBoe, drill-bit F&D costs were $8.64 per Boe. F&D cost is a non-GAAP measure. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures" below for our definition of F&D costs and reconciliation to the information required by ASC 932-235.

     At June 30, 2011, we had a $300 million revolving credit agreement with a $200 million borrowing base and $93.6 million outstanding. Our liquidity at June 30, 2011, was $106.9 million. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our calculation of "liquidity."
     We believe we have adequate liquidity from cash generated from operations and unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility for current working capital needs and maintenance of our current drilling program. However, we may determine to access the public or private equity or debt markets for future development of reserves, acquisitions, expansion of our current drilling program, additional working capital or other liquidity needs, if such financing is available on acceptable terms. We cannot guarantee that financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all.
 
Commodity Derivatives Positions
     The following table sets forth our commodity derivative volumes and prices as of June 30, 2011.
2011 Capital Program and Guidance
     Total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $220 million, with approximately $130 million allocated to drilling and recompletion projects in the Permian Basin and approximately $90 million allocated to the acquisition of the remaining 38% working interest in northwest Project Pangea, lease extensions, renewals and acquisitions in the Permian Basin and the acquisition of 3-D seismic in the Permian Basin.
     Our 2011 capital budget is subject to change depending upon a number of factors, including additional data on our Wolffork oil shale resource play, results of Wolfcamp Shale and Wolffork drilling and recompletions, economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil, NGLs and gas, the availability of sufficient capital resources for drilling prospects, our financial results and the availability of lease extensions and renewals on reasonable terms.
     The Company is targeting approximately 50% production growth in 2011, based on the midpoint of current 2011 production guidance, or 2,375 MBoe. The table below sets forth the Company's current 2011 production and operating costs and expenses guidance. The guidance is forward-looking information that is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures
     This release contains certain financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. We have provided reconciliations below of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and on the Non-GAAP Financial Information page in the Investor Relations section of our website at .
www.approachresources.com
Adjusted Net Income
     This release contains the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, which exclude the following items:
     The amounts included in the calculation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share below were computed in accordance with GAAP. We believe adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are useful to investors because they provide readers with a more meaningful measure of our profitability before recording certain items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably determined. However, these measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
 
     The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively (in thousands, except per-share amounts).
EBITDAX
     We define EBITDAX as net income, plus (1) exploration expense, (2) depletion, depreciation and amortization expense, (3) share-based compensation expense, (4) unrealized (gain) loss on commodity derivatives, (5) gain on sale of oil and gas properties, (6) interest expense and (7) income taxes. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flow as determined by GAAP. The amounts included in the calculation of EBITDAX were computed in accordance with GAAP. EBITDAX is presented herein and reconciled to the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund development and exploration activities. This measure is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
     The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDAX to net income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively (in thousands, except per-share amounts).
 
PV-10
     The present value of our proved reserves, discounted at 10% ("PV-10"), was estimated at $521.2 million at June 30, 2011, and was calculated based on the first-of-the-month, twelve-month average prices of $85.92 per Bbl of oil, $44.96 per Bbl of NGLs and $3.98 per Mcf of natural gas,.
     PV-10 is our estimate of the present value of future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves after deducting estimated production and ad valorem taxes, future capital costs and operating expenses, but before deducting any estimates of future income taxes. The estimated future net revenues are discounted at an annual rate of 10% to determine their "present value." We believe PV-10 to be an important measure for evaluating the relative significance of our oil and gas properties and that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure of PV-10 provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and investors in evaluating oil and gas companies. Because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid, we believe the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable for evaluating the Company. We believe that PV-10 is a financial measure routinely used and calculated similarly by other companies in the oil and gas industry.
     The following table reconciles PV-10 to the Standardized Measure, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. PV-10 should not be considered as an alternative to the Standardized Measure as computed under GAAP.
Finding and Development Costs
     are calculated by dividing the sum of property acquisition costs, exploration costs and development costs for the year by the sum of reserve extensions and discoveries, purchases of minerals in place and total revisions for the year.
All-in finding and development ("F&D") costs
     are calculated by dividing the sum of exploration costs and development costs for the year by the total of reserve extensions and discoveries for the year.
Drill-bit F&D costs
     We believe that providing the above measures of F&D cost is useful to assist in an evaluation of how much it costs the Company, on a per Boe basis, to add proved reserves. However, these measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our previous SEC filings and to be included in our annual report on Form 10-K to be filed with the SEC on or before March 15, 2012. Due to various factors, including timing differences, F&D costs do not necessarily reflect precisely the costs associated with particular reserves. For example, exploration costs may be recorded in periods before the periods in which related increases in reserves are
 
recorded, and development costs may be recorded in periods after the periods in which related increases in reserves are recorded. In addition, changes in commodity prices can affect the magnitude of recorded increases (or decreases) in reserves independent of the related costs of such increases.
     As a result of the above factors and various factors that could materially affect the timing and amounts of future increases in reserves and the timing and amounts of future costs, including factors disclosed in our filings with the SEC, we cannot assure you that the Company's future F&D costs will not differ materially from those set forth above. Further, the methods used by us to calculate F&D costs may differ significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, our F&D costs may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.
     The following table reconciles our estimated F&D costs for the first six months of 2011 to the information required by paragraphs 11 and 21 of ASC 932-235.
 
Liquidity
     Liquidity is calculated by adding the net funds available under our revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents. We use liquidity as an indicator of the Company's ability to fund development and exploration activities. However, this measurement has limitations. This measurement can vary from year to year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the measurement on a company's financial statements. This measurement is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
     The table below summarizes our liquidity position at June 30, 2011 (dollars in thousands).

Exhibit 10.1
[Execution Version]
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 2200 Ross Avenue, Third Floor Dallas, Texas 75201 Attention: Kimberly A. Bourgeois
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     Reference is hereby made to that certain Credit Agreement dated as of January 18, 2008 among Approach Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Borrower"), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Agent ("Agent"), and the Lenders that are signatory parties hereto (the "Lenders"), as amended by amendments dated February 19, 2008, May 6, 2008, August 26, 2008, April 8, 2009, July 8, 2009, October 30, 2009, February 1, 2010, May 3, 2010, October 21, 2010, May 4, 2011 and as of the date hereof (as amended, the "Loan Agreement"). All capitalized terms herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Loan Agreement.
     Pursuant to this Eleventh Amendment (the "Amendment"), Agent, Lenders and Borrower agree, effective as of the date hereof, to amend the Loan Agreement according to the terms and provisions set forth below.
     1. . Section 1 of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended to redefine "Loan Documents" as follows:
Definition of Loan Documents
     "Loan Documents means this Agreement, the Notes, the Collateral Documents and all other documents executed by Borrower with Agent or Lenders in connection with the transaction described in this Agreement, including any and all amendments to this Agreement made pursuant to Section 24 of this Agreement."
     2. . Section 6(b) of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended by deleting the last sentence thereof and substituting the following therefor:
Collateral Security
     "From time to time, Borrower will cause to be executed and delivered to Agent additional Collateral Documents if Agent reasonably deems such are necessary to insure perfection or maintenance of Lenders' security interests and Liens in not less than 80% of the Engineered Value of the Oil and Gas Properties which are included in the Borrowing Base then in effect."
     3. . The following is hereby added to the end of Section 14 of the Loan Agreement, "Events of Default":
Events of Default
 
     "After the exercise of remedies provided for in this Agreement, the Collateral Documents or any of the other Loan Documents (or after the Loans have automatically become immediately due and payable as set forth in this Section 14), any amounts received on account of the Notes or any Loans shall be applied by Agent in the following order:
First, to payment of that portion of the amounts owed hereunder and under the other Loan Documents constituting fees, indemnities, expenses and other amounts (including fees, charges and disbursements of counsel to Agent) payable to Agent in its capacity as such;
Second, to payment of that portion of the amounts owed hereunder constituting fees, indemnities and other amounts (other than principal, interest and Letter of Credit fees) payable to Lenders (including fees, charges and disbursements of counsel to the respective Lenders), ratably among them in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Second payable to Agent and Lenders;
Third, to payment of that portion of the amounts due hereunder constituting accrued and unpaid Letters of Credit Fees and interest on the Loans, ratably among Lenders, in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Third payable to them;
Fourth, to payment of that portion of the amounts owed hereunder constituting unpaid principal of the Loans, unpaid Reimbursement Obligations, the maximum amounts which Lenders might then or thereafter be called upon to advance under all Letters of Credit then outstanding and settlements under Rate Management Transactions ratably among Lenders in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Fourth held by them; and
Last, the balance, if any, after all of the amounts due hereunder, under the Loans and under the other Loan Documents have been indefeasibly paid in full, to Borrower, or as otherwise required by applicable law.
If an amount of an undrawn Letter of Credit or other contingent amount is included in the foregoing and such Letter of Credit or other contingent amount expires and the resulting obligations are lower than the amount that was included in the forgoing application of payments, the Agent shall revise the calculation under the forgoing application of payments, and the Lenders and other parties receiving such payments shall be obligated to refund any excess payment to the Agent to be applied in accordance with the revised calculation of the application of payments."
     4. . Section 15(c) of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended by deleting "FROST" from line 5 thereof and inserting "JPMORGAN" in its place.
Agent and Lenders; Consultation with Counsel
     5. . As of the date hereof, the Borrowing Base and Commitment under the Loan Agreement are increased to $260,000,000.
Increase to Borrowing Base and Commitment
 
     6. . Prior to giving effect to this Amendment, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., BNP Paribas, KeyBank National Association, The Frost National Bank and Royal Bank of Canada (the "Existing Lenders") each has a Commitment Percentage as set out below under the heading "Existing Lender Commitments." The Existing Lenders desire to assign to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the "New Lender"), a percentage of each Existing Lender's Commitment Percentage of its obligations as a Lender under the Loan Agreement, such that after giving effect to such assignments and as of the date hereof, the respective Commitment Percentages of the Existing Lenders and the New Lender will be as set forth below under the heading "Revised Lender Commitments" and on Schedule I attached hereto and made a part hereof and of the Loan Agreement, as amended hereby. Agent and Borrower hereby consent to the assignments by Existing Lenders of such portion of each of their rights and obligations as a Lender under the Loan Agreement to the New Lender. Effective as of the date hereof such acquisition of a portion of the Existing Lenders' Commitments by the New Lender shall be deemed to have been consummated pursuant to the terms of the Assignment and Acceptance Agreement attached as Exhibit D to the Loan Agreement (which is incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth herein) as if the Existing Lenders and the New Lender had executed Assignment and Acceptance Agreements with respect to such assignments.
Assignments of Commitment
     7. . Effective as of the date hereof, Schedule I to the Loan Agreement is deleted in its entirety and Schedule I attached hereto is substituted therefor.
Schedule I
     8. . As of the date hereof there shall be executed and delivered by Borrower to each of the Existing Lenders and the New Lenders, if requested, replacement Notes, in the form of Exhibit "B" attached hereto reflecting the percentage of each Lender's Pro Rata Part of the Facility Amount. Promptly upon receipt of a replacement Note, each Lender shall deliver to Borrower all existing Notes held by each such Lender.
Replacement Notes
     9. . Notwithstanding Sections 3(a) and 3(b) of the Loan Agreement referencing that the Loans shall be evidenced by Notes payable to each Lender in the aggregate face amount of the Facility Amount, the delivery of such a Note to the Lenders shall be at each Lender's discretion. Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a Note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to the
Notes
 
order of such Lender in the form of Exhibit "B" to the Loan Agreement. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 29 of the Loan Agreement) be represented by one or more Notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein. Irrespective of the Facility Amount, no Lender shall ever be obligated to advance on the Commitment any amount in excess of its Commitment then in effect.
     10. . The effectiveness of this Amendment is subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions precedent, unless specifically waived in writing by Lenders:
Conditions Precedent
     (a) . Borrower, each Guarantor and each Lender shall have duly and validly executed and delivered this Amendment to Agent.

     13. . Except as affected by the provisions set forth herein, the Loan Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and is hereby ratified and confirmed by all parties. The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Amendment shall not, except as expressly provided herein, operate as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of Lenders under the Loan Agreement or the other Loan Documents.
Confirmation and Ratification

Reference to Loan Agreement
     15. . This Amendment may be executed in a number of identical separate counterparts, each of which for all purposes is to be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute, collectively, one agreement. No party to this Amendment shall be bound hereby until a counterpart of this Amendment has been executed by all parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Amendment by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Amendment.
Multiple Counterparts
     16. THIS AMENDMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS.
Governing Law
.
     17. . THE LOAN AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED BY THIS AMENDMENT, AND ALL PROMISSORY NOTES AND OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS EXECUTED PURSUANT THERETO OR HERETO, REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES.

("Agent") in Dallas County, Texas, the principal sum of _______ MILLION AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($_________________), or so much thereof as may be advanced by Lender and outstanding at any time or from time to time pursuant to the Credit Agreement (as hereinafter defined) in lawful money of the United States of America together with interest from the date hereof until paid at the rates specified in the Credit Agreement. All payments of principal and interest due hereunder are payable at the offices of Agent at 2200 Ross Avenue, Third Floor, Dallas, Texas 75201, Attention: Kimberly A. Bourgeois, or at such other address as Agent shall designate in writing to Borrower.
     The principal and all accrued interest on this Note shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Credit Agreement.
     This Note is executed pursuant to that certain Credit Agreement dated January 18, 2008 by and among Borrower, Agent and the other Lenders parties thereto, as amended (as amended, the "Credit Agreement") and is one of the Notes referred to therein. Reference is made to the Credit Agreement and the Loan Documents (as that term is defined in the Credit Agreement) for a statement of prepayment rights and obligations of Borrower, for a statement of the terms and conditions under which the due date of this Note may be accelerated and for statements regarding other matters affecting this Note (including without limitation the obligations of the holder hereof to advance funds hereunder, principal and interest payment due dates, voluntary and mandatory prepayments, exercise of rights and remedies, payment of attorneys' fees, court costs and other costs of collection and certain waivers by Borrower and others now or hereafter obligated for payment of any sums due hereunder). Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as that term is defined in the Credit Agreement and Loan Documents) Agent may declare forthwith to be entirely and immediately due and payable the principal balance hereof and the interest accrued hereon, and Lender shall have all rights and remedies of a Lender under the Credit Agreement and Loan Documents. This Note may be prepaid in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Credit Agreement.
     Regardless of any provision contained in this Note, the holder hereof shall never be entitled to receive, collect or apply, as interest on this Note, any amount in excess of the Maximum Rate (as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement), and, if the holder hereof ever receives, collects, or applies as interest any such amount which would be excessive interest, it shall be deemed a partial prepayment of principal and treated hereunder as such; and, if the indebtedness evidenced hereby is paid in full, any remaining excess shall forthwith be paid to Borrower. In determining whether or not the interest paid or payable under any specific
 
contingency exceeds the Maximum Rate, Borrower and the holder hereof shall, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law (i) characterize any non-principal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than as interest, (ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (iii) spread the total amount of interest throughout the entire contemplated term of the obligations evidenced by this Note and/or referred to in the Credit Agreement so that the interest rate is uniform throughout the entire term of this Note; provided that, if this Note is paid and performed in full prior to the end of the full contemplated term thereof and if the interest received for the actual period of existence thereof exceeds the Maximum Rate, the holder hereof shall refund to Borrower the amount of such excess or credit the amount of such excess against the indebtedness evidenced hereby, and, in such event, the holder hereof shall not be subject to any penalties provided by any laws for contracting for, charging, taking, reserving or receiving interest in excess of the Maximum Rate.
     If any payment of principal or interest on this Note shall become due on a day other than a Business Day (as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement), such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall in such case be included in computing interest in connection with such payment.
     If this Note is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection, or if it is collected through any legal proceeding at law or in equity or in bankruptcy, receivership or other court proceedings, Borrower agrees to pay all costs of collection, including, but not limited to, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees.
     Borrower and each surety, endorser, guarantor and other party ever liable for payment of any sums of money payable on this Note, jointly and severally waive presentment and demand for payment, notice of intention to accelerate the maturity, protest, notice of protest and nonpayment, as to this Note and as to each and all installments hereof, and agree that their liability under this Note shall not be affected by any renewal or extension in the time of payment hereof, or in any indulgences, or by any release or change in any security for the payment of this Note, and hereby consent to any and all renewals, extensions, indulgences, releases or changes.
     This Note renews and replaces, but does not extinguish, the amounts remaining unpaid on that certain promissory note dated May 4, 2011, executed by Borrower and payable to the order of Lender. [This paragraph does not apply to the Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Note.]
     THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS. BORROWER AGREES THAT THIS NOTE IS PERFORMABLE IN TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS AND THAT SUCH COUNTY IS PROPER VENUE FOR ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING INVOLVING THIS NOTE TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER VENUES.

Exhibit 99.1
For Immediate Release November 2, 2011
      Approach Resources Inc. today reported its third quarter 2011 results. Highlights for third quarter 2011, compared to third quarter 2010, include:
Fort Worth, Texas, November 2, 2011
(NASDAQ: AREX)
     Production for third quarter 2011 totaled 612 MBoe (6.7 MBoe/d), compared to 418 MBoe (4.5 MBoe/d) in third quarter 2010, a 46% increase over the prior year period. Oil and NGL production for third quarter 2011 increased 148% to 350 MBbls, compared to 141 MBbls produced in third quarter 2010. Production for third quarter 2011 was 57% oil and NGLs and 43% natural gas, compared to 34% oil and NGLs and 66% natural gas in third quarter 2010. Oil and NGL production increased during third quarter 2011 compared to third quarter 2010 due to continued development of the Wolffork oil shale resource play, the acquisition of additional working interest in northern Project Pangea in first quarter 2011 and processing gas in southern Project Pangea beginning in second quarter 2011.
     Production for third quarter 2011 was affected by a shortage of oil trucks due to increased industry activity in the Permian Basin. While production in Project Pangea is running as planned, we experienced an oil inventory build of approximately 29,000 barrels through third quarter 2011. We estimate that the inventory build reduced our potential sales volumes by approximately 315 Bbls/d during third quarter 2011. In response to tightness in the Permian oil trucking market, we have ordered four new oil hauling trucks, which we expect to be delivered by year end 2011. In addition, the Company is exploring long-term trucking, pipeline and rail alternatives.
     J. Ross Craft, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We continue to be pleased with results from our Wolffork oil shale resource play. Although we encountered oil takeaway constraints during the quarter, our field production is in line with our expectations. Solid well performance, reserve growth and a strong balance sheet provide the foundation for our 2012 capital program of $160 million. Our 2012 capital program allows us flexibility to grow production by more than 20% while being mindful of volatile commodity markets. With our extensive inventory of low-risk locations, I believe we're well positioned to capitalize on our Wolffork resource potential for many years to come."
 
Third Quarter 2011 Financial Results
     Net income for third quarter 2011 was $7.1 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, on revenues of $28 million. This compares to net income for third quarter 2010 of $2.1 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, on revenues of $14.9 million. The $13.1 million increase in revenues in the third quarter of 2011 was attributable to an increase in oil and NGL production volumes ($11.9 million) and an increase in oil and NGL prices ($1.2 million).
     Third quarter 2011 net income included an unrealized gain on commodity derivatives of $1.7 million, and third quarter 2010 net income included a $312,000 unrealized loss on commodity derivatives. Excluding the unrealized gain on commodity derivatives and related income taxes, adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for third quarter 2011 was $5.9 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared to $2.3 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for third quarter 2010. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income.
     EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for third quarter 2011 was $21.7 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, compared to $11.6 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, for third quarter 2010. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of EBITDAX to net income.
     Average realized prices for third quarter 2011, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $81.51 per Bbl of oil, $52.08 per Bbl of NGLs and $3.99 per Mcf of natural gas, compared to $72.19 per Bbl of oil, $36.65 per Bbl of NGLs and $4.34 per Mcf of natural gas, for third quarter 2010. Our average realized price, including the effect of commodity derivatives, was $47.98 per Boe for third quarter 2011, compared to $39.54 per Boe for third quarter 2010.
     Lease operating expense ("LOE") for third quarter 2011 was $3.6 million, or $5.82 per Boe, compared to $2 million, or $4.77 per Boe, in third quarter 2010. The increase in LOE compared to third quarter 2010 was principally due to the increase in our working interest in northern Project Pangea. In February 2011, we acquired the remaining 38% working interest in northern Project Pangea, which increased our working interest to approximately 100%. We also experienced an increase in water hauling, insurance and repair and maintenance expenses as well as generally higher service costs.
     Severance and production taxes for third quarter 2011 were $1.4 million, or $2.32 per Boe, compared to $743,000, or $1.78 per Boe, in third quarter 2010. Severance and production taxes were approximately 5.1% and 5.0% of oil, NGL and gas sales for third quarter 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in severance and production taxes from third quarter 2010 was driven mostly by the increase in oil, NGL and gas sales over third quarter 2010.
     Exploration expense for third quarter 2011 was $2 million, or $3.22 per Boe, compared to $568,000, or $1.36 per Boe, in third quarter 2010. Exploration expense for third quarter 2011 and 2010 includes costs related to 3-D seismic data acquisition in Pangea West and Project Pangea. We began acquiring 3-D seismic data in Pangea West in September 2011. We believe Pangea West is prospective for the Wolffork oil shale and expect to drill our first horizontal Wolfcamp well in Pangea West in the first quarter of 2012.
     General and administrative expense ("G&A") for third quarter 2011 was $3.8 million, or $6.18 per Boe, compared to $3.2 million, or $7.68 per Boe, for third quarter 2010. The increase in G&A was
 
primarily due to salaries and benefits. The decrease in G&A per Boe was primarily attributable to an increase in production during third quarter 2011 over prior period production volumes.
     Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense ("DD&A") for third quarter 2011 was $8.4 million, or $13.65 per Boe, compared to $5.8 million, or $13.95 per Boe, for third quarter 2010. The increase in DD&A over the prior year period was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures in third quarter 2011. The decrease in DD&A per Boe compared to third quarter 2010 was primarily attributable to an increase in estimated proved developed reserves, partially offset by an increase in production and capitalized costs over third quarter 2010.
Operations Update
     During the third quarter of 2011, we drilled a total of 20 gross (20 net) wells, completed 14 gross (14 net) wells and recompleted four gross (four net) wells. Through September 30, 2011, we drilled 52 gross (47.3 net) wells, completed 49 gross (42.7 net) wells and recompleted six gross (six net) wells. At September 30, 2011, we had 10 wells waiting on completion. We currently have one horizontal rig and two vertical rigs running in Project Pangea. We expect to drill a total of approximately 58 vertical wells and 13 horizontal wells in 2011. Exploration and development drilling expenditures totaled $51.9 million for the third quarter of 2011, and $128.9 million for the first nine months of 2011.
Horizontal Wolfcamp Oil Shale Program
     During third quarter 2011, we completed three horizontal Wolfcamp wells. All three horizontal wells were completed with 23 fracture stimulation stages. The table below summarizes the 24-hour initial producing rates for these wells.
     Two horizontal Wolfcamp wells are waiting on completion, the University 42B #1001H well (7,769 feet lateral) and the University 45E #1101H well (7,712 feet lateral). We plan to complete both wells in November 2011. The University 42B #1001H well is the Company's first well testing a deeper zone, the Wolfcamp "C" zone, within the Wolfcamp formation. Our prior horizontal Wolfcamp wells tested the Wolfcamp "B" and "A" zones.
     We currently are drilling the University 45F #2301H well. We plan to drill this well to a lateral length of approximately 7,700 feet.
 
Vertical Wolffork Program
     Since March 2011, the Company has recompleted nine existing, producing wells in the Wolffork oil shale. The average initial producing rate for our Wolffork recompletions is 152 Boe/d, comprised of approximately 75% oil and NGLs. Additionally, the Company has drilled and completed seven vertical wells targeting the Wolffork oil shale. The average initial producing rate for the vertical Wolffork wells is 140 Boe/d, comprised of approximately 72% oil and NGLs.
2011 Capital Expenditures
     Total capital expenditures in 2011 are expected to be $260 million, with approximately $160.7 million allocated to drilling and completion projects in the Permian Basin, approximately $70.2 million allocated to the acquisition of the remaining 38% working interest in northern Project Pangea, approximately $29.1 million allocated to lease acquisitions, extensions and renewals in the Permian Basin, acquisition of 3-D seismic in Project Pangea and Pangea West, infrastructure and other expenditures.
     Commenting on the 2011 capital budget, Mr. Craft said, "The increase in capital expenditures is primarily due to de-risking our Wolffork oil shale play with a combination of horizontal, vertical, recompletion and infrastructure projects and the acquisition or extension of approximately 20,000 net acres in our Permian operating area in 2011. For 2011, we're on track to drill more vertical and horizontal wells, and we're drilling longer laterals and completing with more frac stages in our horizontal wells. Also, we completed two natural gas pipeline infrastructure projects for our production in northeast Project Pangea and Block 45. We are making a significant investment in our core asset base, which has transformed the Company from a natural gas company to an oil and liquids-weighted producer and which we believe has the potential to substantially increase our proved reserves over the next several years."
2012 Capital Expenditures
     The Company's Board of Directors approved a 2012 capital budget of $160 million for drilling and recompletions in the Company's Wolffork oil shale resource play in the Permian Basin. The capital budget excludes acquisitions and assumes an activity level similar to the Company's current program, including two vertical rigs, one horizontal rig and two to four recompletions per month. We estimate 2012 production will range between 2,800 MBoe and 3,000 MBoe, an increase of approximately 22% over 2011 estimated production, and will be comprised of approximately 65% oil and natural gas liquids.
     Our 2011 and 2012 capital budgets are subject to change depending upon a number of factors, including economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil, NGLs and gas, the availability of sufficient capital resources for drilling prospects, our financial results and the availability of lease extensions and renewals on reasonable terms.
 
2011 and 2012 Guidance
     The table below sets forth the Company's current production and operating costs and expenses guidance for 2011 and 2012. The guidance is forward-looking information that is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control.
Financial Update
     At September 30, 2011, we had a $300 million revolving credit agreement with a $200 million borrowing base and $122 million outstanding. At September 30, 2011, our liquidity was $78.4 million. Effective October 7, 2011, we entered into an eleventh amendment to our credit agreement, which, among other things, increased the borrowing base 30% to $260 million from $200 million. Including the increase in borrowing base, our liquidity would have been $138.4 million at September 30, 2011. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our calculation of "liquidity."
Commodity Derivatives Positions
     In October 2011, the Company added to its 2012 commodity derivatives positions with a crude oil collar contract covering 700 Bbls/d at a contract price of $85.00/Bbl  $97.50/Bbl. The following table sets forth our commodity derivative volumes and prices for 2011 and 2012.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures
     This release contains certain financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. We have provided reconciliations below of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and on the Non-GAAP Financial Information page in the Investor Relations section of our website at .
www.approachresources.com
Adjusted Net Income
     This release contains the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, which exclude the following items:
     The amounts included in the calculation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share below were computed in accordance with GAAP. We believe adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are useful to investors because they provide readers with a more meaningful measure of our profitability before recording certain items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably determined. However, these measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
     The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively (in thousands, except per-share amounts).
 
EBITDAX
     We define EBITDAX as net income, plus (1) exploration expense, (2) depletion, depreciation and amortization expense, (3) share-based compensation expense, (4) unrealized (gain) loss on commodity derivatives, (5) gain on sale of oil and gas properties, (6) interest expense and (7) income taxes. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flow as determined by GAAP. The amounts included in the calculation of EBITDAX were computed in accordance with GAAP. EBITDAX is presented herein and reconciled to the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund development and exploration activities. This measure is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
     The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDAX to net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively (in thousands, except per-share amounts).
 
Liquidity
     Liquidity is calculated by adding the net funds available under our revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents. We use liquidity as an indicator of the Company's ability to fund development and exploration activities. However, this measurement has limitations. This measurement can vary from year to year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the measurement on a company's financial statements. This measurement is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
     The table below summarizes our liquidity at September 30, 2011, and our liquidity at September 30, 2011, reflecting the October 2011 borrowing base increase to $260 million from $200 million.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary or (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be paid or reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representative and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel

provided
provided further
 
as contemplated by this Section 7(c), the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) . If the indemnification provided for in Sections 7(a) or 7(b) hereof is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such section, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Shares and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Shares. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriter, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution
(e) . The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 7(d) hereof. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 7(d) hereof shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any
Limitation on Liability
pro rata
 
such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Shares exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
(f) . The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies
8. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness of Agreement
9. . This Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Representative, by notice to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date or, in the case of the Option Shares, prior to the Additional Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Global Market, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade; (ii) trading of any securities issued or guaranteed by the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities; or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in the judgment of the Representative, is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Shares on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
Termination
10. .
Defaulting Underwriter
(a) If, on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Shares that it has agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Shares by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Shares, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Shares on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, for up to
 
five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Shares that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in Section 10(a) hereof, the aggregate number of Shares that remain unpurchased on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate number of Shares to be purchased on such date, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Shares that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder on such date plus such Underwriter's pro rata share (based on the number of Shares that such Underwriter agreed to purchase on such date) of the Shares of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in Section 10(a) hereof, the aggregate number of Shares that remain unpurchased on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate amount of Shares to be purchased on such date, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in Section 10(b) hereof, then this Agreement or, with respect to any Additional Closing Date, the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase Shares on the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
(d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
11. .
Payment of Expenses
(a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company will pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder, including without limitation, (i) the costs incident to the authorization, issuance, sale, preparation and delivery of the Shares and any taxes payable in that connection; (ii) the costs (other than the fees and expenses of underwriters' counsel related thereto) incident to the
 
preparation, printing and filing under the Securities Act of the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (including all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) and the distribution thereof; (iii) the costs of reproducing and distributing this Agreement; (iv) the fees and expenses of the Company's counsel and independent accountants; (v) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the registration or qualification of the Shares under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representative may designate (including the related fees and expenses reasonably incurred of counsel for the Underwriters); (vi) the cost of preparing stock certificates; (vii) the costs and charges of any transfer agent and any registrar; (viii) all expenses and application fees incurred in connection with any filing with, and clearance of the offering by, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority; (ix) all expenses incurred by the Company in connection with any "road show" presentation to potential investors; and (x) all expenses and application fees related to the listing of the Shares on the Nasdaq Global Market.
(b) If (i) the Company for any reason fails to tender the Shares for delivery to the Underwriters or (ii) the Underwriters decline to purchase the Shares for any reason permitted under this Agreement (other than Section 9), the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby.
12. . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and any controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. No purchaser of Shares from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor merely by reason of such purchase.

The opinions set forth above are subject to the following qualifications and exceptions:
(a) Our opinions are limited to Applicable Laws and also (i) in the case of our opinions in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7, the Securities Act; (ii) in the case of our opinion in paragraph 9, the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; (iii) in the case of our opinion in paragraph 10, the Exchange Act; (iv) in the case of our opinion in paragraph 11, the Investment Company Act; and (v) in the case of our opinion in paragraph 3, to the limited extent set forth therein, the law of the states referred to in Schedule I.B hereto, and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any other laws.

In the course of our acting as counsel to the Company in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus Supplement relating to the offering and sale of the Shares, we reviewed the Registration Statement and the Prospectus Supplement, together with the Time of Sale Information and participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the Underwriters and the Underwriters' counsel, and representatives of the independent public accountants for the Company, at which the contents of the Registration Statement and Prospectus Supplement and Time of Sale Information and related matters were discussed. We did not participate in the preparation of the documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus Supplement. The purpose of our professional engagement was not to establish or confirm factual matters set forth in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus Supplement, and we have not undertaken to verify independently any of such factual matters. Moreover, many of the determinations required to be made in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus Supplement and the Time of Sale Information involve matters of a non-legal nature. Subject to the foregoing, we confirm to you that, on the basis of the information we gained in the course of performing the services referred to above, nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that:
(a) the Registration Statement, as of its most recent effective date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading;
(b) the Time of Sale Information, as of 5:00 p.m. eastern time on November 15, 2011 contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or
 
(c) the Prospectus Supplement, as of its date and as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
that we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus Supplement or the Time of Sale Information (except as otherwise specifically stated in paragraphs 8 and 9), and we do not express any belief with respect to, the financial statements, related notes or schedules or other financial data, accounting data or information or assessments of or reports on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; oil and gas reserves data; or statistical or accounting data derived from such financial and oil and gas reserves data contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus Supplement.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On February 20, 2012, the Compensation and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors of Approach Resources Inc. (the "Company") adopted a new form award agreement pursuant to which it may grant shares of restricted stock under the Company's 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the "Plan"), to certain named executive officers of the Company. The form award agreement provides for performance-based vesting conditions, with the restricted shares granted thereunder vesting at the end of a designated three-year performance period based on the total shareholder return ("TSR") achieved with respect to shares of the Company's common stock ("Common Stock"), and a comparison of the TSR achieved by 14 specified peer companies, provided the awardee remains continuously employed with the Company or its affiliates through the end of the applicable performance period. Depending on the relative TSR achieved by the Company, the awardee may earn between 0% and 150% of the target number of restricted shares covered by the award. The maximum number of shares that can be earned by the awardee is capped at 100% of the target if the Company's TSR is negative during the applicable performance period. If an awardee's employment or service is terminated due to death or disability before the end of the applicable performance period, the awardee will be deemed to earn 100% of the target number of restricted shares as of the date of termination. If a change of control occurs during the performance period, the awardee will be deemed to earn a number of restricted shares determined assuming that the performance period ends on the date of the change of control based on the relative TSR of the Company determined as of the date of the change of control. During the performance period, an awardee will have the right to receive any dividends paid with respect to 150% of the target number of restricted shares covered by the award.
The foregoing is intended to provide brief description of the new form award agreement, but is not a complete description and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report.

The TSR Vesting Objective for the Restricted Shares is outlined in this below. The "" means Approach's relative ranking in respect of the Performance Period with regard to Total Shareholder Return as compared to Total Shareholder Return of the Peer Companies. The Committee shall have the sole discretion for determining the level of achievement with respect to the TSR Vesting Objective and the number of Earned Restricted Shares, and any such determinations shall be conclusive.
Appendix A
TSR Vesting Objective
 
(a) "" means, as to Approach and each of the Peer Companies, the annualized rate of return shareholders receive through stock price changes and the assumed reinvestment of dividends paid over the Performance Period. Dividends per share paid other than in the form of cash shall have a value equal to the amount of such dividends reported by the issuer to its shareholders for purposes of Federal income taxation. For purposes of determining the Total Shareholder Return for Approach and each of the Peer Companies (except as provided below for Laredo Petroleum Holdings, Inc.), the change in the price of Approach's Common Stock and of the common stock of each Peer Company, as the case may be, shall be based upon the average of the closing stock prices of Approach and each such Peer Company on each trading day in the 30-day period preceding each of the start ("") and the end ("") of the Performance Period. The Initial Value of the Common Stock to be used to determine Total Shareholder Return over the Performance Period is $30.06.
Total Shareholder Return
Initial Value
Closing Value
(b) "" means a company that (i) has a class of common equity securities listed to trade under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""), during each day of the Performance Period, and (ii) is one of the following companies:
Peer Company
Exchange Act
 
In addition, if and solely to the extent that at the end of the Performance Period one or more of the 14 companies listed above fails to qualify as a "Peer Company," then such number of the following alternate companies (selected in the order presented below) as is necessary to have 14 Peer Companies shall be treated as Peer Companies for the entire Performance Period, provided that each such alternate company satisfies the requirement of having a class of common equity securities listed to trade under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act during each day of the Performance Period. For purposes of determining the Total Shareholder Return of Laredo Petroleum Holdings, Inc. ("LPI") the Initial Value of LPI's common stock shall be based upon the average of LPI's closing stock price on each trading day in the 17-day period preceding the start of the Performance Period.
 
If, after adding all eligible alternate companies, the number of companies qualifying as Peer Companies for the Performance Period is less than 14, the Committee shall, in good faith, determine the percentage of the Target Restricted Shares earned in a manner consistent with (a) the requirements to qualify the Restricted Shares as performance-based compensation exempt from the limitations imposed by Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to the extent the Committee determines that such qualification is in Approach's best interest, and (b) the following general guidelines for determining the number of Earned Restricted Shares:
(i) If the Company's Total Shareholder Return ranks in the 90th percentile or above as compared to the Total Shareholder Return of the qualifying Peer Companies, the number of Earned Restricted Shares shall equal the Maximum Restricted Shares;
(ii) If the Company's Total Shareholder Return ranks in the 55th percentile as compared to the Total Shareholder Return of the qualifying Peer Companies (or, the next percentile above 55 that applies if the actual determination of the Total Shareholder Return rankings for the Performance Period does not include the 55th percentile (., the 57th percentile ranking in the table in Section 2 below)), the number of Earned Restricted Shares shall equal the Target Restricted Shares;
e.g
 
(iii) If the Company's Total Shareholder Return ranks in the 40th percentile as compared to the Total Shareholder Return of the qualifying Peer Companies (or, the next percentile above 40 that applies if the actual determination of the Total Shareholder Return rankings for the Performance Period does not include the 40th percentile (., the 43rd percentile ranking in the table in Section 2 below), the number of Earned Restricted Shares shall equal 50% of the Target Restricted Shares (such percentage of the Target Restricted Shares, the "");
e.g
Threshold Restricted Shares
(iv) If the Company's Total Shareholder Return ranks below the 40th percentile as compared to the Total Shareholder Return of the qualifying Peer Companies, no Restricted Shares will become Earned Restricted Shares; and
(v) If the Company's Total Shareholder Return ranking falls in between the levels specified above for earning the Maximum Restricted Shares, the Target Restricted Shares and the Threshold Restricted Shares, the Committee shall have the discretion to determine the percentage of the Target Restricted Shares that become Earned Restricted Shares within the levels specified above.
 
(c) "" means the three year period commencing on January 1, and ending on December 31, [TWO YEARS AFTER YEAR OF GRANT DATE].
Performance Period

After the end of the Performance Period, the Committee will determine Approach's Total Shareholder Return as compared to Total Shareholder Return of the Peer Companies and will certify the level of achievement with respect to the TSR Vesting Objective and the number of Earned Restricted Shares in accordance with the following table:
2.
Calculation of Ranking; Earned Restricted Shares
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) if Approach's absolute Total Shareholder Return for the Performance Period is negative, the number of Earned Restricted Shares shall not exceed the Target Restricted Shares, and (b) no Restricted Shares will become Earned Restricted Shares unless Participant also satisfies the Continuous Service Requirement in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.

For Immediate Release
March 8, 2012
 Approach Resources Inc. today reported results for fourth quarter and full year 2011. Highlights for 2011, compared to 2010, include:
Fort Worth, Texas, MARCH 8, 2012
(NASDAQ: AREX)
 
 
 
 
 
 
2011 Financial Results
Production for 2011 totaled 2,338 MBoe (6.4 MBoe/d), compared to 1,556 MBoe (4.3 MBoe/d) in 2010, a 50% increase. Oil and NGL production for 2011 increased 152% to 1,280 MBbls, compared to 507 MBbls produced in 2010. Production for 2011 was 55% oil and NGLs and 45% natural gas, compared to 33% oil and NGLs and 67% natural gas in 2010.
Net income for 2011 was $7.2 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, on revenues of $108.4 million. This compares to net income for 2010 of $7.5 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, on revenues of $57.6 million. The $50.8 million increase in revenues in 2011 was attributable to an increase in production volumes ($48.6 million) and an increase in commodity prices ($2.2 million). Net income for 2011 included a realized gain on commodity derivatives of $3.4 million, an unrealized loss on commodity derivatives of $347,000 and impairment expense of $18.5 million.
Excluding the unrealized loss on commodity derivatives, impairment expense and related income taxes, adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for 2011 was $19.5 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, compared to $8.7 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, for 2010. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income.
EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for 2011 was $79.4 million, or $2.72 per diluted share, compared to $43 million, or $1.94 per diluted share, for 2010. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of EBITDAX to net income.
Average realized prices for 2011, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $88.18 per Bbl of oil, $51.39 per Bbl of NGLs and $3.92 per Mcf of natural gas, compared to $75.67 per Bbl of oil, $41.19 per Bbl of NGLs and $4.48 per Mcf of natural gas, for 2010. Our average realized price, including the effect of commodity derivatives, was $47.81 per Boe for 2011, compared to $40.72 per Boe for 2010.
Lease operating expense ("LOE") for 2011 was $13.3 million, or $5.70 per Boe, compared to $8.6 million, or $5.50 per Boe, in 2010. The increase in LOE compared to 2010 was primarily due to the
 
increase in our working interest in northwest Project Pangea. In February 2011, we acquired the remaining 38% working interest in northwest Project Pangea, which increased our working interest to approximately 100%. We also experienced an increase in well repair and maintenance expenses as well as generally higher service costs in 2011.
Severance and production taxes for 2011 were $5.8 million, or $2.48 per Boe, compared to $3 million, or $1.92 per Boe, in 2010. Severance and production taxes were approximately 5.4% and 5.2% of oil, NGL and gas sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in severance and production taxes was driven mostly by the increase in oil, NGL and gas sales over 2010.
Exploration expense for 2011 was $9.5 million, or $4.08 per Boe, compared to $2.6 million, or $1.66 per Boe, in 2010. Exploration expense for 2011 and 2010 includes costs related to 3-D seismic data acquisition in the Permian Basin. Exploration expense for 2011 and 2010 also includes lease extensions and expirations in the Permian Basin.
Impairment expense for 2011 was $18.5 million, compared to $2.6 million in 2010. Due to ongoing, low natural gas prices and to the further decline in natural gas prices during the three months ended December 31, 2011, we recorded an impairment expense to our oil and gas properties in the East Texas Basin of $15.2 million in 2011. We also recorded an impairment expense of $3.3 million for the remaining carrying costs associated with our unproved properties in Northern New Mexico. The 2010 impairment expense was due to a write down of carrying costs associated with our unproved properties in Southwest Kentucky.
General and administrative expense ("G&A") for 2011 was $17.9 million, or $7.66 per Boe, compared to $11.4 million, or $7.34 per Boe, for 2010. The increase in G&A was primarily due to salaries and benefits and share-based compensation.
Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense ("DD&A") for 2011 was $32.5 million, or $13.89 per Boe, compared to $22.2 million, or $14.28 per Boe, for 2010. The increase in DD&A over the prior year was primarily due to an increase in production and capital expenditures in 2011, partially offset by an increase in estimated proved developed reserves. The decrease in DD&A per Boe compared to 2010 was primarily attributable to an increase in estimated proved developed reserves, partially offset by an increase in production and capitalized costs over 2010.
Fourth Quarter 2011 Financial Results
Production for fourth quarter 2011 totaled 649 MBoe (7.1 MBoe/d), compared to 436 MBoe (4.7 MBoe/d) in fourth quarter 2010, a 49% increase. Oil and NGL production for fourth quarter 2011 increased 146% to 396 MBbls, compared to 161 MBbls produced in fourth quarter 2010. Production for fourth quarter 2011 was 61% oil and NGLs and 39% natural gas, compared to 37% oil and NGLs and 63% natural gas in fourth quarter 2010.
Net loss for fourth quarter 2011 was $9.3 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, on revenues of $31.1 million. This compares to net income for fourth quarter 2010 of $261,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, on revenues of $16.3 million. The $14.8 million increase in revenues in fourth quarter 2011 was attributable to an increase in production volumes ($15 million), partially offset by a decrease in commodity prices ($203,000). Net loss for fourth quarter 2011 included a realized gain on commodity derivatives of $1.7 million, an unrealized loss on commodity derivatives of $4.2 million and impairment expense of $18.5 million.
 
 
 
Excluding the unrealized loss on commodity derivatives, impairment expense and related income taxes, adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for fourth quarter 2011 was $5.8 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to $3.4 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for fourth quarter 2010. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income.
EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for fourth quarter 2011 was $22.8 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, compared to $12.1 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for fourth quarter 2010. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of EBITDAX to net income.
Average realized prices for fourth quarter 2011, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $85.56 per Bbl of oil, $51.71 per Bbl of NGLs and $3.19 per Mcf of natural gas, compared to $80.91 per Bbl of oil, $44.27 per Bbl of NGLs and $3.90 per Mcf of natural gas, for fourth quarter 2010. Our average realized price, including the effect of commodity derivatives, was $50.63 per Boe for fourth quarter 2011, compared to $42.34 per Boe for fourth quarter 2010.
LOE for fourth quarter 2011 was $3.5 million, or $5.41 per Boe, compared to $2.5 million, or $5.77 per Boe, in fourth quarter 2010. The increase in LOE compared to fourth quarter 2010 was primarily due to the increase in our working interest in northwest Project Pangea. In February 2011, we acquired the remaining 38% working interest in northwest Project Pangea, which increased our working interest to approximately 100%. We also experienced an increase in well repair and maintenance expenses as well as generally higher service costs in the 2011 period.
Severance and production taxes for fourth quarter 2011 were $1.6 million, or $2.44 per Boe, compared to $944,000, or $2.17 per Boe, in fourth quarter 2010. Severance and production taxes were approximately 5.1% and 5.8% of oil, NGL and gas sales for fourth quarter 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in severance and production taxes was driven mostly by the increase in oil, NGL and gas sales over fourth quarter 2010. The decrease in severance and production taxes as a percent of oil, NGL and gas sales was primarily due to a change in our production mix and timing of estimated refunds.
Exploration expense for fourth quarter 2011 was $2.7 million, or $4.11 per Boe, compared to $345,000, or $0.79 per Boe, in fourth quarter 2010. Exploration expense for fourth quarter 2011 and 2010 includes costs related to 3-D seismic data acquisition in the Permian Basin.
Impairment expense for fourth quarter 2011 was $18.5 million, compared to $2.6 million in fourth quarter 2010. Due to ongoing, low natural gas prices and to the further decline in natural gas prices during the three months ended December 31, 2011, we recorded an impairment expense to our oil and gas properties in the East Texas Basin of $15.2 million in 2011. We also recorded an impairment expense of $3.3 million for the remaining carrying costs associated with our unproved properties in Northern New Mexico.
G&A for fourth quarter 2011 was $6 million, or $9.28 per Boe, compared to $3.5 million, or $8.07 per Boe, for fourth quarter 2010. The increase in G&A was primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits and share-based compensation.
 
 
 
DD&A for fourth quarter 2011 was $10.1 million, or $15.53 per Boe, compared to $5.5 million, or $12.72 per Boe, for fourth quarter 2010. The increase in DD&A over the prior year period was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures and production volumes in fourth quarter 2011.
Capital Expenditures
Costs incurred during 2011 totaled $285.8 million, and included $192.5 million for exploration and development drilling, $70.8 million for the purchase of additional working interest in northwest Project Pangea and $22.5 million for acreage acquisitions.
Our capital budget for 2012 is $190 million. Substantially all of our 2012 capital expenditures will be allocated to drilling and development of our Wolffork oil shale resource play in the Permian Basin. Our 2012 capital budget is subject to change depending upon a number of factors, including economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil, NGLs and gas, the availability of sufficient capital resources for drilling prospects, our financial results and the availability of lease extensions and renewals on reasonable terms.
The table below sets forth the Company's current production and operating costs and expenses guidance for 2012. The guidance is forward-looking information that is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control.
 
Operations Update
During 2011, we drilled a total of 71 gross (66.2 net) wells, of which 18 gross (18 net) were waiting on completion at December 31, 2011. We also recompleted 10 gross (10 net) wells in the Wolffork in 2011. We currently are operating two rigs targeting the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale and one rig targeting the vertical Wolffork.
 
 
 
Liquidity and Commodity Derivatives Update
At December 31, 2011, we had a $300 million revolving credit agreement with a $260 million borrowing base and $43.8 million outstanding. At December 31, 2011, our liquidity and long-term debt to capital ratio were $216.2 million and 8.6%, respectively. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our calculation of "liquidity" and "long-term debt to capital ratio."
We enter into commodity derivatives positions to reduce the risk of commodity price fluctuations. Please refer to the "Unaudited Commodity Derivatives Information" table below for a detailed summary of the Company's current derivatives positions.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures
This release contains certain financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. We have provided reconciliations below of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and on the Non-GAAP Financial Information page in the Investor Relations section of our website at . 
www.approachresources.com
Adjusted Net Income
This release contains the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, which excludes (1) impairment expense, (2) unrealized loss (gain) on commodity derivatives, (3) loss (gain) on sale of oil and gas properties and (4) related income taxes. The amounts included in the calculation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share below were computed in accordance with GAAP. We believe adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are useful to investors because they provide readers with a more meaningful measure of our profitability before recording certain items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably determined. However, these measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website. The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income for the three months and year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively (in thousands, except per-share amounts).
 
EBITDAX
We define EBITDAX as net income, plus (1) exploration expense, (2) impairment expense, (3) depletion, depreciation and amortization expense, (4) share-based compensation expense, (5) unrealized loss (gain) on commodity derivatives, (6) loss (gain) on sale of oil and gas properties, (7) interest expense and (8) income taxes. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flow as determined by GAAP. The amounts included in the calculation of EBITDAX were computed in accordance with GAAP. EBITDAX is presented herein and reconciled to the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund development and exploration activities. This measure is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website. The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDAX to net income for the three months and year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively (in thousands, except per-share amounts).
 
 
 
 
Liquidity
Liquidity is calculated by adding the net funds available under our revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents. We use liquidity as an indicator of the Company's ability to fund development and exploration activities. However, this measurement has limitations. This measurement can vary from year to year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the measurement on a company's financial statements. This measurement is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website. The table below summarizes our liquidity at December 31, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands).
 
Long-Term Debt-to-Capital
Long-term debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as of December 31, 2011, and by dividing long-term debt (GAAP) by the sum of total stockholders' equity (GAAP) and long-term debt (GAAP). We use the long-term debt-to-capital ratio as a measurement of our overall financial leverage. However, this ratio has limitations. This ratio can vary from year to year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the ratio on a company's financial statements. This ratio is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information
 
 
 
contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website. The table below summarizes our long-term debt-to-capital ratio at December 31, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands).

Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
April 27, 2012
 Approach Resources Inc. today announced preliminary production, commodity price realizations and capital expenditures for first quarter 2012. Estimated first quarter 2012 production totaled 654 MBoe (7.2 MBoe/d), compared to 469 MBoe (5.2 MBoe/d) produced in first quarter 2011, a 39% increase. Estimated oil and NGL production for first quarter 2012 increased 110% to 405 MBbls, compared to 193 MBbls produced in first quarter 2011. Estimated production for first quarter 2012 was 29% oil, 33% NGLs and 38% natural gas, compared to 19% oil, 22% NGLs and 59% natural gas in first quarter 2011.
FORT WORTH, TEXAS, April 27, 2012
(NASDAQ: AREX)
Preliminary, average realized prices for first quarter 2012, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $94.39 per Bbl of oil, $42.50 per Bbl of NGLs and $2.35 per Mcf of natural gas, compared to $90.67 per Bbl of oil, $48.04 per Bbl of NGLs and $4.30 per Mcf of natural gas for first quarter 2011. Our preliminary, average realized price, including the effect of commodity derivatives, was $46.10 per Boe for first quarter 2012, compared to $43.45 per Boe for first quarter 2011.
Preliminary, unaudited estimates of capital expenditures during first quarter 2012 totaled $77.6 million, and included $64.8 million for exploration and development drilling, $9.3 million for pipeline and infrastructure projects, 3-D seismic data acquisition and processing and purchase of trucks for crude and water hauling and $3.5 million for acreage acquisitions. During first quarter 2012, we drilled 15 wells and completed 22 wells, including 15 of 18 wells that were waiting on completion at year end 2011. At March 31, 2012, we had 11 wells waiting on completion.
Borrowing Base Increase
Effective April 26, 2012, the lenders to our credit agreement increased our borrowing base to $270 million from $260 million.
Management Comment
"In the first quarter of 2012, we drilled and completed more vertical Wolffork wells than planned and worked down our inventory of wells waiting on completion," said J. Ross Craft, Approach's President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our vertical Wolffork wells provide valuable technical information, enable us to satisfy lease commitments and allow us to target the 2,500-feet thick Clearfork, Dean and Wolfcamp zones. We also continue to make significant investments in Project Pangea and Pangea West, including several infrastructure projects to facilitate our future growth. These upfront investments will be key drivers that should enable us to increase crude transport capacity for our growing oil production, reduce drilling and completion costs, decrease fresh water usage and efficiently develop the resource potential beneath our acreage position in the Southern Midland Basin."

Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
May 3, 2012
 Approach Resources Inc. today reported results for first quarter 2012. Highlights for first quarter 2012, compared to first quarter 2011, include:
FORT WORTH, TEXAS, May 3, 2012
(NASDAQ: AREX)
 
 
 
 
 
 
First quarter 2012 production totaled 654 MBoe (7.2 MBoe/d), compared to 469 MBoe (5.2 MBoe/d) produced in first quarter 2011, a 39% increase. Oil and NGL production for first quarter 2012 increased 110% to 405 MBbls, compared to 193 MBbls produced in first quarter 2011. Production for first quarter 2012 was 29% oil, 33% NGLs and 38% natural gas, compared to 19% oil, 22% NGLs and 59% natural gas in first quarter 2011.
First Quarter 2012 Financial Results
Net income for first quarter 2012 was $1.7 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, on revenues of $30.6 million. This compares to net income for first quarter 2011 of $1.5 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, on revenues of $20.2 million. The $10.4 million increase in revenues in first quarter 2012 was attributable to an increase in production volumes and oil prices ($14.3 million), which was offset by a decrease in NGL and natural gas prices ($3.9 million). Net income for first quarter 2012 included an unrealized loss on commodity derivatives of $2.7 million and a realized loss on commodity derivatives of $484,000. Net income for first quarter 2012 was also impacted by higher expenses, including depreciation, depletion and amortization, general and administrative, lease operating and severance and production taxes, partially offset by lower exploration expense, compared to first quarter 2011.
Excluding the unrealized loss on commodity derivatives and related income taxes, adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for first quarter 2012 was $3.5 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to $1.2 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, for first quarter 2011. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income.
EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for first quarter 2012 was $20.8 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, compared to $14 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for first quarter 2011. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of EBITDAX to net income.
 
Average realized prices for first quarter 2012, before the effect of commodity derivatives were $94.39 per Bbl of oil, $42.50 per Bbl of NGLs and $2.35 per Mcf of natural gas, compared to $90.67 per Bbl of oil, $48.04 per Bbl of NGLs and $4.30 per Mcf of natural gas for first quarter 2011. Our average realized price, including the effect of commodity derivatives, was $46.10 per Boe for first quarter 2012, compared to $43.45 per Boe for first quarter 2011.
Lease operating expense ("LOE") for first quarter 2012 was $4.3 million, or $6.52 per Boe, compared to $2.6 million, or $5.64 per Boe, in first quarter 2011. The increase in LOE over the prior year quarter was primarily attributable to an increase in working interest in Project Pangea as well as an increase in compressor rental and repair, pumpers and supervision, water hauling, insurance and well repairs and maintenance.
Severance and production taxes for first quarter 2012 were $1.5 million, or $2.35 per Boe, compared to $1.1 million, or $2.35 per Boe, in first quarter 2011. Severance and production taxes were approximately 5.0% and 5.5% of oil, NGL and gas sales for first quarter 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Exploration expense for first quarter 2012 was $1.3 million, or $1.97 per Boe, compared to $4.6 million, or $9.87 per Boe, in first quarter 2011. Exploration expense for first quarter 2012 includes costs related to 3-D seismic data acquisition and processing. Exploration expense for first quarter 2011 was primarily due to lease extensions and expirations in Project Pangea.
General and administrative expense ("G&A") for first quarter 2012 was $5.8 million, or $8.82 per Boe, compared to $3.5 million, or $7.46 per Boe, for first quarter 2011. The increase in G&A was primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation and salaries and benefits resulting from increased staffing.
Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense ("DD&A") for first quarter 2012 was $11 million, or $16.87 per Boe, compared to $6.1 million, or $12.90 per Boe, for first quarter 2011. The increase in DD&A over the prior year quarter was primarily due to an increase in drilling and development capital expenditures.
Operations Update
During first quarter 2012, we drilled 15 wells and completed 22 wells, including 15 of 18 wells that were waiting on completion at year end 2011. At March 31, 2012, we had 11 wells waiting on completion. We currently have two horizontal rigs working, one in Project Pangea and one in Pangea West, as well as one vertical rig in Project Pangea.
We recently completed four horizontal Wolfcamp wells, targeting the Wolfcamp "B" zone. The table below summarizes the 24-hour initial producing rates for these wells.
 
 
Liquidity and Commodity Derivatives Update  Borrowing Base Increase
At March 31, 2012, we had a $300 million revolving credit agreement with a $260 million borrowing base and $85.4 million outstanding. At March 31, 2012, our liquidity and long-term debt to capital ratio were $174.7 million and 15.3%, respectively. Effective April 26, 2012, the lenders to our credit agreement increased our borrowing base to $270 million. Including the borrowing base increase, our liquidity would have been $184.7 million at March 31, 2012. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our calculation of "liquidity" and "long-term debt-to-capital ratio."
We enter into commodity derivatives positions to reduce the risk of commodity price fluctuations. Please refer to the "Unaudited Commodity Derivatives Information" table below for a detailed summary of the Company's current derivatives positions.
2012 Capital Expenditures
Costs incurred during first quarter 2012 totaled $77.6 million, and included $64.8 million for exploration and development drilling, $9.3 million for pipeline and infrastructure projects, 3-D seismic data acquisition and processing and purchase of trucks for crude and water hauling and $3.5 million for acreage acquisitions.
We have increased our 2012 capital budget to $260 million from $190 million. This increase relates to $12.6 million for our horizontal Wolfcamp drilling program, $29.5 million for our vertical Wolffork drilling and recompletion programs and $27.9 million for infrastructure and other equipment, 3-D seismic and acreage acquisitions. We also have raised our production guidance to 2,900 MBoe  3,100 MBoe.
Our 2012 capital budget is subject to change depending upon a number of factors, including economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil, NGLs and gas, the availability of sufficient capital resources for drilling prospects, our financial results and the availability of lease extensions and renewals on reasonable terms.
The table below sets forth the Company's current production and operating costs and expenses guidance for 2012. The guidance is forward-looking information that is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures

We have provided reconciliations below of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and on the Non-GAAP Financial Information page in the Investor Relations section of our website at . 
www.approachresources.com
Adjusted Net Income
This release contains the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, which excludes (1) unrealized loss on commodity derivatives, (2) gain on sale of oil and gas properties, and (3) related income taxes. The amounts included in the calculation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share below were computed in accordance with GAAP. We believe adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are useful to investors because they provide readers with a more meaningful measure of our profitability before recording certain items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably determined. However, these measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website. The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands, except per-share amounts).
 
 
EBITDAX
We define EBITDAX as net income, plus (1) exploration expense, (2) depletion, depreciation and amortization expense, (3) share-based compensation expense, (4) unrealized loss on commodity derivatives, (5) gain on sale of oil and gas properties, (6) interest expense, and (7) income taxes. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flow as determined by GAAP. The amounts included in the calculation of EBITDAX were computed in accordance with GAAP. EBITDAX is presented herein and reconciled to the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund development and exploration activities. This measure is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website. The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDAX to net income for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively (in thousands, except per-share amounts).
 
 
Liquidity
Liquidity is calculated by adding the net funds available under our revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents. We use liquidity as an indicator of the Company's ability to fund development and exploration activities. However, this measurement has limitations. This measurement can vary from year to year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the measurement on a company's financial statements. This measurement is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website. The table below summarizes our liquidity at March 31, 2012, and our liquidity at March 31, 2012, reflecting the April 2012 borrowing base increase (in thousands).
 
Long-Term Debt-to-Capital
Long-term debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as of March 31, 2012, and by dividing long-term debt (GAAP) by the sum of total stockholders' equity (GAAP) and long-term debt (GAAP). We use the long-term debt-to-capital ratio as a measurement of our overall financial leverage. However, this ratio has limitations. This ratio can vary from year to year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the ratio on a company's financial statements. This ratio is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website. The table below summarizes our long-term debt-to-capital ratio at March 31, 2012, and December 31, 2011 (in thousands).

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 2, 2012, the Board of Directors of Approach Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), approved the Company's entry into amended and restated indemnity agreements (the "Indemnity Agreements") with each of its directors and executive officers in the form attached as Exhibit 10.1. The new Indemnity Agreements will supersede and replace the indemnity agreements previously in effect between the Company and such directors and executive officers. The Company may from time to time enter into additional indemnity agreements with other of its future directors and officers using the same form of Indemnity Agreement.
The Indemnity Agreements generally provide that the Company will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify and hold harmless each indemnitee that, because the indemnitee is or was a director or officer of the Company, is or is threatened to be made a party to or a participant in any civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative or investigative proceeding against all expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the indemnitee in connection with any such proceeding. The Indemnity Agreements provide the indemnitee with indemnification rights in connection with third-party proceedings and proceedings brought by or in the right of the Company. In addition, the Indemnity Agreements provide for the advancement of expenses incurred, or in the case of retainers, to be incurred, by the indemnitee in connection with any covered proceeding to the fullest extent permitted by law. The Indemnity Agreements also provide that if the indemnification rights are unavailable for any reason, the Company, in lieu of indemnifying or causing the indemnification of the indemnitee, will contribute to the amount the indemnitee has incurred, whether for judgments, fines, penalties, excise taxes, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement or for expenses reasonably incurred, in connection with such proceeding, in such proportion as is deemed fair and reasonable in light of all circumstances of that proceeding in order to reflect the relative benefits received or fault of the indemnitee and the Company, as applicable.
The rights provided by the Indemnity Agreements are in addition to any other rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses to which the indemnitee may be entitled under law, the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Restated Bylaws, or otherwise.
The foregoing summary of the material terms of the Indemnity Agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the form of such agreement, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: May 7, 2012
 
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
This Amended and Restated Agreement (this "Agreement") made and entered into as of this day of , 2012, by and between Approach Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and ("Indemnitee"), who is currently serving the Company in the capacity of a director and/or officer thereof.
        
                                    
                            
WHEREAS, the Company and Indemnitee entered into an Indemnity Agreement as of July 12, 2007 and an amendment thereto effective as of December 31, 2008 (as amended, the "Original Agreement");
WHEREAS, the Company and Indemnitee recognize that the interpretation of ambiguous statutes, regulations and court opinions and of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the "Charter") and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the "Bylaws"), and the vagaries of public policy, are too uncertain to provide the directors and officers of the Company with adequate or reliable advance knowledge or guidance with respect to the legal risks and potential liabilities to which they become personally exposed as a result of performing their duties in good faith for the Company; and
WHEREAS, the Company and the Indemnitee are aware that highly experienced and capable persons are often reluctant to serve as directors or officers of a corporation unless they are protected to the fullest extent permitted by law by comprehensive insurance and indemnification, especially since the legal risks and potential liabilities, and the very threat thereof, associated with lawsuits filed against the officers and directors of a corporation, and the resultant substantial time, expense, harassment, ridicule, abuse and anxiety spent and endured in defending against such lawsuits, whether or not meritorious, bear no reasonable or logical relationship to the amount of compensation received by the directors or officers from the corporation; and
WHEREAS, Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Charter, which set forth certain provisions relating to the mandatory and permissive indemnification of, and advancement of expenses to, officers and directors (among others) of a Delaware corporation by such corporation, are specifically not exclusive of other rights to which those indemnified thereunder may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise; and
WHEREAS, after due consideration and investigation of the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the various other options available to the Company and the Indemnitee in lieu thereof, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that the following Agreement is not only reasonable and prudent but necessary to promote and ensure the best interests of the Company and its stockholders; and
WHEREAS, the Company desires to have Indemnitee serve or continue to serve as an officer and/or director of the Company, free from undue concern for unpredictable, inappropriate or unreasonable legal risks and personal liabilities by reason of his acting in good faith in the performance of his duty to the Company; and Indemnitee desires to serve, or to continue to serve (provided that he is furnished the indemnity provided for hereinafter), in either or both of such capacities;
WHEREAS, the Company and Indemnity now desire to amend and restate the Original Indemnity Agreement as set forth in this Agreement;
WHEREAS, this Agreement is intended to provide indemnification and advancement rights in addition to those provided by the Charter, the Bylaws and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, and shall not be deemed a substitute therefore, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of Indemnitee thereunder;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements herein set forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Company and Indemnitee, intending to be legally bound, do hereby agree that the Original Agreement shall be amended and restated as follows:
. Indemnitee agrees to serve or continue to serve as director and/or officer of the Company and as Indemnitee and the Company may agree, as a director, officer, trustee, general partner, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent of another Enterprise, until his earlier death, retirement, resignation or removal in accordance with the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Charter and Bylaws. The Company acknowledges that the Indemnitee is relying on this Agreement in so serving. The Indemnitee may at any time and for any reason resign from such position (subject to any other obligation, whether contractual or imposed by operation of law), in which event this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect after such resignation as provided in Section 26 hereof.

Such request shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by, or in the case of retainers, to be incurred by, Indemnitee in connection therewith. Indemnitee shall qualify for advances upon the execution and delivery to the Company of this Agreement, which shall constitute an undertaking providing that Indemnitee undertakes to repay the advanced Expenses to the Company to the extent that it is ultimately determined that the undersigned Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified therefor by the Company. Such undertaking shall be an unlimited general obligation of Indemnitee. The Company acknowledges and agrees that this agreement of Indemnitee to repay is unsecured and interest free and that advances hereunder shall be made without reference to Indemnitee's financial ability to make repayment.
7. Advances of Expenses.
8. Procedure for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in order to obtain the indemnification provided under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request, including documentation and information which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification. The Secretary of the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of a request for indemnification, advise the Board of Directors that Indemnitee has requested indemnification. Any Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with Indemnitee's request for indemnification hereunder shall be borne by the Company.
(b) Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to Section 8(a) hereof, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement thereto shall be made in the specific case: (i) if a Change in Control shall have occurred, the Disinterested Directors shall direct Independent Counsel to make such determination in a written opinion to the Board of Directors of the Company, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee; or (ii) if a Change in Control shall not have occurred, (A) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors of the Company, or (B) by a committee of the Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote of Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (C) if there are no Disinterested Directors
 
or, if the Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors of the Company, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee; and, if it is so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within 10 days after such determination. Any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by Indemnitee in cooperating with the person, persons or entity making the determination discussed in this Section 8(b) with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification, shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification) and the Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.
(c) In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 8(b) hereof, the Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 8(c). If a Change in Control shall not have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board of Directors of the Company, and the Company shall give written notice to Indemnitee advising him of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. If a Change in Control shall have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee (unless Indemnitee shall request that such selection be made by the Board of Directors of the Company, in which event the preceding sentence shall apply), and Indemnitee shall give written notice to the Company advising it of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. In either event, Indemnitee or the Company, as the case may be, may, within 10 days after such written notice of selection shall have been given, deliver to the Company or to Indemnitee, as the case may be, a written objection to such selection; provided, however, that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of "Independent Counsel" as defined in this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If such written objection is so made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within 20 days after submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 8(b) hereof, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, either the Company or Indemnitee may petition the Delaware Court of Chancery or other court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Company or Indemnitee to the other's selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the Court or by such other person as the Court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section 8(a) hereof.
(d) Indemnitee will be deemed a party to a Proceeding for all purposes hereof if Indemnitee is named as a defendant or respondent in a complaint or petition for relief in that Proceeding, regardless of whether Indemnitee is ever served with process or makes an appearance in that Proceeding.
 
(e) Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder without a separate determination by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to Section 8(b) hereof with respect to any Proceeding and/or any claim, issue or matter with respect thereto: (i) which is resolved by agreement without any payment or assumption or admission of liability by Indemnitee; or (ii) as to which a final decision on the merits has been made by the court or other body with jurisdiction over that Proceeding, in which Indemnitee was not determined to be liable with respect to such claim, issue or matter asserted against Indemnitee in the Proceeding.
9. Presumptions and Effect of Certain Provisions.
(a) In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, Indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to full indemnification under this Agreement, and the Company shall have the burden of proof in the making of any determination contrary to such presumption. Neither the failure of the Company (including its Board of Directors or independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Company (including its Board of Directors or independent legal counsel) that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense or admissible as evidence in any Proceeding for any purpose or create a presumption that Indemnitee has acted in bad faith or has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
(b) If the person, persons or entity empowered or selected under Section 8 of this Agreement to determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification shall not have made a determination within 30 days after receipt by the Company therefor, the requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made and Indemnitee shall be entitled to such indemnification, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee's statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law; provided, however, that such 30-day period may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed an additional 15 days, if the person, persons or entity making the determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification in good faith requires such additional time for the obtaining or evaluating of documentation and/or information relating thereto. The termination of any Proceeding described in this Agreement by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself: (i) create a presumption that Indemnitee acted in bad faith or in a manner which he/she reasonably believed to be opposed to the best interests of the Company, or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that Indemnitee has reasonable cause to believe that Indemnitee's conduct was unlawful; or (ii) otherwise adversely affect the rights of Indemnitee to indemnification, except as may be provided herein.
 
(c) For purposes of this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful (collectively, "Good Faith"), if such action was based in good faith reliance on any of the following: (i) the records or books of account of the Company and any other Enterprise of which Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, trustee, general partner, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent or information, opinions, reports or statements, including financial statements and other financial information, concerning the Company and any other Enterprise of which Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, trustee, general partner, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent; (ii) information or records supplied to Indemnitee by one or more officers or employees of the Company and any Enterprise of which Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, trustee, general partner, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent in the course of his/her duties; (iii) information or records given in reports made to the Company or any other Enterprise of which Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, trustee, general partner, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent, or supplied to Indemnitee by appraisers, engineers, investment bankers, legal counsel, independent certified public accountants or other persons as to matters Indemnitee reasonably believed were within the professional or expert competence of those persons; or (iv) the advice of legal counsel for the Company or any other Enterprise of which Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, trustee, general partner, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent. The provisions of this Section 9(c) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement.
(d) The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any director, officer, agent or employee of the Company and any other Enterprise of which Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, trustee, general partner, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement.
10. Remedies of Indemnitee.
(a) In the event that (i) a determination is made pursuant to Section 8(b) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, (ii) advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section 7 of this Agreement, (iii) no determination of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made pursuant to Section 8(b) of this Agreement within the time period provided in Section 9(b) after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification, (iv) payment of indemnification is not made pursuant to Section 5, Section 6, the last sentence of Section 8(b) of this Agreement within 10 days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor, or (v) payment of indemnification pursuant to Section 3 or Section 4 of this Agreement is not made within 10 days after a determination has been made that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek a final adjudication by the Delaware Court of Chancery of his entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of Expenses and appeals therefrom, concluding in a final and unappealable judgment by the Delaware Supreme Court. The Board of Directors
 
shall not make a determination as to the final disposition of such adjudication. Alternatively, Indemnitee may, at Indemnitee's option, seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator chosen by Indemnitee and approved by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If Indemnitee and the Company do not agree upon an arbitrator within 30 days following notice to the Company by Indemnitee that it seeks an award in arbitration, the arbitrator will be chosen pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA"). The arbitration will be conducted pursuant to the rules of the AAA, and an award shall be made within 60 days following the filing of the demand for arbitration. The arbitration shall be held in Dallas, Texas. The Company shall not oppose Indemnitee's right to seek any such adjudication or award in arbitration or any other claim.
(b) In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 8(b) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this Section 10 shall be conducted in all respects as a de novo trial on the merits and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of that adverse determination.
(c) If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 8(b) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this Section 10, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee's statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law.
(d) In the event that Indemnitee, pursuant to this Section 10, seeks a judicial adjudication of his rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from the Company, and shall be indemnified by the Company against, any and all expenses (of the types described in the definition of Expenses in Section 2(d) of this Agreement) actually and reasonably incurred by him in such judicial adjudication regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to such indemnification.
(e) The Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this Section 10 that the procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement.
The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of Expenses as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee may be entitled under the Charter or Bylaws, any other agreement, any vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or otherwise. No amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement or of any provision hereof shall limit or restrict any right of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect of any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal. To the extent that a
11. Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses Under this Agreement Not Exclusive; Survival of Rights.
 
change in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, whether by statute or judicial decision, permits greater indemnification or advancement of Expenses than would be afforded currently under the Charter, Bylaws and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change. No right or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other right or remedy.
If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification or to receive advancement by the Company for a portion of the Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee (or on his behalf) in connection with such Proceeding, or any claim, issue or matter therein, but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which Indemnitee is entitled.
12. Partial Indemnification.
The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of Expenses as provided by this Agreement shall continue as to Indemnitee even though Indemnitee may have ceased to be a director or officer of the Company and shall inure to the benefit of Indemnitee's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.
13. Rights Continued.
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as giving Indemnitee any right to be retained in the employ or as an officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, if Indemnitee currently serves as an officer of the Company, or to be renominated or reelected as a director of the Company, if Indemnitee currently serves as a director of the Company or another Enterprise of which Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, trustee, general partner, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent, or affect the right of the Company to terminate, in the Company's sole discretion (with or without cause) and at any time, the Indemnitee's employment or position as a director, in each case, subject to any contractual rights of the Indemnitee existing otherwise than under this Agreement.
14. No Construction as an Employment Agreement or Any Other Commitment.
The Company shall, from time to time, make the good faith determination whether it is practicable for the Company to obtain and maintain a policy or policies of insurance with reputable insurance companies providing the officers and directors of the Company and any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company with coverage for losses from wrongful acts or to ensure the Company's performance of its indemnification obligations under this Agreement. Among other considerations, the Company will weigh the costs of obtaining such insurance coverage against the protection afforded by such coverage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have no obligation to obtain or maintain such insurance if the Company determines in good faith that such insurance is not necessary or is not reasonably available, if the premium costs for such insurance are disproportionate to the amount of coverage provided, if the coverage provided by such insurance is limited by exclusions so as to provide an insufficient benefit or if Indemnitee is covered by similar insurance maintained by
15. Liability Insurance.
 
a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. However, the Company's decision whether or not to adopt and maintain such insurance shall not affect in any way its obligations to indemnify Indemnitee under this Agreement or otherwise. To the extent the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies providing liability insurance for directors, officers, trustees, general partners, managing members, fiduciaries, employees or agents of the Company or any other Enterprise which such person serves at the request of the Company, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or their terms, to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any director, officer, trustee, general partner, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent under such policy or policies.
The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable under this Agreement if, and to the extent that, Indemnitee has otherwise actually received such payment under any contract, agreement or insurance policy, the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company, or otherwise.
16. No Duplication of Payments.
In the event of payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including without limitation the execution of such documents as may be necessary to enable the Company effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.
17. Subrogation.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the Company shall not be obligated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, to (i) indemnify or advance Expenses to Indemnitee with respect to any claim, issue or matter therein, brought or made by Indemnitee, whether asserted directly or by way of cross-claim, counter claim or the like (other than a claim to enforce Indemnitee's rights to indemnification and advancement of Expenses under this Agreement), or (ii) indemnify Indemnitee with respect to any Proceeding in which final judgment is rendered against Indemnitee for an accounting of profits made from the purchase and sale or the sale and purchase by Indemnitee of securities of the Company pursuant to the provisions of Section 16(b) of the Act.
18. Exceptions.
Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be given or made to the Company or Indemnitee pursuant to this Agreement shall be given if made in writing and deposited in the United States mail, with postage thereon prepaid, addressed to the person to whom such notice or communication is directed at the address of such person on the records of the Company, and such notice or communication shall be deemed given or made at the time when the same shall be so deposited in the United States mail. Any such notice or communication to the Company shall be addressed to the Secretary of the Company.
19. Notices.
The right to be indemnified or to receive advancement of Expenses under this Agreement (i) is a contract right based upon good and valuable consideration, pursuant to which Indemnitee may sue, (ii) is and is intended to be applicable to alleged acts or omissions occurring prior to the date of this Agreement and (iii) shall continue after any rescission or restrictive modification of this Agreement as to events occurring prior thereto.
20. Contractual Rights .
 
If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provisions held invalid, illegal or unenforceable; and those provision or provisions held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever shall be deemed reformed to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law and to give the maximum effect to the intent of the parties hereto.
21. Severability.
The provisions of this Agreement shall cover claims or Proceedings whether now pending or hereafter commenced and shall be applicable to acts or omissions or alleged acts or omissions which heretofore have taken place. The Company shall be liable under this Agreement, pursuant to Sections 3 and 4 hereof, for all acts of Indemnitee while serving as a director and/or officer, notwithstanding the termination of Indemnitee's service, if such act was performed or omitted to be performed during the term of the Indemnitee's service to the Company.
22. Effective Date.
The Company shall require and cause any successor (whether direct or indirect) by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company, by written agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitee, to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place. As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid that executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this Section 22 or that otherwise becomes bound by the terms and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns (including, without limitation, any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company) and will inure to the benefit of Indemnitee (and Indemnitee's spouse, if Indemnitee resides in Texas or another community property state), heirs, executors and administrators.
23. Successors; Binding Agreement.
24. Counterparts, Modification, Headings, Gender.
(a) This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall constitute one and the same instrument, and either party hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart.
(b) No provisions of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by Indemnitee and an appropriate officer of the Company. No waiver by any party at any time of any breach by any other party of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by any other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same time or at any prior or subsequent time.
 
(c) Section headings are not to be considered part of this Agreement, are solely for convenience of reference, and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any provision set forth herein.
(d) Pronouns in masculine, feminine and neuter genders shall be construed to include any other gender, and words in the singular form shall be construed to include the plural and vice versa, unless the context otherwise requires.
The Company and Indemnitee agree that all disputes in any way relating to or arising under this Agreement, including, without limitation, any action for advancement of Expenses or indemnification, shall be litigated, if at all, exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery, and if necessary, the corresponding appellate courts. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and to be performed in such state without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws. The Company and Indemnitee (i) expressly submit themselves to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery for purposes of any action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) irrevocably appoint, to the extent such party is not a resident of the State of Delaware, The Corporation Trust Company, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19801 as its agent in the State of Delaware as such party's agent for acceptance of legal process in connection with any such action or proceeding against such party with the same legal force and validity as if served upon such party personally within the State of Delaware, (iii) waive any objection to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (iv) waive, and agree not to plead or to make, any claim that any such action or proceeding brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery has been brought in an improper or otherwise inconvenient forum.
25. Exclusive Jurisdiction; Governing Law.
This Agreement shall continue until and terminate upon the later of: (a) 10 years after the date that Indemnitee shall have ceased to serve as a director and/or officer of the Company or director, officer, trustee, general partner, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent of any other Enterprise which Indemnitee served at the request of the Company; (b) one year after the final, nonappealable termination of any Proceeding then pending in respect of which Indemnitee is granted rights of indemnification or advancement of Expenses hereunder and of any proceeding commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to Section 10 of this Agreement relating thereto; or (c) the expiration of all statutes of limitation applicable to possible Proceedings to which Indemnitee may be subject arising out of Indemnitee's positions or relationships described in Sections 3 and 4 of this Agreement.
26. Duration of Agreement.
If it is established, under Section 8 or otherwise, that Indemnitee has the right to be indemnified under this Agreement in respect of any claim, but that right is unenforceable by reason of applicable law or public policy, then, to the fullest extent applicable law permits, the Company, in lieu of indemnifying or causing the indemnification of Indemnitee under this Agreement, will contribute to the amount Indemnitee has incurred, whether for judgments, fines, penalties, excise taxes, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement or for Expenses reasonably incurred, in connection with that Proceeding, in such proportion as is deemed fair and reasonable in light of all the circumstances of that Proceeding in order to reflect:
27. Contribution.
 
(a) the relative benefits Indemnitee and the Company have received as a result of the event(s) or transactions(s) giving rise to that Proceeding; or
(b) the relative fault of Indemnitee and of the Company and its other functionaries in connection with those event(s) or transaction(s).
Expenses payable pursuant to this Indemnity Agreement are intended to satisfy the indemnification arrangement exception to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any reimbursement of an Expense constitutes deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A (other than a "tax gross-up payment"), such Expense shall be paid by the end of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which the Expense is incurred, and the amount of such Expenses eligible for reimbursement during any calendar year will not affect the amount of Expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other calendar year. With respect to an Expense that is a "tax gross-up payment" as defined in the Treasury Regulations under Code Section 409A, such tax gross-up payment will be paid to the Indemnitee by the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Indemnitee remits the related taxes to the taxing authority. Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if any payment provided for herein would be subject to additional taxes and interest under Code Section 409A and if Indemnitee's receipt of such payment is not delayed until the Section 409A Payment Date, then such payment will not be provided to Indemnitee (or Indemnitee's estate, if applicable) until the Section 409A Payment Date. The "Section 409A Payment Date" is the earlier of (a) the date of Indemnitee's death or (b) the date that is six months and one day after Indemnitee's "separation from service" as defined in Code Section 409A.
28. Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company and Indemnitee have executed this Agreement as of the date and year first above written.

Date: July 27, 2012
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
July 27, 2012
 Approach Resources Inc. today announced preliminary production, commodity price realizations and capital expenditures for second quarter 2012 and provided a mid-year 2012 reserves update. Highlights include:
Fort Worth, Texas, July 27, 2012
(NASDAQ: AREX)
 
 
 
 
Estimated second quarter 2012 production totaled 702 MBoe (7.7 MBoe/d), compared to 608 MBoe (6.7 MBoe/d) produced in second quarter 2011, a 16% increase. Estimated second quarter 2012 production increased 7%, compared to first quarter 2012 production of 654 MBoe (7.2 MBoe/d). Estimated oil production for second quarter 2012 increased 120% to 230 MBbls, compared to 104 MBbls produced in second quarter 2011, and increased 20% compared to first quarter 2012 oil production of 191 MBbls. Estimated production for second quarter 2012 was 33% oil, 32% NGLs and 35% natural gas, compared to 17% oil, 39% NGLs and 44% natural gas in second quarter 2011.
Preliminary, average realized prices for second quarter 2012, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $83.21 per Bbl of oil, $33.75 per Bbl of NGLs and $2.19 per Mcf of natural gas, compared to $97.89 per Bbl of oil, $51.88 per Bbl of NGLs and $4.16 per Mcf of natural gas for second quarter 2011. Our preliminary, average realized price, including the effect of commodity derivatives, was $43.12 per Boe for second quarter 2012, compared to $48.01 per Boe for second quarter 2011.
Preliminary, unaudited estimates of capital expenditures during second quarter 2012 totaled $70.3 million, and included $65.1 million for exploration and development drilling, $4.6 million for pipeline and infrastructure projects and $600,000 for acreage acquisitions. During second quarter 2012, the Company drilled seven wells and completed 10 wells, including eight of 11 wells that were waiting on completion at March 31, 2012. At June 30, 2012, we had eight wells waiting on completion, of which five have since been completed as producers and one has been completed as a water source well.
Proved Reserves Update
Estimated proved reserves at June 30, 2012, were 83.7 MMBoe, an increase of 9% and 25% over year-end 2011 and mid-year 2011 proved reserves, respectively. Oil proved reserves at June 30, 2012, were 23.5 MMBbls, an increase of 30% and 132% over year-end 2011and mid-year 2011 oil proved reserves, respectively. The Company's proved reserves were 28% oil, 36% NGLs and 36% natural gas at June 30, 2012, compared to 23% oil, 38% NGLs and 39% natural gas at year-end 2011. Reserve growth for the first half of 2012 was driven by the Company's drilling program in Project Pangea targeting the Wolfcamp oil shale and the Wolffork formations.
 
The standardized after-tax measure of discounted future net cash flows (the "Standardized Measure") for our proved reserves at June 30, 2012, was $447.9 million. The pre-tax present value of our proved reserves discounted at 10% ("PV-10"), was estimated at $755.2 million. Proved reserves volumes and PV-10 were prepared using prices of $90.13 per Bbl of oil, $50.07 per Bbl of NGLs and $3.36 per Mcf of natural gas. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Measure" below for our definition of PV-10 and reconciliation to the Standardized Measure.
Management Comment
Approach's President and CEO, J. Ross Craft, commented, "Our oil production surged in the second quarter to its highest level in our history, jumping 120% year-over-year as a result of our horizontal development drilling in the Wolfcamp oil shale. Oil and NGLs now represent 65% of our production mix and 64% of our reserve mix, which is a dramatic turnaround from just three years ago, when our primary product was natural gas. Beginning in the second half of the year, we expect to realize the benefit of adding a second horizontal rig in the southern Midland Basin."

All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this press release that address activities, events or developments that the Company expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, forward-looking statements contained in this press release specifically include expectations of anticipated financial and operating results of the Company, including production, realized prices and capital expenditures. These statements are based on certain assumptions made by the Company based on management's experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, anticipated future developments and other factors believed to be appropriate. Such statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. Further information on such assumptions, risks and uncertainties is available in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filings.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Measure
This release contains a financial measure that is a non-GAAP measure. We have provided the reconciliation below of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and on the Non-GAAP Financial Information page in the Investor Relations section of our website at . 
www.approachresources.com
PV-10
The present value of our proved reserves, discounted at 10% ("PV-10"), was estimated at $755.2 million at June 30, 2012, and was calculated based on the first-of-the-month, 12-month average prices for oil, NGLs and gas, of $90.13 per Bbl of oil, $50.07 per Bbl of NGLs and $3.36 per Mcf of natural gas, respectively.
PV-10 is our estimate of the present value of future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves after deducting estimated production and ad valorem taxes, future capital costs and operating expenses, but before deducting any estimates of future income taxes. The estimated future net revenues are discounted at an annual rate of 10% to determine their "present value." We believe PV-10 to be an important measure for evaluating the relative significance of our oil and gas properties and that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure of PV-10 provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and investors in evaluating oil and gas companies. Because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid, we believe the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable for evaluating the Company. We believe that PV-10 is a financial measure routinely used and calculated similarly by other companies in the oil and gas industry.
The following table reconciles PV-10 to our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. PV-10 should not be considered as an alternative to the standardized measure as computed under GAAP.

Date: August 3, 2012
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 Approach Resources Inc. today reported results for second quarter 2012. Highlights for second quarter 2012 include:
Fort Worth, Texas, August 2, 2012
(NASDAQ: AREX)
 
 
 
 
Second Quarter 2012 Financial Results
Second quarter 2012 production totaled 702 MBoe (7.7 MBoe/d), compared to 608 MBoe (6.7 MBoe/d) produced in second quarter 2011, a 16% increase. Estimated second quarter 2012 production increased 7%, compared to first quarter 2012 production of 654 MBoe (7.2 MBoe/d). Oil production for second quarter 2012 increased 120% to 230 MBbls, compared to 104 MBbls produced in second quarter 2011, and increased 20% compared to first quarter 2012 oil production of 191 MBbls. Second quarter 2012 production was 33% oil, 32% NGLs and 35% natural gas, compared to 17% oil, 39% NGLs and 44% natural gas in second quarter 2011.
Net income for second quarter 2012 was $7.9 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, on revenues of $29.9 million. This compares to net income for second quarter 2011 of $8 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, on revenues of $29.1 million. Net income for second quarter 2012 included an unrealized gain on commodity derivatives of $9.4 million and a realized gain on commodity derivatives of $361,000. The decline in net income and net income per diluted share was driven by lower commodity price realizations and higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher production.
Excluding the unrealized gain on commodity derivatives and related income taxes, adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for second quarter 2012 was $1.6 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to $6.5 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, for second quarter 2011. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income.
EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for second quarter 2012 was $20.1 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, compared to $21 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, for second quarter 2011. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of EBITDAX to net income.
Average realized prices for second quarter 2012, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $83.21 per Bbl of oil, $33.75 per Bbl of NGLs and $2.19 per Mcf of natural gas, compared to $97.89 per Bbl of oil, $51.88 per Bbl of NGLs and $4.16 per Mcf of natural gas for second quarter 2011. Our average realized price, including the effect of commodity derivatives, was $43.12 per Boe for second quarter 2012, down 10% compared to $48.01 per Boe for second quarter 2011.
 
Lease operating expenses trended higher in second quarter 2012 compared to second quarter 2011 due to higher production volumes and oil-weighted growth. Severance and production taxes decreased due to our increase in oil sales as a percentage of total oil, NGL and gas sales, as oil sales are taxed at a lower rate. General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher salaries and benefits resulting from increased staffing, partially offset by a decrease in share-based compensation. Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to higher production and increased investment in our oil-focused, Wolfcamp Shale play, relative to estimated proved developed reserves.
Operations Update
During second quarter 2012, the Company drilled seven wells and completed 10 wells, including eight of 11 wells that were waiting on completion at March 31, 2012. At June 30, 2012, we had eight wells waiting on completion, of which five have since been completed as producers and one has been completed as a water source well. We also recompleted 14 wells during the second quarter of 2012. We currently have two horizontal rigs and one vertical rig working.
In Project Pangea, the University 45 A 703H was completed with 29 stages. The University 45 A 703H targeted the Wolfcamp "B" zone and flowed at maximum 24-hour rate of 875 Boe/d, made up of 743 barrels of oil per day (Bo/d), 73 barrels of NGLs per day and 354 Mcf of natural gas per day (Mcf/d). The University 45 A 703H well has produced at an average 30-day rate of 612 Boe/d, made up of 453 Bo/d, 88 barrels of NGLs per day and 428 Mcf/d. The Company also drilled the University 45 B 2402H and University 45 B 2403H in the Wolfcamp "B" zone. Both wells were recently completed and are in the early stages of flowing back fracture stimulation fluids.
In Pangea West, we tested the Wolfcamp "A" zone with two pilot wells, the Pangea West 6602H and the Pangea West 6601H. These wells were completed with 28 and 29 stages, respectively. The Pangea West 6602H flowed at an initial maximum 24-hour rate of 494 Boe/d, made up of 391 Bo/d, 57 barrels of NGLs per day and 278 Mcf/d. The Pangea West 6601H flowed at an initial maximum 24-hour rate of 461 Boe/d, made up of 388 Bo/d, 40 barrels of NGLs per day and 196 Mcf/d. Both wells are in the early stages of flowing back fracture stimulation fluids, and the daily production rate of each well continues to climb. The Company is encouraged by the production data from the first two pilot wells targeting the Wolfcamp "A" zone and plans to test the "A" zone in Project Pangea during the third quarter of 2012. The Company also plans to test central Project Pangea and northeast Project Pangea with horizontal wells during the third and fourth quarters of 2012.
Management Comment
J. Ross Craft, Approach's President and CEO, said, "Our continued focus on the oil-rich Wolfcamp play drove production to the highest level in our Company's history. Significantly, our oil production rose 120% compared to the prior-year period as we continue to shift our product mix from natural gas to oil and liquids. Looking ahead, we have many exciting plans for the second half of the year and beyond. We are pleased to have entered into development drilling in the "B" bench of the Wolfcamp, and we're encouraged by our initial pilot wells targeting the "A" bench. The Company has plans to drill another test well to the "A" zone in Project Pangea during the third quarter of 2012. In addition, we are working on infrastructure plans that we anticipate will lower our trucking differential costs, as well as water sourcing plans. We expect to begin to realize the impact of adding a second rig in the Wolfcamp during the second half of the year, and believe that we are on track to continue to deliver strong production growth for 2012."
 
Liquidity and Commodity Derivatives Update
At June 30, 2012, we had a $300 million revolving credit agreement with a $270 million borrowing base and $145.4 million outstanding. At June 30, 2012, our liquidity and long-term debt-to-capital ratio were $124.7 million and 23.2%, respectively. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our calculation of "liquidity" and "long-term debt-to-capital ratio."
We enter into commodity derivatives positions to reduce the risk of commodity price fluctuations. Please refer to the "Unaudited Commodity Derivatives Information" table below for a detailed summary of the Company's current derivatives positions.
Capital Expenditures and Guidance Update
Costs incurred during second quarter 2012 totaled $70.3 million, and included $65.1 million for exploration and development drilling, $4.6 million for infrastructure projects and $600,000 for acreage acquisitions. The table below sets forth the Company's current production and operating costs and expenses guidance for 2012. The guidance is forward-looking information that is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures
This release contains certain financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. We have provided reconciliations below of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and on the Non-GAAP Financial Information page in the Investor Relations section of our website at . 
www.approachresources.com
Adjusted Net Income
This release contains the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, which excludes (1) unrealized gain on commodity derivatives, (2) gain on sale of oil and gas properties, and (3) related income taxes. The amounts included in the calculation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share below were computed in accordance with GAAP. We believe adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are useful to investors because they provide readers with a more meaningful measure of our profitability before recording certain items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably determined. However, these measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website. The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands, except per-share amounts).
 
 
EBITDAX
We define EBITDAX as net income, plus (1) exploration expense, (2) depletion, depreciation and amortization expense, (3) share-based compensation expense, (4) unrealized gain on commodity derivatives, (5) gain on sale of oil and gas properties, (6) interest expense, and (7) income taxes. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flow as determined by GAAP. The amounts included in the calculation of EBITDAX were computed in accordance with GAAP. EBITDAX is presented herein and reconciled to the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund development and exploration activities. This measure is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website. The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDAX to net income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively (in thousands, except per-share amounts).
 
 
Liquidity
Liquidity is calculated by adding the net funds available under our revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents. We use liquidity as an indicator of the Company's ability to fund development and exploration activities. However, this measurement has limitations. This measurement can vary from year-to-year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the measurement on a company's financial statements. This measurement is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website. The table below summarizes our liquidity at June 30, 2012 (in thousands).
 
Long-Term Debt-to-Capital
Long-term debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as of June 30, 2012, and by dividing long-term debt (GAAP) by the sum of total stockholders' equity (GAAP) and long-term debt (GAAP). We use the long-term debt-to-capital ratio as a measurement of our overall financial leverage. However, this ratio has limitations. This ratio can vary from year-to-year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the ratio on a company's financial statements. This ratio is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website. The table below summarizes our long-term debt-to-capital ratio at June 30, 2012, and December 31, 2011 (in thousands).

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We consent to the use of the name DeGolyer and MacNaughton and to the inclusion of our third-party letter report dated July 6, 2012, containing our opinion on the proved reserves attributable to certain properties owned by Approach Resources Inc. (Approach) as of June 30, 2012, in the Form 8-K to be filed on or about September 18, 2012, including any amendments thereto.
We hereby further consent to the incorporation by reference in Registration Statement (No. 333-174318) on Form S-3, Registration Statement (No. 333-148951) on Form S-8 and Registration Statement (No. 333-183069) on Form S-8 of Approach of the name DeGolyer and MacNaughton and such letter report with respect to the oil and gas reserves of Approach.
 

Exhibit 99.1
Approach Resources, Inc.
6500 West Freeway
Suite 800
Fort Worth, TX 76116
Gentlemen:
Pursuant to your request, we have estimated the net proved crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids (NGL), and natural gas reserves, as of June 30, 2012, of certain properties owned by Approach Resources, Inc. (Approach). This evaluation was completed on July 6, 2012. The properties appraised are located in Limestone, Crockett, and Schleicher Counties, Texas. Approach has represented that these properties account for 100 percent of Approach's net proved reserves as of June 30, 2012. The net proved reserves estimates prepared by us have been prepared in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rules 410(a) (1)(32) of Regulation SX of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States. This report was prepared in accordance with guidelines specified in Item 1202 (a)(8) of Regulation S-K and is to be used for inclusion in certain SEC filings by Approach.
Reserves included herein are expressed as net reserves. Gross reserves are defined as the total estimated petroleum to be produced from these properties after June 30, 2012. Net reserves are defined as that portion of the gross reserves attributable to the interests owned by Approach after deducting all interests owned by others. Gas quantities estimated herein are expressed as sales gas. Sales gas is defined as that portion of the total gas to be delivered into a gas pipeline for sale after separation, processing, fuel use, and flare. Gas reserves are expressed at a temperature base of 60 degrees Fahrenheit (F) and at a pressure base of 14.65 pounds per square inch absolute (psia). Condensate reserves estimated herein are those to be recovered by conventional lease separation. NGL reserves are those attributed to the appraised interests based on processing agreements.
DeGolyer and MacNaughton
 
Estimates of oil, condensate, NGL, and natural gas should be regarded only as estimates that may change as further production history and additional information become available. Not only are such reserves estimates based on that information which is currently available, but such estimates are also subject to the uncertainties inherent in the application of judgmental factors in interpreting such information.
Data used in this evaluation were obtained from reviews with Approach personnel, Approach files, from records on file with the appropriate regulatory agencies, and from public sources. In the preparation of this report we have relied, without independent verification, upon such information furnished by Approach with respect to property interests, production from such properties, current costs of operation and development, current prices for production, agreements relating to current and future operations and sale of production, and various other information and data that were accepted as represented. A field examination of the properties was not considered necessary for the purposes of this report.
Methodology and Procedures
Estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques that are in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled "Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (Revision as of February 19, 2007)." The method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir was tempered by experience with similar reservoirs, stage of development, quality and completeness of basic data, and production history.
When applicable, the volumetric method was used to estimate the original oil in place (OOIP) and the original gas in place (OGIP). Structure and isopach maps were constructed to estimate reservoir volume. Electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, and other available data were used to prepare these maps as well as to estimate representative values for porosity and water saturation. When adequate data were available and when circumstances justified, material balance and other engineering methods were used to estimate OOIP or OGIP.
 
DeGolyer and MacNaughton
 
Estimates of ultimate recovery were obtained after applying recovery factors to OOIP or OGIP. These recovery factors were based on consideration of the type of energy inherent in the reservoirs, analyses of the petroleum, the structural positions of the properties, and the production histories. When applicable, material balance and other engineering methods were used to estimate recovery factors. An analysis of reservoir performance, including production rate, reservoir pressure, and gas-oil ratio behavior, was used in the estimation of reserves.
For depletion-type reservoirs or those whose performance disclosed a reliable decline in producing-rate trends or other diagnostic characteristics, reserves were estimated by the application of appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships. In the analyses of production-decline curves, reserves were estimated only to the limits of economic production.
Definition of Reserves
Petroleum reserves estimated by us included in this report are classified by degree of proof as proved and are judged to be economically producible in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions and assuming continuation of current regulatory practices using conventional production methods and equipment. In the analyses of production-decline curves, reserves were estimated only to the limit of economic rates of production under existing economic and operating conditions using prices and costs consistent with the effective date of this report, including consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements but not including escalations based upon future conditions. Proved reserves classifications used by us in this report are in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rules 410(a) (1)(32) of Regulation SX of the SEC. The petroleum reserves are classified as follows:
 Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically produciblefrom a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulationsprior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
Proved oil and gas reserves
 
DeGolyer and MacNaughton
 
(i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes: (A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and (B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.
(ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
(iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.
(iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when:
(A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based; and (B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.
 
DeGolyer and MacNaughton
 
(v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.
 Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:
Developed oil and gas reserves
(i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and
(ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.
Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
Undeveloped oil and gas reserves 
(i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.
(ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time.
 
DeGolyer and MacNaughton
 
(iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in [section 210.410 (a) Definitions], or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.
Primary Economic Assumptions
The following economic assumptions were used for estimating existing and future prices and costs:
Oil Prices
Prices used in this evaluation were based on local differentials to the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price of $97.77 per barrel. The WTI base price is the average price for WTI crude on the first day of the month for the period July 1, 2011, through June 1, 2012. Local differentials are based on the difference between the actual price received and the WTI price on the first day of each month between July 1, 2011, and June 1, 2012. The weighted average price over the lives of the properties was $90.13 per barrel.
Natural Gas Prices
Prices used in this evaluation were based on local differentials to a Henry Hub gas price of $3.525 per million British thermal units (MMBtu). The Henry Hub base price is the average price for Henry Hub gas on the first day of each month for the period July 1, 2011, through June 1, 2012. Local differentials are based on the difference between the actual price received and the Henry Hub price on the first day of each month between July 1, 2011, through June 1, 2012. The weighted average price over the lives of the properties was $3.355 per thousand cubic feet.
 
DeGolyer and MacNaughton
 
For the Angus and Ozona areas, contractual arrangements for gas sales have been taken into account in the preparation of this report. As of June 30, 2012, gas in the Angus and West Pangea areas is sold at a differential to Henry Hub of -$0.179 per MMBtu. Gas from the Ozona area, as of June 30, 2012 is being sold at a differential of $0.159 per MMBtu. Gas from the Bald Prairie area, as of June 30, 2012 is being sold at a differential of -$0.411 per MMBtu.
NGL Prices
Prices used in this evaluation were based on the average price received on the first day of each month for the period July 1, 2011, through June 1, 2012. The weighted average price, held constant over the lives of the properties, was $50.07 per barrel.
Operating Expenses and Capital Costs
Estimates of operating expenses based on current expenses were used for the lives of the properties with no increases in the future based on inflation. In certain cases, future expenses, either higher or lower than current expenses, may have been used because of anticipated changes in operating conditions. Future capital expenditures were estimated using 2012 values and were not adjusted for inflation.
While the oil and gas industry may be subject to regulatory changes from time to time that could affect an industry participant's ability to recover its oil and gas reserves, we are not aware of any such governmental actions which would restrict the recovery of the June 30, 2012, estimated oil and gas volumes. The reserves estimated in this report can be produced under current regulatory guidelines.
 
DeGolyer and MacNaughton
 
Summary of Oil and Gas Reserves
Our estimates of the net proved reserves attributable to the properties appraised, as of June 30, 2012, are summarized by geographic area as follows, expressed in thousands of barrels (Mbbl), millions of cubic feet (MMcf):
 
In our opinion, the information relating to estimated proved reserves of oil, condensate, natural gas liquids, and gas contained in this report has been prepared in accordance with Paragraphs 932-235-50-4, 932-235-50-6, 932-235-50-7, and 932-235-50-9 of the Accounting Standards Update 932-235-50, (January 2010) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and Rules 410(a) (1)(32) of Regulation SX and Rules 302(b), 1201, 1202(a) (1), (2), (3), (4), (8), and 1203(a) of Regulation SK of the Securities and Exchange Commission; provided, however, that estimates of proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves are not presented at the beginning of the year.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On September 19, 2012, Approach Resources Inc. (the "Company") entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement"), with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as representative (the "Representative") for the underwriters party thereto (including the Representative, the "Underwriters"), to issue and sell to the Underwriters an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of common stock (the "Firm Shares"). Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Company also granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 750,000 shares of common stock (collectively with the Firm Shares, the "Shares"). The issuance and sale of the Shares have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") pursuant to an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR (Registration No. 333-174318) of the Company, and the prospectus supplement dated September 19, 2012, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 20, 2012. The Company intends to use the proceeds from this offering primarily to fund its capital expenditures for the development of its Wolfcamp oil shale resource play and for general working capital needs. Pending such uses, the Company intends to repay outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility, which amount may be re-borrowed in accordance with the terms of the facility. Closing of the issuance and sale of the Shares is scheduled for September 25, 2012. A legal opinion related to the Shares is filed herewith as Exhibit 5.1.
The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements by the Company and customary conditions to closing, obligations of the parties and termination provisions. Additionally, the Company has agreed with the Underwriters not to offer or sell any shares of its common stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock), subject to certain exceptions, for a period of 90 days after the date of the Underwriting Agreement without the prior written consent of the Representative.
Certain of the Underwriters and their respective affiliates have performed, and may in the future perform, certain commercial banking, financial advisory, investment banking and other services for the Company, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. Affiliates of certain of the Underwriters are lenders under the Company's revolving credit facility, and, in such capacity, will receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering.
A copy of the Underwriting Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The description of the Underwriting Agreement in this Current Report on Form 8-K is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Underwriting Agreement.

(c) . If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to Sections 7(a) or 7(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under Sections 7(a) or 7(b) hereof except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under Sections 7(a) or 7(b) hereof. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary or (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be paid or reimbursed as they are incurred.

The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written

consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this Section 7(c), the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) . If the indemnification provided for in Sections 7(a) and 7(b) hereof is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such section, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Shares and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Shares. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriter, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution
 
(e) . The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 7(d) hereof. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 7(d) hereof shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Shares exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability
pro rata
(f) . The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies
8. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness of Agreement
9. . This Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Representative, by notice to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date or, in the case of the Option Shares, prior to the Additional Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Global Market, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade; (ii) trading of any securities issued or guaranteed by the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities; or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in the judgment of the Representative, is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Shares on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
Termination
10. .
Defaulting Underwriter
(a) If, on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Shares that it has agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Shares by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any
 
Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Shares, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Shares on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes.

(b) the Time of Sale Information, as of 5:00 p.m. eastern time on September 19, 2012 contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or

that we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus Supplement or the Time of Sale Information (except as otherwise specifically stated in paragraphs 8 and 9), and we do not express any belief with respect to, the financial statements, related notes or schedules or other financial data, accounting data or information or assessments of or reports on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; oil and gas reserves data; or statistical or accounting data derived from such financial and oil and gas reserves data contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus Supplement.

Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
October 29, 2012
 Approach Resources Inc. today announced preliminary production, commodity prices and capital expenditures for third quarter 2012. Highlights compared to prior-year period include:
Fort Worth, Texas, October 29, 2012
(NASDAQ: AREX)
 
 
Third Quarter 2012 Production
Estimated third quarter 2012 production totaled 747 MBoe (8.1 MBoe/d), compared to 612 MBoe (6.7 MBoe/d) produced in third quarter 2011, a 22% increase. Estimated third quarter 2012 production also increased 7% over second quarter 2012 production of 702 MBoe (7.7 MBoe/d). Estimated oil production for third quarter 2012 increased 113% to 250 MBbls, compared to 117 MBbls produced in third quarter 2011. Estimated production for third quarter 2012 was 34% oil, 31% NGLs and 35% natural gas, compared to 19% oil, 38% NGLs and 43% natural gas in third quarter 2011.
Production from north Project Pangea in the Wolfcamp oil shale resource play was impacted by downtime at a third-party natural gas processing facility during third quarter 2012. We estimate that the impact to third quarter 2012 production as a result of plant downtime totaled approximately 340 Boe/d. We expect that intermittent downtime may continue through mid-November 2012.
We have begun construction on a new, 5.5 mile, 8-inch high-pressure natural gas line to deliver our natural gas production from north Project Pangea to a gas processing facility in Ozona, Texas ("Ozona Plant") with improved economics and higher capacity than the current, third-party facility for our north Project Pangea natural gas. We expect the new gas line to be operational by the second week of November 2012. In addition, we are beginning construction of a second new, 3.1 mile, 8-inch high-pressure natural gas line in Block 45 of Project Pangea to transport gas to the Ozona Plant. We anticipate completion of this line by the third week of November 2012. Once these lines are completed, 100% of our natural gas will be delivered to the Ozona Plant.
Due to the unanticipated plant downtime, and subject to timely completion of our new gas lines, we expect full-year 2012 production to be 2,800 MBoe  3,000 MBoe.
Third Quarter 2012 Commodity Prices
Preliminary, average realized prices for third quarter 2012, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $86.38 per Bbl of oil, $30.50 per Bbl of NGLs and $2.73 per Mcf of natural gas, compared to $81.51 per Bbl of oil, $52.08 per Bbl of NGLs and $3.99 per Mcf of natural gas for third quarter 2011. Our preliminary, average realized price, including the effect of commodity derivatives, was $44.78 per Boe for third quarter 2012, compared to $47.98 per Boe for third quarter 2011.
 
Third Quarter 2012 Capital Expenditures
Preliminary, unaudited estimates of capital expenditures during third quarter 2012 totaled $77.1 million, and included $60.3 million for drilling and completions, $11.7 million for pipeline and infrastructure projects, $4.4 million for acreage acquisitions and $0.7 million for 3-D seismic data acquisition. During third quarter 2012, the Company drilled 12 wells and completed 10 wells, including five of eight wells that were waiting on completion at June 30, 2012. At September 30, 2012, we had eight wells waiting on completion.

Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
November 5, 2012
 Approach Resources Inc. today reported results for third quarter 2012. Highlights for third quarter 2012 include:
Fort Worth, Texas, November 5, 2012
(NASDAQ: AREX)
 
 
 
 
 
 
Third quarter 2012 production totaled 747 MBoe (8.1 MBoe/d), compared to 612 MBoe (6.7 MBoe/d) produced in third quarter 2011, a 22% increase. Third quarter 2012 production also increased 7% over second quarter 2012 production of 702 MBoe (7.7 MBoe/d). Oil production for third quarter 2012 increased 113% to 250 MBbls, compared to 117 MBbls produced in third quarter 2011. Production for third quarter 2012 was 34% oil, 31% NGLs and 35% natural gas, compared to 19% oil, 38% NGLs and 43% natural gas in third quarter 2011. As previously reported, production from north Project Pangea in the Wolfcamp oil shale resource play was impacted by downtime at a third-party natural gas processing facility during third quarter 2012. We estimate that the impact to third quarter 2012 production as a result of plant downtime totaled approximately 340 Boe/d. Also as previously disclosed, we are constructing two high-pressure gas lines from north Project Pangea to deliver our natural gas to a processing facility in Ozona, Texas, with better economics and more capacity than the current, third-party facility for our north Project Pangea natural gas. We expect the new gas lines to be operational by the second and third weeks of November 2012, respectively.
Third Quarter 2012 Financial Results
Net loss for third quarter 2012 was $2.4 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, on revenues of $33.0 million. This compares to net income for third quarter 2011 of $7.1 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, on revenues of $28.0 million. The $5.1 million increase in revenues in third quarter 2012 was attributable to an increase in production volumes ($11.5 million), which was offset by a decrease in oil, NGL and gas prices ($6.4 million). Net loss for third quarter 2012 included an unrealized loss on commodity derivatives of $4.2 million and a realized gain on commodity derivatives of $423,000. The decline in net income was driven by higher operating expenses and an unrealized loss on commodity derivatives, which were partially offset by higher revenues for third quarter 2012.
Excluding the unrealized loss on commodity derivatives and related income tax effect, adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for third quarter 2012 was $407,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to $5.9 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, for third quarter 2011. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of adjusted net income to net (loss) income.
 
EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for third quarter 2012 was $21.5 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, compared to $21.7 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, for third quarter 2011. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of EBITDAX to net (loss) income.
Average realized prices for third quarter 2012, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $86.38 per Bbl of oil, $30.50 per Bbl of NGLs and $2.73 per Mcf of natural gas, compared to $81.51 per Bbl of oil, $52.08 per Bbl of NGLs and $3.99 per Mcf of natural gas for third quarter 2011. Our average realized price, including the effect of commodity derivatives, was $44.78 per Boe for third quarter 2012, down 7% compared to $47.98 per Boe for third quarter 2011.
Lease operating expenses increased in third quarter 2012 compared to third quarter 2011 primarily due to higher compressor rental and repair, well repair and maintenance, pumpers and supervision as well as water hauling and insurance. Severance and production taxes increased due to our increase in oil, NGL and gas sales. General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher salaries, benefits and share-based compensation resulting from increased staffing. Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to higher production and oil and gas property carrying costs, relative to estimated proved developed reserves. Higher oil and gas property carrying costs primarily reflect our development of our oil-focused, Wolfcamp shale play.
Operations Update
During third quarter 2012, the Company drilled 12 wells and completed 10 wells, including five of eight wells that were waiting on completion at June 30, 2012. At September 30, 2012, we had eight wells waiting on completion. We currently have two horizontal rigs and one vertical rig working. Results for recent horizontal Wolfcamp wells are provided below:
 
 
 
 
We also recently completed the University 45 G 2217H (8,053 feet lateral) and University 45 G 2216H (8,049 feet lateral). Each well targeted the Wolfcamp B bench and was completed with 30 stages. The 2217H is flowing 627 Boe/d, made up of 84% oil, with approximately 8% fluid recovery and production climbing daily. The 2216H is in the very early stages of flowing back fracture stimulation fluids, and we expect to see peak oil production within the next two weeks.
 
Liquidity and Commodity Derivatives Update
At September 30, 2012, we had a $300.0 million revolving credit agreement with a $270.0 million borrowing base and $47.6 million outstanding. At September 30, 2012, our liquidity and long-term debt-to-capital ratio were $222.9 million and 7.1%, respectively. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our calculation of "liquidity" and "long-term debt-to-capital ratio."
On September 19, 2012, we completed a public offering of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock at $30.50 per share. Subsequent to September 30, 2012, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 325,000 shares of our common stock. After deducting underwriting discounts and transaction costs of approximately $8 million, we received net proceeds of approximately $154.4 million, of which $145.0 million was received prior to September 30, 2012. We intend to use the proceeds to fund our capital expenditures for the Wolfcamp oil shale resource play and general working capital needs. Pending these uses, we used the proceeds of the 2012 equity offering to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
Effective October 11, 2012, the lenders in our credit facility increased the borrowing base under the credit agreement to $280.0 million from $270.0 million.
We enter into commodity derivatives positions to reduce the risk of commodity price fluctuations. Please refer to the "Unaudited Commodity Derivatives Information" table below for a detailed summary of the Company's current derivatives positions.
Capital Expenditures and Guidance Update
Capital expenditures during third quarter 2012 totaled $77.1 million, and included $60.3 million for drilling and completions, $11.7 million for pipeline and infrastructure projects, $4.4 million for acreage acquisitions and $0.7 million for 3-D seismic data acquisition. We have increased our estimated 2012 capital budget to $295.0 million. The $35.0 million increase in capital expenditures is made up of $16.6 million for pipeline and infrastructure projects, $12.2 million for drilling and completions, $5.0 million for acreage acquisitions and $1.2 million for 3-D seismic data acquisition. The table below sets forth the Company's current production and operating costs and expenses guidance for 2012. The guidance is forward-looking information that is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control.
 
 
In September 2012, we announced that we plan to add a third horizontal rig to our drilling program in January 2013 to accelerate the development of our Wolfcamp oil shale play. Our preliminary 2013 capital expenditure budget is $260.0 million and includes operating three horizontal rigs and one vertical rig to drill approximately 35 to 40 horizontal wells and 12 vertical wells, respectively. We also plan to recomplete 10 wells in the Wolfcamp and Clearfork zones in 2013. The preliminary 2013 capital budget excludes acquisitions. We expect to provide 2013 production and operating costs and expenses guidance in January 2013.
Our 2012 and 2013 capital budgets are subject to change depending upon a number of factors, including additional data on the Company's Wolfcamp oil shale resource play, results of horizontal and vertical drilling and recompletions, economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil, NGLs and gas, the availability of sufficient capital resources for drilling prospects, the Company's financial results and the availability of lease extensions and renewals on reasonable terms.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures
This release contains certain financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. We have provided reconciliations below of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and on the Non-GAAP Financial Information page in the Investor Relations section of our website at . 
www.approachresources.com
Adjusted Net Income
This release contains the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, which excludes (1) unrealized loss (gain) on commodity derivatives, (2) gain on sale of oil and gas properties, and (3) related income tax effect. The amounts included in the calculation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share below were computed in accordance with GAAP. We believe adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are useful to investors because they provide readers with a more meaningful measure of our profitability before recording certain items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably determined. However, these measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted net income to net (loss) income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands, except per-share amounts).
 
 
EBITDAX
We define EBITDAX as net (loss) income, plus (1) exploration expense, (2) depletion, depreciation and amortization expense, (3) share-based compensation expense, (4) unrealized loss (gain) on commodity derivatives, (5) gain on sale of oil and gas properties, (6) interest expense, and (7) income taxes. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flow as determined by GAAP. The amounts included in the calculation of EBITDAX were computed in accordance with GAAP. EBITDAX is presented herein and reconciled to the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund development and exploration activities. This measure is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDAX to net (loss) income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively (in thousands, except per-share amounts).
 
 
Liquidity
Liquidity is calculated by adding the net funds available under our revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents. We use liquidity as an indicator of the Company's ability to fund development and exploration activities. However, this measurement has limitations. This measurement can vary from year-to-year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the measurement on a company's financial statements. This measurement is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
The table below summarizes our liquidity at September 30, 2012, and our liquidity at September 30, 2012, reflecting the October 2012 borrowing base increase to $280.0 million from $270.0 million.
 
Long-Term Debt-to-Capital
Long-term debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as of September 30, 2012, and by dividing long-term debt (GAAP) by the sum of total stockholders' equity (GAAP) and long-term debt (GAAP). We use the long-term debt-to-capital ratio as a measurement of our overall financial leverage. However, this ratio has limitations. This ratio can vary from year-to-year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the ratio on a company's financial statements. This ratio is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
The table below summarizes our long-term debt-to-capital ratio at September 30, 2012, and December 31, 2011 (in thousands).

Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
February 13, 2013
 Approach Resources Inc. today reported estimated production for full year and fourth quarter 2012 and provided an operations update and 2013 outlook. Highlights compared to the prior-year period include:
Fort Worth, Texas, February 13, 2013
(NASDAQ: AREX)
 
 
 
 
Estimated Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2012 Production
Estimated 2012 production totaled 2,888 MBoe (7.9 MBoe/d), up 24% from 2011. Oil production for 2012 increased 101% compared to 2011. Estimated production for 2012 was of 34% oil, 31% NGLs and 35% natural gas, compared to 21% oil, 34% NGLs and 45% natural gas in 2011.
Estimated fourth quarter 2012 production totaled 784 MBoe (8.5 MBoe/d), up 21% from the same period in 2011 and 5% from the prior quarter. Estimated oil production for fourth quarter 2012 increased 75% compared to fourth quarter 2011 and 20% from the prior quarter. Estimated production for fourth quarter 2012 was 38% oil, 30% NGLs and 32% natural gas, compared to 26% oil, 35% NGLs and 39% natural gas in fourth quarter 2011.
Preliminary, average realized prices for fourth quarter 2012, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $78.27 per Bbl of oil, $30.27 per Bbl of NGLs and $3.22 per Mcf of natural gas, compared to $85.56 per Bbl of oil, $51.71 per Bbl of NGLs and $3.19 per Mcf of natural gas for fourth quarter 2011. Our preliminary, average realized price, including the effect of commodity derivatives, was $44.50 per Boe for fourth quarter 2012, compared to $50.63 per Boe for fourth quarter 2011.
Operations Update
During fourth quarter 2012, the Company drilled 12 wells and completed 10 wells. During 2012, the Company drilled a total of 46 wells and completed 52 wells. At December 31, 2012, we had 10 wells waiting on completion.
We currently are running three horizontal rigs in the Wolfcamp play. The Company recently completed seven horizontal wells targeting the Wolfcamp B bench. The average initial producing rate for these seven wells was 900 Boe/d, made up of 79% oil. Of note, the University 45 G 2216H well (8,049 feet lateral) was completed with 30 stages and flowed at an initial 24-hour rate of 1,042 Boe/d, made up of 80% oil. Also, the Baker B 207H (7,380 feet lateral) was completed with 27 stages and flowed at an initial 24-hour rate of 1,003 Boe/d, made up of 74% oil.
 
The Company recently reached total depth on the University 45 A 706H and the University 45 A 708H wells, targeting the Wolfcamp A bench and Wolfcamp B bench, respectively. The 706H and 708H wells are part of the Company's initial, six-well program to test a "stacked" lateral development plan that includes drilling both wells from the same pad location. This pilot program is an important step in the Company's efforts to transition all three benches, the Wolfcamp A, B and C, to development stage and improve operating efficiencies as well as hydrocarbon recoveries.
The Company currently trucks oil production to Midland, Texas. Due to the widening of the regional Midland/Cushing differential, the Company estimates that its first quarter 2013 differential will range from $13/Bbl of oil to $15/Bbl of oil. This estimate represents the regional differential and transportation fees. Beginning in April 2013, the Company expects to start flowing oil by pipeline to a facility in Reagan County, Texas. We expect transporting our oil production by pipeline and planned regional pipeline projects will significantly reduce our oil differential for the remainder of 2013.
2013 Production and Expense Guidance
We estimate 2013 production to be 3,600 to 3,900 MBoe, with first quarter 2013 production ranging from 8.9 MBoe/d to 9.1 MBoe/d. Our horizontal drilling and development program in 2013 includes pad development. This approach is anticipated to improve operating efficiencies and resource recoveries while reducing facilities costs and surface impact. As a result of pad drilling, completing multiple wells at one time, or "batch completions," and shutting in adjacent producing wells during completions, we expect a "stair-step" production growth profile for 2013. Pad drilling could also increase our estimates of 2013 capital expenditures and production if the total number of days to drill and complete wells decreases significantly.
The table below sets forth the Company's current production and operating costs and expenses guidance for 2013.
 
The Company's guidance is forward-looking information that is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control. In addition, our 2013 capital budget is subject to change depending upon a number of factors, including additional data on the Company's Wolfcamp oil shale resource play, results of horizontal and vertical drilling, completions and recompletions, including pad drilling and batch completions, economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil, NGLs and gas, the availability of sufficient capital resources for drilling prospects, the Company's financial results and the availability of lease extensions and renewals on reasonable terms.
 
Commodity Derivatives Update
We enter into commodity derivatives positions to reduce the risk of commodity price fluctuations. For 2013, we have commodity derivatives positions covering 2,300 Bbls/d of oil for February 1, 2013, through December 31, 2013. The table below is a summary of our current derivatives positions.
 
Conference Call Scheduled for February 22, 2013

Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
February 21, 2013
 Approach Resources Inc. today reported results for full year and fourth quarter 2012 and announced estimated 2012 proved reserves. Highlights for 2012, compared to 2011, include:
Fort Worth, Texas, February 21, 2013
(NASDAQ: AREX)
 
 
 
 
 
 
PV-10, reserve replacement ratio and drill-bit F&D cost are non-GAAP measures. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures" below for our definition and reconciliation of PV-10 to the Standardized Measure (GAAP) and our definition and calculation of drill-bit F&D cost and reserve replacement ratio.
J. Ross Craft, Approach's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Growing our proved reserves by 24% in 2012 and doubling our oil reserves highlights the tremendous opportunity we have in the Wolfcamp oil shale resource play. Our reserve replacement of 1,346% was achieved at a competitive drill-bit finding and development cost of $7.45 per Boe. Through our strong horizontal well results and vertical development, we have de-risked approximately 107,000 gross acres in Project Pangea. As a result, we have expanded our count of horizontal Wolfcamp drilling locations 300%, from 500 in 2011 to more than 2,000 currently. Combined, our extensive inventory of horizontal, vertical and recompletion locations represent more than 1 billion Boe of gross, unrisked resource potential, which is more than ten times our current proved reserves and represents multiple decades of drilling inventory. In addition, we have made progress in reaching our target horizontal well cost of $5.5 million. Horizontal well costs during the second half of 2012 averaged approximately $6.4 million per well, and we expect to achieve our target well cost after we complete our infrastructure projects in Block 45 of Project Pangea. We anticipate completing these projects by the end of first quarter 2013. Our inventory of low-risk, high-margin oil reserves is expected to drive the continued success of our company for many years."
2012 Financial Results
Production for 2012 totaled 2,888 MBoe (7.9 MBoe/d), up 24% from 2011. Oil production of 969 MBbls for 2012 increased 101% compared to 2011. Our strong growth in oil production in 2012 was primarily driven by our horizontal drilling and completion activity in the Wolfcamp shale play. Production for 2012 was 34% oil, 31% NGLs and 35% natural gas, compared to 21% oil, 34% NGLs and 45% natural gas in 2011.
 
Net income for 2012 was $6.4 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, on revenues of $128.9 million. This compares to net income for 2011 of $7.2 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, on revenues of $108.4 million. Full year 2012 revenues increased $20.5 million due to an increase in production volumes ($44.2 million), partially offset by a decrease in oil, NGL and gas prices ($23.7 million). Net income for 2012 included an unrealized gain on commodity derivatives of $3.9 million and a realized loss on commodity derivatives of $108,000. The decline in net income was driven by higher expenses and a realized loss on commodity derivatives, which were partially offset by higher revenues and an unrealized gain on commodity derivatives for 2012.
Excluding the unrealized gain on commodity derivatives and related income tax effect, adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for 2012 was $3.8 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, compared to $19.5 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, for 2011. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income.
EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for 2012 was $83.0 million, or $2.37 per diluted share, compared to $79.4 million, or $2.72 per diluted share, for 2011. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of EBITDAX to net income.
Average realized commodity prices for 2012, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $84.70 per Bbl of oil, $34.09 per Bbl of NGLs and $2.63 per Mcf of natural gas, compared to $88.18 per Bbl of oil, $51.39 per Bbl of NGLs and $3.92 per Mcf of natural gas for 2011. Our average realized price, including the effect of commodity derivatives, was $44.60 per Boe for 2012, down 7% compared to $47.81 per Boe for 2011.
Lease operating expenses increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to higher workover, compression, water hauling, well repair and maintenance expenses. Production and ad valorem taxes increased due to our increase in oil, NGL and gas sales. General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher share-based compensation as well as salaries and benefits, a result of increased staffing. Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to higher production and oil and gas property carrying costs, relative to estimated proved developed reserves. Higher oil and gas property carrying costs primarily reflect our development of our oil-focused Wolfcamp shale play.
Fourth Quarter 2012 Financial Results
Fourth quarter 2012 production totaled 784 MBoe (8.5 MBoe/d), up 21% from the same period in 2011 and 5% from the prior quarter. Oil production for fourth quarter 2012 increased 75% compared to fourth quarter 2011 and 20% from the prior quarter. Production for fourth quarter 2012 was 38% oil, 30% NGLs and 32% natural gas, compared to 26% oil, 35% NGLs and 39% natural gas in fourth quarter 2011.
Net loss for fourth quarter 2012 was $837,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, on revenues of $35.3 million. This compares to net loss for fourth quarter 2011 of $9.3 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, on revenues of $31.1 million. Fourth quarter 2012 revenues increased $4.2 million due to an increase in production volumes ($10.2 million), partially offset by a decrease in oil, NGL and gas prices ($6.0 million). Net loss for fourth quarter 2012 included an unrealized gain on commodity derivatives of $1.3 million and a realized loss on commodity derivatives of $408,000.
Excluding the unrealized loss on commodity derivatives and related income tax effect, adjusted net loss (non-GAAP) for fourth quarter 2012 was $1.7 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $5.8 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, for fourth quarter 2011. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of adjusted net income to net (loss) income.
 
 
EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for fourth quarter 2012 was $20.6 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, compared to $22.8 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, for fourth quarter 2011. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of EBITDAX to net (loss) income.
Average realized commodity prices for fourth quarter 2012, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $78.27 per Bbl of oil, $30.27 per Bbl of NGLs and $3.22 per Mcf of natural gas, compared to $85.56 per Bbl of oil, $51.71 per Bbl of NGLs and $3.19 per Mcf of natural gas for fourth quarter 2011. Our average realized price, including the effect of commodity derivatives, was $44.50 per Boe for fourth quarter 2012, down 12% compared to $50.63 per Boe for fourth quarter 2011.
Lease operating expenses increased in fourth quarter 2012 compared to fourth quarter 2011 primarily due to higher workover, compression, water hauling, well repair and maintenance expenses. We expect lease operating expense per Boe to decrease in 2013 due to cost savings from our new infrastructure projects and higher production. Production and ad valorem taxes increased due to our increase in oil, NGL and gas sales. General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher share-based compensation as well as salaries and benefits, a result of increased staffing. Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to higher production and oil and gas property carrying costs, relative to estimated proved developed reserves. Higher oil and gas property carrying costs primarily reflect our development of our oil-focused Wolfcamp shale play.
2012 Estimated Proved Reserves
Year-end 2012 proved reserves totaled 95.5 MMBoe, up 24% from year-end 2011 proved reserves of 77.0 MMBoe. The Company's proved oil reserves increased 106% to 37.3 MMBbls, compared to year-end 2011 proved oil reserves of 18.1 MMBbls. Year-end 2012 proved reserves were 39% oil, 30% NGLs and 31% natural gas and 34% proved developed, compared to 23% oil, 38% NGLs and 39% natural gas and 44% proved developed at year end 2011. At December 31, 2012, 99.9% of our proved reserves were located in our core operating area in the Permian Basin.
The increase in year-end 2012 estimated proved reserves is primarily a result of our horizontal development project in the Wolfcamp oil shale resource play. Year-end 2012 estimated proved reserves included 60.1 MMBoe attributable to the Wolfcamp shale play, compared to 24.2 MMBoe at year-end 2011, representing a 149% increase.
The increase in proved reserves was partially offset by the reclassification of 8.9 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves to probable undeveloped. These reserves are attributable to vertical Canyon locations in southeast Project Pangea. Due to our horizontal Wolfcamp development project, including pad drilling, postponement of these deeper locations beyond five years from initial booking is necessary to integrate their development with the shallower Wolfcamp and Wolffork zones. As a result of lower natural gas and NGL prices during 2012, we also recorded 2.4 MMBoe of price revisions.
 
 
The following table summarizes the changes in our estimated proved reserves during 2012.
 
Our preliminary, unaudited estimate of the standardized after-tax measure of discounted future net cash flows ("Standardized Measure") for our proved reserves at December 31, 2012, was $494.2 million. Estimated PV-10, or pre-tax present value of our proved reserves discounted at 10%, was $830.9 million. The independent engineering firm DeGolyer and MacNaughton prepared our estimates of year-end 2012 proved reserves and PV-10. PV-10 is a non-GAAP measure. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures" below for our definition of PV-10 and a reconciliation to the Standardized Measure (GAAP). Estimates of proved reserves and PV-10 were prepared using $94.71 per Bbl of oil, $37.88 per Bbl of NGLs and $2.74 per MMBtu of natural gas.
Costs Incurred and Equity Investment
Preliminary, unaudited costs incurred during 2012 totaled $297.3 million, consisting of $240.8 million for horizontal and vertical drilling and completion activities and recompletions, $44.3 million for pipeline and infrastructure projects, $9.0 million for acreage acquisitions, and $3.2 million for 3-D seismic data acquisition. Also, as previously disclosed, in September 2012, we entered into a joint venture to build an oil pipeline in Crockett and Reagan Counties, Texas, which will be used to transport our oil to market. In October 2012, we made an initial capital contribution of $10 million to the joint venture for pipeline and facilities construction. Future capital contributions to the venture are discretionary.
Drilling Locations and Resource Potential
The Company made significant progress in the horizontal Wolfcamp shale play during 2012. Based on the Company's results in the horizontal Wolfcamp play, the delineation of the Wolfcamp across approximately 107,000 gross acres, hundreds of vertical well control points and information from 3-D seismic, micro-seismic, core and log data, we have identified 2,096 horizontal locations, including 130 horizontal PUD locations. The Company's horizontal drilling inventory is based on 120-acre spacing and multi-bench development. In the horizontal Wolfcamp shale play, estimated gross, unrisked resource potential increased over 300% to approximately 943 MMBoe gross (707.4 MMBoe net).
The following table summarizes the Company's identified horizontal drilling locations as of December 31, 2012.
 
 
 
Approach also has identified 727 vertical locations, made up of 329 locations targeting the Wolffork and 398 locations targeting the Canyon Wolffork, as well as 160 vertical Wolffork recompletions. Our horizontal and vertical drilling inventory does not include any locations in south Project Pangea.
Liquidity and Commodity Derivatives Update
At December 31, 2012, we had a $300.0 million revolving credit agreement with a $280.0 million borrowing base and $106.0 million outstanding. At December 31, 2012, our liquidity and long-term debt-to-capital ratio were $174.4 million and 14.3%, respectively. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our calculation of "liquidity" and "long-term debt-to-capital ratio."
We enter into commodity derivatives positions to reduce the risk of commodity price fluctuations. We have added to our 2013 commodity derivatives positions with a Midland/Cushing basis differential swap covering 2,300 Bbls/d at a price of $1.10/Bbl from March 2013 through December 2013. We expect this swap will limit our exposure to the Midland/Cushing differential, which has been volatile during fourth quarter 2012 and first quarter 2013. Please refer to the "Unaudited Commodity Derivatives Information" table below for a detailed summary of the Company's current derivatives positions.

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this press release that address activities, events or developments that the Company expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, forward-looking statements contained in this press release specifically include estimated proved reserves, expected drilling locations and resource potential, as well as anticipated financial results of the Company. These statements are based on certain assumptions made by the Company based on management's experience, perception of historical trends and technical analyses, current conditions, anticipated future developments and other factors believed to be appropriate and reasonable by management. When used in this press release, the words "will," "potential," "believe," "estimate," "intend," "expect," "may," "should," "anticipate," "could," "plan," "predict," "project," "profile," "model" or their negatives, other similar expressions or the statements that include those words, are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. Such statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. Further information on such assumptions, risks and uncertainties is available in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filings. The Company's SEC filings are available on the Company's website at www.approachresources.com. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the Company undertakes no obligation to correct or update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.
The SEC permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved, probable and possible reserves that meet the SEC's definitions for such terms, and price and cost sensitivities for such reserves, and prohibits disclosure of resources that do not constitute such reserves. The Company uses the terms "estimated ultimate recovery," "EUR," reserve or resource "potential," "upside" or other descriptions of volumes of reserves potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that the SEC's rules may prohibit the Company from including in filings with the SEC. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of being actually realized by the Company.
Potential drilling locations and resource potential estimates have not been risked by the Company. Actual locations drilled and quantities that may be ultimately recovered from the Company's interest may differ substantially from the Company's estimates. There is no commitment by the Company to drill all of the drilling locations that have been attributed to these quantities. Factors affecting ultimate recovery include the scope of the Company's ongoing drilling program, which will be directly affected by the availability of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling and completion services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, regulatory approval and actual drilling results, as well as geological and mechanical factors. Estimates of unproved reserves, type/decline curves, per well EUR and resource potential may change significantly as development of the Company's oil and gas assets provides additional data.
Information in this release regarding the Standardized Measure and costs incurred is preliminary and unaudited. Final and audited results will be provided in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, to be filed on or before March 1, 2013.
For a glossary of oil and gas terms and abbreviations used in this release, please see our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 12, 2012.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures
This release contains certain financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. We have provided reconciliations below of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and on the Non-GAAP Financial Information page in the Investor Relations section of our website at . 
www.approachresources.com
Adjusted Net Income
This release contains the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, which excludes (1) impairment, (2) unrealized (gain) loss on commodity derivatives, (3) loss (gain) on sale of oil and gas properties, and (4) related income tax effect. The amounts included in the calculation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share below were computed in accordance with GAAP. We believe adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are useful to investors because they provide readers with a more meaningful measure of our profitability before recording certain items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably determined. However, these measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted net (loss) income to net (loss) income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands, except per-share amounts).
 
EBITDAX
We define EBITDAX as net (loss) income, plus (1) exploration expense, (2) impairment, (3) depletion, depreciation and amortization expense, (4) share-based compensation expense, (5) unrealized (gain) loss on commodity derivatives, (6) loss (gain) on sale of oil and gas properties, (7) interest expense, and (8) income taxes. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flow as determined by GAAP. The amounts included in the calculation of EBITDAX were computed in accordance with GAAP. EBITDAX is presented herein and reconciled to the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund development and exploration activities. This measure is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
 
 
The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDAX to net (loss) income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively (in thousands, except per-share amounts).
 
PV-10
The present value of our proved reserves, discounted at 10% ("PV-10"), was estimated at $830.9 million at December 31, 2012, and was calculated based on the first-of-the-month, twelve-month average prices for oil, NGLs and gas, of $94.71 per Bbl of oil, $37.88 per Bbl of NGLs and $2.74 per MMBtu of natural gas, respectively.
PV-10 is our estimate of the present value of future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves after deducting estimated production and ad valorem taxes, future capital costs and operating expenses, but before deducting any estimates of future income taxes. The estimated future net revenues are discounted at an annual rate of 10% to determine their "present value." We believe PV-10 to be an important measure for evaluating the relative significance of our oil and gas properties and that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure of PV-10 provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and investors in evaluating oil and gas companies. Because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid, we believe the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable for evaluating the Company. We believe that PV-10 is a financial measure routinely used and calculated similarly by other companies in the oil and gas industry.
 
 
The following table reconciles PV-10 to our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. PV-10 should not be considered as an alternative to the standardized measure as computed under GAAP.
 
Finding and Development Costs
are calculated by dividing the sum of property acquisition costs, exploration costs and development costs for the year by the sum of reserve extensions and discoveries, purchases of minerals in place and total revisions for the year.
All-in finding and development ("F&D") costs
are calculated by dividing the sum of exploration costs and development costs for the year by the total of reserve extensions and discoveries for the year.
Drill-bit F&D costs
We believe that providing the above measures of F&D cost is useful to assist in an evaluation of how much it costs the Company, on a per Boe basis, to add proved reserves. However, these measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our previous SEC filings and to be included in our annual report on Form 10-K to be filed with the SEC on or before March 1, 2013. Due to various factors, including timing differences, F&D costs do not necessarily reflect precisely the costs associated with particular reserves. For example, exploration costs may be recorded in periods before the periods in which related increases in reserves are recorded, and development costs may be recorded in periods after the periods in which related increases in reserves are recorded. In addition, changes in commodity prices can affect the magnitude of recorded increases (or decreases) in reserves independent of the related costs of such increases.
As a result of the above factors and various factors that could materially affect the timing and amounts of future increases in reserves and the timing and amounts of future costs, including factors disclosed in our filings with the SEC, we cannot assure you that the Company's future F&D costs will not differ materially from those set forth above. Further, the methods used by us to calculate F&D costs may differ significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, our F&D costs may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.
 
 
The following table reconciles our estimated F&D costs for 2012 to the information required by paragraphs 11 and 21 of ASC 932-235:
 
Liquidity
Liquidity is calculated by adding the net funds available under our revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents. We use liquidity as an indicator of the Company's ability to fund development and exploration activities. However, this measurement has limitations. This measurement can vary from year-to-year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the measurement on a company's financial statements. This measurement is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
The table below summarizes our liquidity at December 31, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands).
 
 
 
Long-Term Debt-to-Capital
Long-term debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as of December 31, 2012, and by dividing long-term debt (GAAP) by the sum of total stockholders' equity (GAAP) and long-term debt (GAAP). We use the long-term debt-to-capital ratio as a measurement of our overall financial leverage. However, this ratio has limitations. This ratio can vary from year-to-year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the ratio on a company's financial statements. This ratio is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
The table below summarizes our long-term debt-to-capital ratio at December 31, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands).

Forward-Looking Statements
This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this presentation that address activities, events or developments that the Company expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, forward-looking statements contained in this presentation specifically include the expectations of management regarding plans, strategies, objectives, anticipated financial and operating results of the Company, including as to the Company's Wolfcamp shale resource play, estimated resource potential and recoverability of the oil and gas, estimated reserves and drilling locations, capital expenditures, typical well results and well profiles, type curve, and production and operating expenses guidance included in the presentation. These statements are based on certain assumptions made by the Company based on management's experience and technical analyses, current conditions, anticipated future developments and other factors believed to be appropriate and believed to be reasonable by management. When used in this presentation, the words "will," "potential," "believe," "intend," "expect," "may," "should," "anticipate," "could," "estimate," "plan," "predict," "project," "target," "profile," "model" or their negatives, other similar expressions or the statements that include those words, are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. Such statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. In particular, careful consideration should begiven to thecautionary statementsand risk factors described in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the Company undertakes no obligation to correct or update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.
Cautionary Statements Regarding Oil & Gas Quantities
The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved, probable and possible reserves that meet the SEC's definitions for such terms, and price and cost sensitivities for such reserves, and prohibits disclosure of resources that do not constitute such reserves. The Company uses the terms "estimated ultimate recovery" or "EUR," reserve or resource "potential," and other descriptions of volumes of reserves potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that the SEC's rules may prohibit the Company from including in filings with the SEC. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of being actually realized by the Company.
EUR estimates, identified drilling locations and resource potential estimates have not been risked by the Company. Actual locations drilled and quantities that may be ultimately recovered from the Company's interest may differ substantially from the Company's estimates. There is no commitment by the Company to drill all of the drilling locations that have been attributed these quantities. Factors affecting ultimate recovery include the scope of the Company's ongoing drilling program, which will be directly affected by the availability of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling and completion services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, regulatory approval and actual drilling results, as well as geological and mechanical factors Estimates of unproved reserves, type/decline curves, per well EUR and resource potential may change significantly as development of the Company's oil and gas assets provides additional data.
Type/decline curves, estimated EURs, resource potential, recovery factors and well costs represent Company estimates based on evaluation of petrophysical analysis, core data and well logs, well performance from limited drilling and recompletion results and seismic data, and have not been reviewed by independent engineers. These are presented as hypothetical recoveries if assumptions and estimates regarding recoverable hydrocarbons, recovery factors and costs prove correct. The Company has very limited production experience with these projects, and accordingly, such estimates may change significantly as results from more wells are evaluated. Estimates of resource potential and EURs do not constitute reserves, but constitute estimates of contingent resources which the SEC has determined are too speculative to include in SEC filings. Unless otherwise noted, IRR estimates are before taxes and assume NYMEX forward-curve oil and gas pricing and Company-generated EUR and decline curve estimates based on Company drilling and completion cost estimates that do not include land, seismic or G&A costs.

Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
April 15, 2013
Approach Resources Inc. today announced preliminary production for first quarter 2013 of 754 MBoe (8.4 MBoe/d), compared to 654 MBoe (7.2 MBoe/d) produced in first quarter 2012, a 15% increase. Estimated oil production for first quarter 2013 increased 63% to 310 MBbls, compared to 191 MBbls produced in first quarter 2012. Estimated production for first quarter 2013 was 41% oil, 28% NGLs and 31% natural gas, compared to 29% oil, 33% NGLs and 38% natural gas in first quarter 2012.
Fort Worth, Texas, April 15, 2013
(NASDAQ: AREX)
As previously reported, estimated production for first quarter 2013 was impacted by a third-party NGL fractionation facility repair and maintenance, decreasing our average volumes by approximately 6.1 MBoe/d beginning the second week in March. As of April 6, 2013, substantially all production was back online. Turnaround activity for NGL fractionators along the Gulf Coast typically occurs during the spring season. We currently do not expect further downtime as a result of this activity, but will provide an update if conditions change.
Beginning April 3, 2013, we began flowing oil down our joint venture pipeline, which is a 38-mile pipeline primarily in Crockett and Reagan counties. We expect that the oil pipeline will enable the Company to efficiently transport our crude oil production to market, reduce our transportation differential and provide optionality for accessing markets with superior price realizations.
Conference Call Scheduled for May 3, 2013
Approach will host a conference call on Friday, May 3, 2013, at 10:00 a.m. Central Time (11:00 a.m. Eastern Time) to discuss first quarter 2013 financial and operating results. The Company plans to issue first quarter 2013 results after market close on Thursday, May 2, 2013.

Exhibit 99.1        
 
For Immediate Release
May 2, 2013
 Approach Resources Inc. today reported results for first quarter 2013. Highlights for first quarter 2013, compared to first quarter 2012, include:
Fort Worth, Texas, May 2, 2013
(NASDAQ: AREX)
 
 
 
 
 
 
Production for first quarter 2013 totaled 754 MBoe (8.4 MBoe/d), compared to production of 654 MBoe (7.2 MBoe/d) in first quarter 2012, a 15% increase. Oil production for first quarter 2013 increased 63% to 310 MBbls, compared to 191 MBbls produced in first quarter 2012. Production for first quarter 2013 was 41% oil, 28% NGLs and 31% natural gas, compared to 29% oil, 33% NGLs and 38% natural gas in first quarter 2012. As previously reported, estimated production for first quarter 2013 was impacted by a third-party NGL fractionation facility's repair and maintenance.
Management Comment
J. Ross Craft, the Company's President and CEO, commented, "We are encouraged by the improvement in our per-unit costs this quarter compared to fourth quarter 2012. In addition, we continue to see our horizontal well costs trend lower. Horizontal drilling and completion costs for first quarter 2013 averaged approximately $6.1 million per well, down from $6.4 million for the second half of 2012. We're also encouraged by the initial results from our stacked wellbore pilot program and from our ongoing development in the horizontal Wolfcamp shale play. We plan to continue testing multi-bench development in Project Pangea, including testing optimal well spacing and drilling pattern, to maximize recoveries, efficiencies and savings."
First Quarter 2013 Financial Results
Net loss for first quarter 2013 was $347,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, on revenues of $36.3 million. This compares to net income for first quarter 2012 of $1.7 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, on revenues of $30.6 million. First quarter 2013 revenues increased $5.7 million due to an increase in production volumes and gas price realizations ($10.9 million), partially offset by a decrease in oil and NGL price realizations ($5.2 million). Net loss for first quarter 2013 included an unrealized loss on commodity derivatives of $4.1 million and a realized gain on commodity derivatives of $307,000.
Excluding the unrealized loss on commodity derivatives and related income tax effect, adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for first quarter 2013 was $2.4 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, compared to $3.5 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, for first quarter 2012. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of adjusted net income to net (loss) income.
 
EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for first quarter 2013 was $24.4 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, compared to $20.8 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, for first quarter 2012. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our reconciliation of EBITDAX to net (loss) income.
Average realized commodity prices for first quarter 2013, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $82.01/Bbl of oil, $29.17/Bbl of NGLs and $3.32/Mcf of natural gas, compared to $94.39/Bbl of oil, $42.50/Bbl of NGLs and $2.35/Mcf of natural gas for first quarter 2012. Our average realized price, including the effect of commodity derivatives, was $48.51/Boe for first quarter 2013, up 5% compared to $46.10/Boe for first quarter 2012.
Our average realized oil price was impacted by the regional Midland/Cushing differential during first quarter 2013. For first quarter 2013, our average realized oil price, excluding oil derivatives, of $82.01/Bbl reflected a regional and transportation differential of approximately $12.37/Bbl below NYMEX WTI. On April 3, 2013, we began flowing oil down our joint venture pipeline. As a result of our current outlook for the Midland/Cushing differential, our differential derivative position and transporting our oil production by pipeline, we expect our oil differential will decrease for the remainder of 2013.
Lease operating expenses ("LOE") increased in first quarter 2013 compared to first quarter 2012 primarily due to higher well repair, maintenance and water hauling expenses. Production and ad valorem taxes increased from the prior year quarter due to our increase in oil, NGL and gas sales. General and administrative expenses ("G&A") increased from the prior year quarter primarily due to higher salaries and benefits, a result of increased staffing. Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense ("DD&A") increased from the prior year quarter primarily due to higher production and oil and gas property carrying costs, relative to estimated proved developed reserves. Higher oil and gas property carrying costs primarily reflect our development of our oil-focused Wolfcamp shale play.
LOE, G&A and DD&A per Boe decreased in first quarter 2013, compared to fourth quarter 2012. In addition, LOE per Boe decreased for the second quarter in a row. Overall, costs decreased 10.5% sequentially. The following table is a summary of first quarter 2013 expenses per Boe, compared to fourth quarter 2012.
 
Operations Update
During first quarter 2013, we drilled 10 wells and completed five wells, including three wells that were waiting on completion at December 31, 2012. At March 31, 2013, 12 wells were in progress or waiting on completion, of which five wells were completed and turned to sales shortly after March 31, 2013. We expect second quarter production to range from 9.3 MBoe/d to 9.6 MBoe/d.
We currently have three horizontal rigs drilling in Project Pangea, and our program for testing multi-bench development is underway. During first quarter 2013, we targeted the Wolfcamp A and B
 
benches with two stacked wellbores in Pangea West. These two wells were drilled from a single pad, completed with 26 stages and flowed at an initial production rate ranging from 705 Boe/d to 843 Boe/d, with an average oil cut of 94%. These are our best wells drilled and completed in Pangea West to date based on initial performance.
Also, in north Project Pangea, we targeted the Wolfcamp A and B benches with four stacked wellbores. These four wells were drilled in a chevron pattern, completed with 26 to 27 stages and flowed at an initial production rate ranging from 366 Boe/d to 701 Boe/d, with an average oil cut of 84%.
2013 Capital Expenditures
Costs incurred during first quarter 2013 totaled $69.5 million, consisting of $61.8 million for drilling and completion activities, $6.7 million for pipeline, infrastructure projects and other equipment and $1 million for acreage acquisitions and extensions and 3-D seismic data acquisition. Approximately $60.6 million of the $61.8 million for drilling and completion activities includes capital for drilling nine horizontal wells and completing 10 horizontal wells. Also, in first quarter 2013, we made a capital contribution to our pipeline joint venture of $6.3 million for oil pipeline and facilities construction.
Liquidity and Commodity Derivatives Update
At March 31, 2013, we had a $300 million revolving credit agreement with a $280 million borrowing base and $152.3 million outstanding. At March 31, 2013, our liquidity and long-term debt-to-capital ratio were $128 million and 19.3%, respectively. See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures" below for our calculation of "liquidity" and "long-term debt-to-capital ratio."
The lenders under our revolving credit agreement completed their semi-annual borrowing base redetermination, resulting in an increase to the borrowing base to $315 million from $280 million. In addition, the total facility amount increased to $500 million from $300 million and the term was extended to July 31, 2016, from July 31, 2014. Pro forma for the borrowing base increase, our liquidity was $163 million at March 31, 2013.
We enter into commodity derivatives positions to manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. Please refer to the "Unaudited Commodity Derivatives Information" table below for a detailed summary of the Company's current derivatives positions.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures
This release contains certain financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. We have provided reconciliations below of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and on the Non-GAAP Financial Information page in the Investor Relations section of our website at . 
www.approachresources.com
Adjusted Net Income
This release contains the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, which excludes an unrealized loss on commodity derivatives and the related income tax effect. The amounts included in the calculation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share below were computed in accordance with GAAP. We believe adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are useful to investors because they provide readers with a more meaningful measure of our profitability before recording certain items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably determined. However, these measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
The table below provides a reconciliation of adjusted net income to net (loss) income for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands, except per-share amounts).
 
 
EBITDAX
We define EBITDAX as net (loss) income, plus (1) exploration expense, (2) depletion, depreciation and amortization expense, (3) share-based compensation expense, (4) unrealized loss on commodity derivatives, (5) interest expense, and (6) income taxes. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flow as determined by GAAP. The amounts included in the calculation of EBITDAX were computed in accordance with GAAP. EBITDAX is presented herein and reconciled to the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund development and exploration activities. This measure is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
The table below provides a reconciliation of EBITDAX to net (loss) income for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively (in thousands, except per-share amounts).
 
 
Liquidity
Liquidity is calculated by adding the net funds available under our revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents. We use liquidity as an indicator of the Company's ability to fund development and exploration activities. However, this measurement has limitations. This measurement can vary from year-to-year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the measurement on a company's financial statements. This measurement is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
The table below summarizes our liquidity at March 31, 2013, and our liquidity at March 31, 2013, on a pro forma basis to give effect to our May 1, 2013, borrowing base increase (in thousands).
 
Long-Term Debt-to-Capital
Long-term debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as of March 31, 2013, and by dividing long-term debt (GAAP) by the sum of total stockholders' equity (GAAP) and long-term debt (GAAP). We use the long-term debt-to-capital ratio as a measurement of our overall financial leverage. However, this ratio has limitations. This ratio can vary from year-to-year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the ratio on a company's financial statements. This ratio is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.
The table below summarizes our long-term debt-to-capital ratio at March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 (in thousands).

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Underwriting Agreement
On June 6, 2013, Approach Resources Inc. (the "Company"), and certain subsidiary guarantors of the Company (the "Subsidiary Guarantors") entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as representative of the several underwriters named therein, with respect to the public offering by the Company of $250,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 7.00% Senior Notes due 2021 (the "Notes"). The Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), pursuant to the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3ASR (File No. 333-174318), which became effective upon filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on May 18, 2011 (the "Registration Statement"), and as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Notes dated June 6, 2013 and filed with the Commission on June 7, 2013.
The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, as applicable, including obligations of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, as applicable, to indemnify the underwriters for certain liabilities under the Securities Act. The foregoing description of the Underwriting Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Underwriting Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Completion of the Public Offering of the Notes and Entry into the Indenture
On June 11, 2013, the Company completed the public offering of the Notes. The Company expects to use the net proceeds from the offering of approximately $243 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the Company's revolving credit facility, to fund the Company's capital expenditures and for general working capital needs.
The terms of the Notes are governed by the Senior Indenture, dated as of June 11, 2013 (the "Base Indenture"), by and among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture, dated as of June 11, 2013 (the "First Supplemental Indenture"), by and among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee, setting forth the specific terms applicable to the Notes. The Base Indenture, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, is referred to herein as the "Indenture." Interest on the Notes will accrue from June 11, 2013 and will be payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on December 15, 2013. The Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company's existing and future senior indebtedness and senior to any subordinated debt that the Company may incur. The guarantees rank equally in right of payment to all of the Subsidiary Guarantors' existing and future senior indebtedness and senior in right of payment of all of the Subsidiary Guarantors' existing and future subordinated debt.
The Notes are redeemable at the Company's option, in whole or in part, at any time before June 15, 2016, at the make-whole price set forth in the Indenture, and on or after such date at fixed redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. At any time prior to June 15, 2016, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the Notes with an amount of cash not greater than the cash proceeds that the Company raises in one or more equity offerings at a redemption price of 107.00% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption so long as (i) at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued remains outstanding after the redemption and (ii) such redemption occurs within 180 days of closing the related equity offering.
 
The Indenture contains covenants that will, subject to certain exceptions, limit the ability of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors to create liens on their properties or assets, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, merge or consolidate with another entity and sell, lease or transfer substantially all of their properties or assets to another entity. Further, the Indenture provides that the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors will no longer be subject to certain covenants when the Notes receive investment grade ratings from Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Moody's Investors Services, Inc.
The Indenture also contains customary events of default, including (i) default in the payment of any interest upon any Note when it becomes due and payable for a period of 30 days; (ii) default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, on any Note when due at its stated maturity, upon redemption or otherwise; and (iii) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company or a significant subsidiary or a group of restricted subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a significant subsidiary or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors. If an event of default occurs and is continuing with respect to the Notes, the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare the principal amount and all accrued and unpaid interest to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, the principal amount and all accrued and unpaid interest will become due and payable immediately. If an event of default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization described above is continuing, the principal amount of the Notes outstanding will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holders of the Notes.
Other material terms of the Notes and the Indenture are described in the prospectus supplement dated June 6, 2013, as filed by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors with the Commission on June 7, 2013. The foregoing descriptions of the Base Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Base Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture, copies of which are filed herewith as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively.
Relationships
Certain of the Underwriters and their respective affiliates have performed, and may in the future perform, certain commercial banking, financial advisory, investment banking and other services for the Company, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. Affiliates of certain of the Underwriters are lenders under the Company's revolving credit facility, and, in such capacity, will receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering. Additionally, an affiliate of one of the Underwriters will serve as trustee for the Notes.

Indemnification of the Underwriters
 
(b) . Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of the Guarantors, each of their respective directors, each of their respective officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any of the Guarantors within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use in the Registration Statement, Preliminary Prospectus, any of the other Time of Sale Information, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the following in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus: the third sentence of the fifth paragraph and the tenth paragraph under the heading "Underwriting; Conflicts of interest."
Indemnification of the Company and the Guarantors
(c) . If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under paragraph (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under paragraph (a) or (b) above. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 8 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be paid or reimbursed as they are incurred; , however that if indemnity may be sought pursuant to paragraph (a) above in respect of such proceeding, then in addition to such separate firm of the Underwriters, their affiliates and such control persons of the Underwriters the indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of not more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for Tudor Pickering in its capacity as a "qualified

independent underwriter", its affiliates, directors, officers and all persons, if any, who control Tudor Pickering within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and any such separate firm for the Company, the Guarantors, their respective directors, their respective officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company and the Guarantors shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) . If the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters or Tudor Pickering in its capacity as a "qualified independent underwriter", as the case may be, on the other, from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters or Tudor Pickering in its capacity as a "qualified independent underwriter", as the case may be, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters or Tudor Pickering in its capacity as a "qualified independent underwriter", as the case may be, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, or the fee to be received by Tudor Pickering in its capacity as a "qualified independent underwriter", as the case may be, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters or Tudor Pickering in its capacity as a "qualified independent underwriter", as the case may be, on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or any Guarantor or by the Underwriters or Tudor Pickering in its capacity as a "qualified independent underwriter", as the case may be, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution
 
(e) . The Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability
pro rata
(f) . The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies
(g) . Without limitation and in addition to its obligation under the other sub-sections of this Section 8, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the QIU, its officers and employees and each person, if any, who controls the QIU within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act from and against any loss, claim, damage, liabilities or expense, as incurred, arising out of or based upon the QIU's acting as a "qualified independent underwriter" (within the meaning of NASD Conduct Rule 2720(f)(12) of FINRA) in connection with the offering contemplated by this Agreement, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified person for any legal or other expense reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense results from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the QIU.

Termination
 
10. .
Defaulting Underwriter

If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
pro
rata
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company or the Guarantors, except that the Company and each of the Guarantors will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 8 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
(d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company, the Guarantors or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
11. .

(b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9, (ii) the Company for any reason fails to tender the Securities for delivery to the Underwriters or (iii) the Underwriters decline to purchase the Securities for any reason permitted under this Agreement (other than by termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9(i), (iii) or (iv)), the Company and each of the Guarantors jointly and severally agree to reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby.

Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. No purchaser of Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor merely by reason of such purchase.
Persons Entitled to Benefit of Agreement
13. . The respective indemnities, rights of contribution, representations, warranties and agreements of the Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of the Company, the Guarantors or the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company, the Guarantors, the Underwriters or the QIU.

Acts of Holders; Record Dates.
Whenever in this Indenture it is provided that the Holders of a specified percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any or all series may take action (including the making of any demand or request, the giving of any direction, notice, consent or waiver or the taking of any other action) the fact that at the time of taking any such action the Holders of such specified percentage have joined therein may be evidenced (a) by any instrument or any number of instruments of similar tenor executed by Holders in person or by agent or proxy appointed in writing, (b) by the record of the Holders voting in favor thereof at any meeting of Holders duly called and held in accordance with procedures approved by the Trustee, (c) by a combination of such instrument or instruments and any such record of such a meeting of Holders or (d) in the case of Securities evidenced by a Global Security, by any electronic transmission or other message, whether or not in written format, that complies with the Depositary's applicable procedures.

Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent or proxy shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 601) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section.

The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner that the Trustee deems sufficient. The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register.
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.
 
The Company may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to give, make or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given, made or taken by Holders of Securities of such series, provided that the Company may not set a record date for, and the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to, the giving or making of any notice, declaration, request or direction referred to in the next paragraph. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to take the relevant action, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Company from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company, at its own expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Trustee in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106.
The Trustee may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to join in the giving or making of (i) any Notice of Default, (ii) any declaration of acceleration referred to in Section 502, (iii) any request to institute proceedings referred to in Section 507(2) or (iv) any direction referred to in Section 512, in each case with respect to Securities of such series. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to join in such notice, declaration, request or direction, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Trustee from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Trustee, at the Company's expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Company in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106.
With respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which sets such record dates may designate any day as the "" and from time to time may change the Expiration Date to any earlier or later day; provided that no such change shall be effective unless notice of the proposed new Expiration Date is given to the other party hereto in writing, and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106, on or prior to the existing Expiration Date. If an Expiration Date is not designated with respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which set such record date shall be deemed to have initially designated the 180th day after such record date as the Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the Expiration Date as provided in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Expiration Date shall be later than the 180th day after the applicable record date.
Expiration Date
Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the principal amount of such Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such principal amount.
SECTION 105
Notices, Etc., to Trustee and Company.
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with:

SECTION 106
Notice to Holders; Waiver.
Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing in the English language and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date (if any), and not earlier than the earliest date (if any), prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.
SECTION 107
Conflict with Trust Indenture Act.
If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with a provision of the Trust Indenture Act which is required under such Act to be a part of and govern this Indenture, the latter provision shall control. If any provision of this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust Indenture Act which may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision shall be deemed to apply to this Indenture as so modified or to be excluded, as the case may be.

SECTION 114
No Recourse Against Others.

Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount and, if applicable, having endorsed thereon notations of Subsidiary Guarantees executed by the Subsidiary Guarantors. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series and tenor.

SECTION 306
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.

If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless from any loss that any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a protected purchaser, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, and, if applicable, the Subsidiary Guarantors shall execute the notation of Subsidiary Guarantee endorsed thereon. In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable or is to be converted, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay or authorize the conversion of such Security (without surrender thereof save in the case of a mutilated Security).
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.

The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 611 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.

(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 609 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Holder, or
(3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then, in any such case, (A) the Company by a Board Resolution may remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities, or (B) subject to Section 514, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees.
If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series) and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 611.

any series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 611, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.

Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.
In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to all Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.
In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates.
Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in the first or second preceding paragraph, as the case may be.
No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article.
SECTION 612
Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.
Any Person into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such Person shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. As soon as practicable, the successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to the Company and the Holders of the Securities then
 
Outstanding. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities.
SECTION 613
Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company and Subsidiary Guarantors.
If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any other obligor upon the Securities, the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Company, such Subsidiary Guarantor or any such other obligor.
SECTION 614
Appointment of Authenticating Agent.
The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon original issue and upon exchange, registration of transfer, conversion or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 306, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a Person organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
Any Person into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such Person shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall give notice of such appointment in the manner provided in Section 106 to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
The Trustee agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section, and the Trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed for such payments, subject to the provisions of Section 607.
 
If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternative certificate of authentication in the following form:
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

The rights of Holders to communicate with other Holders with respect to their rights under this Indenture or under the Securities, and the corresponding rights and privileges of the Trustee, shall be as provided by the Trust Indenture Act.
Every Holder of Securities, by receiving and holding the same, agrees with the Company and the Trustee that neither the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors nor the Trustee nor any agent of any of them shall be held accountable by reason of any disclosure of information as to names and addresses of Holders made pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act.

The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and each of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.
The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in each Place of Payment for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.
 
SECTION 1003
Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust.
If the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any of the Securities of that series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal and any premium and interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities, it will, prior to 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Securities of that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such amount, such sum to be held as provided by the Trust Indenture Act, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will (1) comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act applicable to it as a Paying Agent and (2) during the continuance of any default by the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors, if applicable, or any other obligor upon the Securities of that series in the making of any payment in respect of the Securities of that series, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums held in trust by such Paying Agent for payment in respect of the Securities of that series.
The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general circulation in The City of New York, New York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.

(b) The Company shall, so long as any series of Securities is Outstanding, deliver to the Trustee, as soon as possible and in any event within five days after the Company becomes aware of the occurrence of an Event of Default or an event which, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute an Event of Default, an Officers' Certificate setting forth the details of such Event of Default or default, and the action which the Company proposes to take with respect thereto.
 
SECTION 1005
Existence.
Subject to Article Eight, the Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect the existence, rights (charter and statutory) and franchises of the Company; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such right or franchise if it shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and that the loss thereof is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.
SECTION 1006
Maintenance of Properties.
The Company will cause all properties used or useful in the conduct of its business or the business of any Subsidiary to be maintained and kept in good condition, repair and working order (reasonable wear and tear excepted) and supplied with all necessary equipment and will cause to be made all necessary repairs, renewals, replacements, betterments and improvements thereof, all as in the judgment of the Company may be necessary so that the business carried on in connection therewith may be properly and advantageously conducted at all times; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall prevent the Company from discontinuing the operation or maintenance of any of such properties if such discontinuance is, in the judgment of the Company, desirable in the conduct of its business or the business of any Subsidiary and not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.
SECTION 1007
Payment of Taxes and Other Claims.

SECTION 1008
Maintenance of Insurance.
The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, keep at all times all of their properties which are of an insurable nature insured against loss or damage with insurers believed by the Company to be responsible to the extent that property of similar character is usually so insured by corporations similarly situated and owning like properties in accordance with good business practice.
SECTION 1009
Waiver of Certain Covenants.
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of such series, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors may, with respect to the Securities of any series, omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in any of Sections 1005 through 1008 or in any covenant provided pursuant to Section 301(21), 901(2) or 901(7) for the benefit of the Holders of such series if before the time for such compliance the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall, by Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provision or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect.
SECTION 1101

The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution or in another manner specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company of less than all the Securities of any series (including any such redemption affecting only a single Security), the Company shall, at least five Business Days prior to giving notice of such redemption (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date, of the principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed and, if applicable, of the tenor of the Securities to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction.
SECTION 1103
Selection by Trustee of Securities to Be Redeemed.
If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed (unless all the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed or unless such redemption affects only a single Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, (i) in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange on which such Securities are listed, if such Securities are listed on any national securities exchange, and (ii) if such Securities are not so listed, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of a portion of the principal amount of any Security of such series, provided that the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of any Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security. If less than all the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed (unless such redemption affects only a single Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series and specified tenor not previously called for redemption in accordance with the preceding sentence.
The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for redemption as aforesaid and, in case of any Securities selected for partial redemption as aforesaid, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
The provisions of the two preceding paragraphs shall not apply with respect to any redemption affecting only a single Security, whether such Security is to be redeemed in whole or in part. In the case of any such redemption in part, the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of the Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security.
For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed. If any Security selected for partial redemption is surrendered for conversion after such selection, the converted portion of such Security shall be deemed (so far as may be) to be the portion selected for redemption. Upon any redemption of less than all the Securities of a series, for purposes of selection for redemption the Company and the Trustee may treat as Outstanding Securities surrendered for conversion during the period of 15 days next preceding the mailing of a notice of redemption, and need not treat as Outstanding any Security authenticated and delivered during such period in exchange for the unconverted portion of any Security converted in part during such period.
SECTION 1104
Notice of Redemption.
Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at his address appearing in the Security Register; provided, however, notice of redemption may be given more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date if the notice is issued in connection with a satisfaction and discharge pursuant to Article Four.
All notices of redemption shall state:
(1) the Redemption Date,
(2) the Redemption Price, if then determinable and otherwise the method of its determination,
 
(3) if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series consisting of more than a single Security are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption of any such Securities, the principal amounts) of the particular Securities to be redeemed and, if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series consisting of a single Security are to be redeemed, the principal amount of the particular Security to be redeemed,
(4) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date,
(5) the place or places where each such Security is to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price,
(6) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case; and
(7) if applicable, the conversion price then in effect and the date on which the right to convert such Securities will expire.
Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company and shall be irrevocable. If any Security called for redemption is converted pursuant hereto, any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent or so segregated and held in trust for the redemption of such Security shall be paid to the Company upon delivery of a Company Request to the Trustee or such Paying Agent, or, if then held by the Company, shall be discharged from such trust.
SECTION 1105
Deposit of Redemption Price.
Prior to 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities which are to be redeemed on that date.
SECTION 1106
Securities Payable on Redemption Date.
Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 307.
If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal and any premium shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security.
 
SECTION 1107
Securities Redeemed in Part.
Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, if applicable, the Subsidiary Guarantors shall execute the notations of Subsidiary Guarantees endorsed thereon, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series and of like tenor, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered.
SECTION 1301
Applicability of Article.
Unless the Company elects to issue any series of Securities without the benefit of the Subsidiary Guarantees, which election shall be evidenced in or pursuant to the Board Resolution or supplemental indenture establishing such series of Securities pursuant to Section 301, the provisions of this Article shall be applicable to each series of Securities except as otherwise specified in or pursuant to the Board Resolution or supplemental indenture establishing such series pursuant to Section 301.
SECTION 1302
Subsidiary Guarantees.
Subject to Section 1301, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby, jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, the due and punctual payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on such Security when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at the Stated Maturity, by acceleration, call for redemption, offer to purchase or otherwise, in accordance with the terms of such Security and of this Indenture, and each Subsidiary Guarantor similarly guarantees to the Trustee the payment of all amounts owing to the Trustee in accordance with the terms of this Indenture. In case of the failure of the Company punctually to make any such payment, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby, jointly and severally, agrees to cause such payment to be made punctually when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at the Stated Maturity or by acceleration, call for redemption, offer to purchase or otherwise, and as if such payment were made by the Company.
Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby jointly and severally agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be absolute, unconditional, irrespective of, and shall be unaffected by, the validity, regularity or enforceability of such Security or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same or any release, amendment, waiver or indulgence granted to the Company or any other guarantor or any consent to departure from any requirement of any other guarantee of all or any of the Securities of such series or any other circumstances which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, no such release, amendment, waiver or indulgence shall, without the consent of such Subsidiary Guarantor, increase the principal amount of such Security, or increase the interest rate thereon, or alter the Stated Maturity thereof. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby waives the benefits of diligence, presentment, demand for payment, any requirement that the Trustee or any of the Holders protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest in or other lien on any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against the Company or any other Person or any collateral, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest or notice with respect to such Security or the indebtedness evidenced thereby and all demands whatsoever, and covenants that this Subsidiary Guarantee will not be discharged in respect of such Security except by complete performance of the obligations contained in such Security and in such Subsidiary Guarantee. Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that if, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee or any of the Holders are prevented by applicable law from exercising their respective rights to accelerate the maturity of the Securities of a series, to collect interest on the Securities of a series, or to enforce or exercise any other right or remedy with respect to the Securities of a series, such Subsidiary Guarantor agrees to pay to the Trustee for the account of the Holders, upon demand therefor, the amount that would otherwise have been due and payable had such rights and remedies been permitted to be exercised by the Trustee or any of the Holders.
 
Each Subsidiary Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights of the Holders of the Securities upon which its Subsidiary Guarantee is endorsed against the Company in respect of any amounts paid by such Subsidiary Guarantor on account of such Security pursuant to the provisions of its Subsidiary Guarantee or this Indenture; provided, however, that no Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to enforce or to receive any payments arising out of, or based upon, such right of subrogation until the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on all Securities of the relevant series issued hereunder shall have been paid in full.
Each Subsidiary Guarantor that makes or is required to make any payment in respect of its Subsidiary Guarantee shall be entitled to seek contribution from the other Subsidiary Guarantors to the extent permitted by applicable law; provided, however, that no Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to enforce or receive any payments arising out of, or based upon, such right of contribution until the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on all Securities of the relevant series issued hereunder shall have been paid in full.
Each Subsidiary Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and continue to be effective should any petition be filed by or against the Company for liquidation or reorganization, should the Company become insolvent or make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or should a receiver or trustee be appointed for all or any part of the Company's assets, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment and performance of the Securities of a series, is, pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be restored or returned by any Holder of the Securities, whether as a "voidable preference," "fraudulent transfer," or otherwise, all as though such payment or performance had not been made. In the event that any payment, or any part thereof, is rescinded, reduced, restored or returned, the Securities shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be reinstated and deemed reduced only by such amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored or returned.
SECTION 1303
Execution and Delivery of Notations of Subsidiary Guarantees.
To further evidence the Subsidiary Guarantee set forth in Section 1302, each of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby agrees that a notation relating to such Subsidiary Guarantee, substantially in the form set forth in Section 204, shall be endorsed on each Security entitled to the benefits of the Subsidiary Guarantee authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and executed by either manual or facsimile signature of an officer of such Subsidiary Guarantor, or in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor that is a limited partnership, an officer of the general partner of each Subsidiary Guarantor. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby agrees that the Subsidiary Guarantee set forth in Section 1302 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Security a notation relating to the Subsidiary Guarantee. If any officer of the Subsidiary Guarantor, or in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor that is a limited partnership, any officer of the general partner of the Subsidiary Guarantor, whose signature is on this Indenture or a Security no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates such Security or at any time thereafter, the Subsidiary Guarantee of such Security shall be valid nevertheless. The delivery of any Security by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of the Subsidiary Guarantee set forth in this Indenture on behalf of the Subsidiary Guarantors.
SECTION 1304
Release of Subsidiary Guarantors.
Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 with respect to a series of Securities, each Subsidiary Guarantee will remain in effect with respect to the respective Subsidiary Guarantor until the entire principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities to which such Subsidiary Guarantee relates shall have been paid in full or otherwise satisfied and discharged in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and this Indenture and all amounts owing to the Trustee hereunder have been paid; provided, however, that if (i) such Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of this Indenture, (ii) either Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance occurs with respect to such Securities pursuant to Article Fifteen or (iii) all or substantially all of the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor or all of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor is sold (including by sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise) by the Company or any Subsidiary in a transaction complying with the requirements of this Indenture, then, in each case of (i), (ii) or (iii), upon delivery by the Company of an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the release of such Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee and this Article Thirteen have been complied with, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be released and discharged of its obligations under its Subsidiary
 
Guarantee and under this Article Thirteen without any action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder, and the Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably required in order to acknowledge the release of such Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee endorsed on the Securities of such series and under this Article Thirteen.
SECTION 1305
Additional Subsidiary Guarantors.
Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 with respect to a series of Securities, the Company will cause any domestic Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Company that becomes a Subsidiary after the date the Securities of a series are first issued hereunder to become a Subsidiary Guarantor as soon as practicable after such Subsidiary becomes a Subsidiary. The Company shall cause any such Wholly Owned Subsidiary to become a Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to the Securities by executing and delivering to the Trustee (a) a supplemental indenture, in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee, which subjects such Person to the provisions (including the representations and warranties) of this Indenture as a Subsidiary Guarantor and (b) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture has been duly authorized and executed by such Person and such supplemental indenture and such Person's obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee and this Indenture constitute the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of such Person (subject to such customary exceptions concerning creditors' rights and equitable principles as may be acceptable to the Trustee in its discretion).
SECTION 1306
Limitation on Liability.
Any term or provision of this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum amount of the Subsidiary Guarantee of any Subsidiary Guarantor shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be hereby guaranteed by such Subsidiary Guarantor without rendering such Subsidiary Guarantee voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.
SECTION 1501
Company's Option to Effect Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
The Company may elect, at its option at any time, to have Section 1502 or Section 1503 applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, designated pursuant to Section 301 as being defeasible pursuant to such Section 1502 or 1503, in accordance with any applicable requirements provided pursuant to Section 301 and upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article. Any such election shall be evidenced in or pursuant to a Board Resolution or in another manner specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities.
SECTION 1502
Defeasance and Discharge.
Upon the Company's exercise of its option (if any) to have this Section applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations, and each Subsidiary Guarantor shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to its Subsidiary Guarantee of such Securities, as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1504 are satisfied (herein called ""). For this purpose, such Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by such Securities and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and this Indenture insofar as such Securities are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), subject to the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (1) the rights of Holders of such Securities to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 1504 and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities when payments are due, or, if applicable, to convert such Securities in accordance with their terms, (2) the Company's and each Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 304, 305, 306, 1002 and 1003, and, if applicable, their obligations with respect to the conversion of such Securities, (3) the rights, powers, trusts,
Defeasance
 
duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (4) this Article. Subject to compliance with this Article, the Company may exercise its option (if any) to have this Section applied to any Securities notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option (if any) to have Section 1503 applied to such Securities.
SECTION 1503
Covenant Defeasance.
Upon the Company's exercise of its option (if any) to have this Section applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, (1) the Company shall be released from its obligations under Section 801(3), Sections 1005 through 1008, inclusive, and any covenants provided pursuant to Section 301(21), 901(2) or 901(7) for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, and (2) the occurrence of any event specified in Sections 501(5) (with respect to any of Section 801(3), Sections 1006 through 1008, inclusive, and any such covenants provided pursuant to Section 301(21), 901(2) or 901(7)), 501(6), 501(7)), 501(10) and 501(11) shall be deemed not to be or result in an Event of Default and (3) the provisions of Article Thirteen shall cease to be effective, in each case with respect to such Securities and Subsidiary Guarantees as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1504 are satisfied (herein called ""). For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to such Securities, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, as applicable, may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such specified Section (to the extent so specified in the case of Section 501(5)) or Article Thirteen, whether directly or indirectly by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or Article or by reason of any reference in any such Section or Article to any other provision herein or in any other document, but the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby.

Anything in this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company Request any money or U.S. Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 1504 with respect to any Securities which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect the Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, with respect to such Securities.
 
SECTION 1506
Reinstatement.
If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any money in accordance with this Article with respect to any Securities by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the obligations under this Indenture and such Securities from which the Company has been discharged or released pursuant to Section 1502 or 1503 shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article with respect to such Securities, until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all money held in trust pursuant to Section 1505 with respect to such Securities in accordance with this Article; provided, however, that if the Company makes any payment of principal of or any premium or interest on any such Security following such reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights (if any) of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money so held in trust.

The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of any series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities.
The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of any Securities is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of such Securities is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment." If provided for by the terms of any Securities, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 1602. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities as provided for by the terms of such Securities.
SECTION 1602
Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities.

Not less than 35 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for such Securities pursuant to the terms of such Securities, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities pursuant to Section 1602 and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered.

Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 1106 and 1107. This instrument may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Notes on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Trustee, at the Company's expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Company in writing and to each Holder of Notes in the manner set forth in Section 206.
With respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which sets such record date may designate any day as the "Expiration Date" and from time to time may change the Expiration Date to any earlier or later day; that no such change shall be effective unless notice of the proposed new Expiration Date is given to each other party hereto in writing, and to each Holder of Notes in the manner set forth in Section 206, on or prior to the existing Expiration Date. If an Expiration Date is not designated with respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which set such record date shall be deemed to have initially designated the 180th day after such record date as the Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the Expiration Date as provided in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Expiration Date shall be later than the 180th day after the applicable record date.
provided
Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to the Notes may do so with regard to all or any part of the principal amount of such Note or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such principal amount.

In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. If notice is mailed to Holders in the manner provided in this Section 206, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. Where the Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
When the Notes are not Global Notes, in case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.

(3) that any Note not tendered will continue to accrue interest;
(4) that, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Payment Date;
(5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender the Notes, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" attached to the Notes completed, or transfer by book-entry transfer, to the Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;

(7) that Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered (or transferred by book-entry transfer), which unpurchased portion must be equal to $2,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess of $2,000.
The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control.

The Paying Agent will promptly mail or wire transfer to each Holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes (or, if all the Notes are then in global form, make such payment through the facilities of the Depositary), and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes
 
surrendered, if any; that each such new Note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess of $2,000.

The Company will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1110, the Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the price, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this Section 1110 applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer or (2) notice of redemption has been given pursuant to paragraph 5 of the Notes unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price.

(2) at least 75% of the aggregate consideration received in respect of such Asset Sale and all other Asset Sales since the Issue Date by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; that, for purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash:
provided
(a) any liabilities, as shown on the Company's most recent consolidated balance sheet, of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities, Subordinated Debt and any obligations in respect of preferred stock) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets or Equity Interests pursuant to novation agreements (or other legal documentation with the same effect) that includes a full release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from any and all liability therefor;
 
(b) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash within 180 days after the date of the Asset Sale, to the extent of the cash received in that conversion; and
(c) Additional Assets.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 75% limitation referred to in clause (2) of the first paragraph of this Section 1115 shall be deemed satisfied with respect to any Asset Sale in which the cash or Cash Equivalents portion of the consideration received therefrom, determined in accordance with clause (2) of the first paragraph of this Section 1115 on an after-tax basis, is equal to or greater than what the after-tax proceeds would have been had such Asset Sale complied with the aforementioned 75% limitation.
Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, the Company (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may apply such Net Proceeds, at its option:
(1) to repay, prepay, redeem or purchase (x) Indebtedness and other Obligations under a Credit Facility; that, in the case of any such action with respect to a revolving Credit Facility shall be accompanied by a reduction of the related commitments or facility amount, (y) any Indebtedness and other Obligations that were secured by the assets sold in such Asset Sale or (z) other Indebtedness and Obligations with respect thereto; , that in the case of this clause (z), the Company shall also equally and ratably reduce Indebtedness under the notes by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale) to all holders to purchase at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, the principal amount of Notes;

(2) to invest in Additional Assets; or
(3) to make capital expenditures in respect of a Related Business of the Company or Restricted Subsidiary.
that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be deemed to have complied with this paragraph if and to the extent that, within 365 days after the Asset Sale that generated the Net Proceeds, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary has entered into and not abandoned or rejected a binding agreement to consummate any such investment described in this paragraph with the good faith expectation that such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days after the end of such 365-day period; , , that if such commitment is later canceled or terminated before such Net Proceeds are applied or otherwise not applied within such 180 day period, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute "Excess Proceeds."
provided
provided
further
However, pending application or investment of such Net Proceeds as provided in clauses (1) through (3) of the immediately preceding paragraph, such Net Proceeds may be applied to temporarily reduce revolving credit Indebtedness. An amount equal to any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in clauses (1) through (3) above will constitute "Excess Proceeds."
Within ten Business Days after the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $20.0 million, the Company will make an offer (an "") to all Holders of Notes and all holders of other Indebtedness that is with the Notes containing provisions similar to those set forth in this Section 1115 with respect to offers to purchase or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and such other Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price for the Notes in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase, and will be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other Indebtedness tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Company will use the Excess Proceeds to purchase the Notes and such other Indebtedness on a basis. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.
