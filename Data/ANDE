UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON, DC 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported) April 28, 2003 THE ANDERSONS, INC. (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) OHIO 34-1562374 (State or other jurisdiction of (I.R.S. Employer incorporation or organization) Identification No.) 480 W.

Item 12: The following press release was issued on April 28, 2003: FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE AT THE COMPANY: GARY SMITH (419) 891-6417 MONDAY, APRIL 28, 2003 THE ANDERSONS, INC. REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS NET INCOME OF $0.4 MILLION CONSISTENT WITH EARLIER PROJECTIONS EPS OF $0.05 FOR PERIOD VS. $0.22 LAST YEAR MAUMEE, OHIO, APRIL 28, 2003 -- THE ANDERSONS, INC. (NASDAQ: ANDE), today reported first quarter net income of $0.4 million, or $0.05 per diluted share. In the same three-month period of 2002, the company earned $1.6 million, or $0.22 per diluted share. Total revenues of $237.9 million for the period were 11 percent higher than the first quarter of 2002. The company's Agriculture Group achieved an operating income of $0.3 million for the quarter, $2.2 million lower than the $2.5 million it realized in the first quarter of 2002. Revenues of $149.2 million for the quarter were 11 percent higher than 2002's first quarter total of $134.8 million. Plant nutrient sales volumes were higher, and average fertilizer margins rose slightly in spite of an increase in natural gas and nitrogen prices during January and February. These improvements were more than offset, however, by the continued reduction in grain storage income that had been anticipated. World grain stocks, especially corn, have declined significantly during the past two years, and the U.S. has borne a disproportionate share, about half, of this reduction. As a result, earnings from the group's elevators have declined. During the quarter, the group completed a previously announced transaction in which it acquired a minority interest in LGC Grain Company. The first quarter is always an important period for the company's Processing Group as major retailers throughout the country gear up for the spring lawn and garden season and golf course superintendents work to get their greens, tees and fairways in prime condition following the winter. In the January - March period this year, the group achieved an operating income of $3.7 million. This was $1.3 million, or 54 percent, above its 2002 first quarter performance. Total revenues increased by $11.4 million from the $41.0 million generated in the first quarter of 2002 to $52.4 million this year. While product and customer mix shifts caused average gross margins to decline slightly, the volume of turf-care products sold during this three-month period was 24 percent higher than a year ago. Performance of the group's other businesses, the manufacture of cob-based chemical
and feed ingredient carriers, animal bedding and litter products, was commensurate with year-earlier results. Revenues and operating income of the company's Rail Group were relatively unchanged from the first three months of 2002. This year Rail's first quarter income amounted to $0.3 million on revenues of $4.4 million. In the corresponding period of 2002, income was $0.4 million on revenues of $4.2 million. The group's marketing unit continued to acquire railcars during the quarter and now controls a fleet of more than 5,700 railcars and 51 locomotives. The utilization rate of this fleet also improved from a year ago. Although the group benefited from a short-term car leasing opportunity early last year which was not repeated in the first quarter of 2003, this year-to-year decline was mostly offset by sales growth from a new line of railcar discharge gates. The Retail Group experienced an 8 percent reduction in same-store sales for the quarter with revenues of $31.9 million this year vs. $34.8 million a year ago. Easter occurred in the first quarter last year, but fell in the second quarter in 2003. This and new competition in some markets explains some of the year-to-year first quarter sales decline. Colder weather experienced during the late winter months this year and economic uncertainty related to the situation in Iraq also seem to have caused retail consumers to curtail their spending. Because of the reduction in total sales, the group's operating loss for the first quarter increased from $1.7 million in 2002 to $2.6 million this year. Although total expenses grew slightly from a year ago, this was offset by favorable inventory performance and an improvement in average gross margins made possible in part by the recent addition of a meat market in three of the group's six stores. "Our first quarter earnings were right in line with our expectations," said President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson. "For some time now, I've been describing the factors underlying a decline in grain space income. As it turned out, our grain business did even better this quarter than I had anticipated. While sales in our retail stores were clearly affected by economic conditions during the first quarter, our lawn business continued to show solid improvement." Anderson also stated "Based on our results so far and recognizing that we still have three-quarters of the year to go, our previous earnings projections of $1.15 to $1.30 per share for the full year still seem appropriate. This would be in line with historical averages and assumes, including a whole host of factors, that planting and growing conditions for eastern corn belt farmers this year fall somewhere within the `normal' range."

Item 12:
     The following press release was issued on July 23, 2003:
The Andersons, Inc. 480 W. Dussel Drive Maumee, Ohio 43537
, today announced second-quarter net income of $7.8 million, or $1.08 per diluted share. In the same three-month period of 2002, the company reported net income of $8.8 million, or $1.17 per diluted share. The net income and earnings per share achieved in the most recent quarter represented the company's second best quarter ever, only exceeded by the same three-month period in 2002. Total revenues of $312 million for the period were $11 million higher than the second quarter of 2002.
MAUMEE, OHIO, JULY 23, 2003The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
Net income for six months was $8.2 million, or $1.12 per diluted share, with revenues of $550 million. In comparison, net income for the first half of 2002 totaled $10.4 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, on revenues of $516 million.
The Agriculture Group's grain business experienced an operating income decline during the first two quarters this year. U.S. stocks of corn, soybeans and wheat have fallen to five-year lows following poor planting and growing conditions in 2002. As a result, demand for grain storage space softened in the first half of 2003, and fewer bushels were handled by the group's elevators, causing a reduction in gross profit from last year's record levels. The company had previously indicated that the 2003 decline was to be expected. Recently, industry analysts and the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture have indicated that there is a strong possibility that 2003 crops will produce record yields. The group's plant nutrient business achieved bottom-line improvement in both the first and second quarters this year. During the most recent three months, volume growth in industrial and specialty agricultural products, better than trend-line margins across most traditional product lines, and expense savings in a number of areas contributed to this improvement. Total
 
Agriculture Group operating income was $8.1 million in the second quarter, and stands at $8.4 million through six months.
The Rail Group's operating income of $1.4 million in the second quarter was up significantly from the same three-month period in 2002. During the period, the group continued to increase the fleet of rail equipment that it owns or manages. At mid-year, the fleet consists of 74 locomotives and more than 5,900 rail cars. Improved utilization of the fleet, with a growing number of cars in active lease service, contributed to the income growth. Although railcar values and monthly lease rates are still below historical averages, these have begun to recover somewhat. During the second quarter, the volume of business in the group's rail car repair and fabrication shops also increased significantly, contributing to the group's operating income improvement. The group also started a rail car repair business in South Carolina. The Rail Group's operating income for the first half of 2003 amounted to $1.7 million.
The Processing Group broke even in the second quarter, essentially matching its prior year results for the period. First-half operating income totaled $3.7 million, or $1.4 million better than the first half of 2002. Through six months, turf-care product sales were up about 16 percent in professional markets and 29 percent in consumer/industrial markets. However, because of product and customer mix changes and higher nitrogen ingredient costs only partially offset by price increases, gross margins were somewhat lower. Sales growth in the group's cob-based products business also contributed to the group's first-half income improvement.
The Retail Group experienced a 2 percent decline in same-store sales in the second quarter compared to the same three-month period in 2002 due to softness in the general economy, new competition in the Toledo area, and weather-related softness in sales of nursery stock. This decline was an improvement from the 8 percent drop experienced in the first quarter, however. Despite lower gross profit attributable to the drop in revenue, store operating costs were reduced in the April  June period, and operating income of $4.3 million equaled the previous year's second-quarter performance. Through six months, the group's operating income is $1.6 million.
"Our most recent quarterly performance should probably be viewed from several different perspectives," said President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson. "First, it was the second best quarter in the company's entire 56-year history. Since our best-ever quarter was in the same three-month period of 2002, however, it shows up as a year-to-year decline. The most meaningful benchmark may well be that our April  June and first half results are at the upper end of the performance track that we've projected on several previous occasions."
The company will host a webcast on Thursday, July 24, 2003 at 11:00 A.M. EDT, to discuss its second quarter performance and full-year outlook.

The following press release was issued on October 22, 2003:
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
AT THE COMPANY: GARY SMITH (419) 891 - 6417
WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 2003
, today announced a third-quarter operating loss of $2.3 million, or $0.33 per diluted share. In the same three-month period of 2002, the loss was $0.6 million, or $0.09 per diluted share. Total revenues of $253 million for the period were $48 million higher than the third quarter of 2002. Net income for the first nine months of this year was $5.0 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, with revenues of $804 million. In comparison, net income for the first nine months of 2002 totaled $11.9 million, or $1.58 per diluted share, on revenues of $721 million. These 2002 results and 2003 year-to-date performance reflect a restatement that was announced previously.
MAUMEE, OHIO, OCTOBER 22, 2003The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Agriculture Group's grain business reported increased revenues for the third quarter as a result of volume growth and higher average prices, but continued to experience an operating income decline during the period. As the company has noted previously, poor growing conditions a year ago lowered U.S. stocks of corn and soybeans, thereby reducing demand for grain storage space. The 2003 harvest is currently underway, and some industry analysts are predicting record corn production. The group's plant nutrient business achieved volume, revenue and income growth in the most recent quarter. Continued growth in industrial and specialty agricultural products along with volume and margin strength in traditional product categories contributed to these positive results. In total, the Agriculture Group experienced a $2.8 million loss for the quarter, $3 million below the $0.2 million operating income it achieved in the third quarter of 2002. Operating income through the first nine months of 2003 was $4.0 million, down $6.2 million from the prior year. The group also indicated that the previously announced negotiations to acquire the shares of Agrico Canada, Ltd. have been discontinued.
 
The Rail Group's operating income of $0.7 million in the third quarter was essentially unchanged from the same three-month period in 2002. The number of railcars and locomotives that it owns or manages continues to increase from year-earlier levels. At this time, the fleet consists of 74 locomotives and more than 6,000 rail cars. During the third quarter, the railcar repair and fabrication shops continued to contribute significantly to the group's operating income. The Rail Group's total operating income for the first nine months of 2003 amounted to $2.4 million, almost double its year-earlier performance.
The Processing Group incurred a loss of $1.1 million for the third quarter, improving slightly on its prior year performance for the period. Year-to-date operating income was $2.6 million, or $1.6 million better than the first nine months of 2002. Through September, turf-care product volumes were up approximately 14 percent in professional markets and 24 percent in consumer/industrial markets. However, because of product and customer mix changes and increased raw material costs, gross margins were somewhat lower. Sales growth in the group's cob-based products business also contributed to the group's third quarter and year-to-date income improvement.
The Retail Group achieved a 2.8 percent increase in same-store sales in the third quarter compared to the same three-month period in 2002. Average margins were down slightly, however, and expenses were somewhat higher than a year ago. As a result, the group matched its year-earlier $0.1 million operating loss for the period. Through nine months, the group's operating income was $1.6 million. This was $0.9 million below the $2.5 million it reported for the same period of 2002.
"Our third quarter results reflect the roller-coaster nature of the grain business," said President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson. "While grain storage earnings have been declining since 2002's poor crop harvests, I'm hopeful that we'll see stocks begin to rebuild this fall. Our overall performance in the third quarter was right in line with our expectations and consistent with the full-year projections we've mentioned previously. A few months ago, I indicated that we expected 2003 full-year earnings per diluted share (EPS) to come in `near the upper end of the $1.15 to $1.30 range.' Despite the restatement that raised 2002 EPS by 13 cents and reduced 2003 EPS by an equivalent amount, we're not reducing our projection for this year. We're really saying that the outlook has improved, and our expectation for total 2002  2003 earnings has increased."
The company will host a webcast on Thursday, October 23, 2003 at 11:00 A.M. EDT, to discuss its third quarter performance and full-year outlook. This can be accessed under "Financial Information" on its website at or at .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
AT THE COMPANY: Gary Smith (419) 891  6417
THE ANDERSONS, INC. REPORTS RECORD 4th QTR. EARNINGS
EPS OF $0.91 VS. $0.32 IN 2002
, today announced fourth-quarter 2003 net income of $6.7 million, or $0.91 per diluted share. In the same three-month period of 2002, the company's net income was $2.4 million, or $0.32 per diluted share. Total revenues of $443 million for the period were $88 million, or almost 25 percent, higher than the fourth quarter of 2002. Full-year net income amounted to $11.7 million, or $1.59 per diluted share. Net income for the 2002 calendar year was $14.2 million, or $1.92 per diluted share. Total revenues of $1.25 billion in the year just ended were $170 million, or 16 percent, higher than 2002.
MAUMEE, OHIO, FEBRUARY 4, 2004The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Agriculture Group's operating income of $9.8 million for the quarter was double the $4.9 million it generated a year earlier. Revenues of $363 million for the period were $84 million more than last year. The group's grain business achieved higher revenue and operating income in the fourth quarter of 2003 than in the comparable period of 2002. Its elevators took in more bushels of grain this fall as U.S. corn production reached a new record level, and the earnings generated from storing grain in the fourth quarter this year were higher than the fourth quarter of 2002. While U.S. farms set corn production records this year, corn exports increased due to higher international demand in the wake of reduced production in some countries, and U.S. carryover corn stocks are presently projected to fall to a seven-year low. As indicated in a USDA forecast issued this week,
 
these factors are expected to stimulate further growth in U.S. corn production in 2004. This would have positive implications for the group's plant nutrient business as well as its grain elevators. In 2003, the plant nutrient business posted its best-ever full-year performance although its fourth quarter income was slightly below the income it earned during the same period in 2002. Growth in industrial and specialty agricultural products along with volume and margin improvements in traditional nutrient product categories and enhanced operational efficiencies contributed to the positive full-year results. For the full-year, the group generated $13.9 million of operating income on revenues of $899 million. In 2002, income was $15.2 million and revenues amounted to $762 million.
The Rail Group's operating income of $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 was well above the $0.3 million it earned in the year-earlier three-month period. Revenues of $8.9 million for the quarter were 64 percent higher than the $5.4 realized in the comparable period of 2002. Full-year income of $4.1 million and revenues of $35.2 million also bettered 2002 performance by a wide margin. In 2002, the group had earned $1.6 million on revenues of $18.7 million. Income from the sale of railcars increased, both for the quarter and the full year, and the railcar repair and fabrication shops continued to contribute significantly to the group's operating income, establishing new full-year income records. The number of railcars and locomotives that the group either owns directly, leases, or manages for others, continued to increase during the year. At year-end, the fleet consisted of 74 locomotives and more than 6,200 railcars plus contracts to manage more than 1,200 railcars for third parties. The company is in the final stages of an acquisition that, if completed, will result in the creation of wholly-owned subsidiaries that will acquire a total of approximately 6,700 railcars and 48 locomotives plus contracts to manage an additional 3,600 railcars. This transaction is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2004. If the company is unable to complete the transaction this year, the write-off of capitalized transaction costs would negatively impact the Rail Group's 2004 earnings.
The Processing Group incurred a loss of $1.5 million during the fourth quarter, an improvement of $0.7 million from its prior-year performance for the period. Revenues of $20.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 were $0.4 million higher than the same three-month period of 2002. Full-year 2003 operating income was $1.0 million, or $2.3 million better than 2002. Revenues of $134 million for the year were $20 million more than 2002. Turf-care product volumes for the year were up approximately 15 percent in professional markets and 19 percent in consumer/industrial markets. However, because of product and customer mix changes and some increased raw material costs, average gross margins were lower. Sales growth in the group's cob-based products business also contributed to the group's full-year income improvement.
The Retail Group's sales of $50.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 represented a 0.3 percent increase in same-store sales compared to the same three-month period in 2002. For the full year, same-store sales of $179 million were down 1.4 percent. Average margins improved and expenses were relatively unchanged from a year ago. As a result, the group achieved an operating income of $1.8 million for the quarter, an improvement
 
of $0.3 million from 2002. For the full calendar year, operating income was $3.4 million in 2003, compared to $4.0 million the previous year.
"Our record fourth-quarter performance was very gratifying," said President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson. "For the past year, I've stated that we expected our 2003 earnings to fall within the $1.15 to $1.30 per share range. At the end of the third quarter, I indicated that our overall outlook was trending up. As it turned out, a number of things came together in our favor during the fourth quarter: the big corn harvest, strong year-end sales of grain, agricultural fertilizer products, rail products and services, and lawn products, plus a ten percent increase in retail sales during the key final week of the Christmas season. All of these factors contributed to the achievement of our best fourth-quarter performance ever."
"Looking ahead," Anderson added. "By the end of the first quarter, we'll know if the rail transaction has been completed, and we'll also have a more definitive read on planting prospects and nutrient demand for our region for the coming season, so I'll be in a much better position to share an earnings projection for 2004 at that time."
The company will host a webcast on Thursday, February 5, 2004 at 11:00 A.M. EST, to discuss its 2003 performance. This can be accessed under the heading "Financial Information" on its website at www.andersonsinc.com or at www.firstcallevents.com/service/ajwz397272362gf12.html.

(a) No portion of the Purchase Price or Assumed Liabilities constitutes any amount payable in respect of any Tax payable by reason of the sale, purchase, or transfer of the Purchased Assets hereunder. -30-
(b) Sellers and Buyer Parties each shall pay 50% of all transfer, sales, recording, and similar Taxes arising in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder and imposed by the United States of America, any state thereof, or any political subdivision of the United States or any such state; provided, however, that Buyer Parties shall pay 100% of any such Tax incurred as a result of Buyer Parties' failure to timely provide a sale-for-resale or other applicable exemption certificate or documentation. The parties shall cooperate to comply with all Tax return and Tax payment requirements for such Taxes, and shall provide such applicable exemption certificates and other documentation and take such other actions as may be reasonably necessary to minimize the amount of any such Taxes. If any party pays any portion of such Tax which is the responsibility of another party under this Section 7.2(b), the party responsible for the payment of such portion shall reimburse the party having made the payment upon written demand therefor, accompanied by documentation evidencing that such Tax has been paid. (c) With respect to Purchased Assets located in or based in Canada, Buyer Parties shall pay (in addition to the applicable portion of the Purchase Price) to the Seller which is selling Purchased Assets that are located in Canada (i) all Canadian federal goods and services tax ("GST") payable in respect of the sale and transfer of such Purchased Assets, (ii) all Canadian federal harmonized tax ("HST") payable in respect of the sale and transfer of such Purchased Assets, if any, situated in any of the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, and (iii) all Quebec sales tax ("QST") payable in respect of the sale and transfer of such Purchased Assets, if any, situated in the province of Quebec, it being understood that such Seller is required to collect and remit GST, HST, and QST. In addition, Buyer Parties shall provide to such Seller at Closing provincial sales tax purchase exemption certificates with respect to such Purchased Assets for each of the following provinces in which any of such Purchased Assets is situated: British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Prince Edward Island. If Buyer Parties cannot or do not provide such a certificate for any of the foregoing provinces, Buyer Parties shall pay to such Seller the amount of provincial sales tax payable in respect of the Purchased Assets located in such province. At Closing, Buyer Parties shall pay to the Escrow Agent, to be held by such Escrow Agent in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the amounts of GST, HST, QST, and provincial sales taxes calculated by such Seller on the basis of a preliminary trace of the location of the relevant Purchased Assets within one week prior to the Closing Date. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, such Seller shall determine the location of such Purchased Assets at the time of Closing, recalculate the applicable amounts of GST, HST, QST, and provincial sales taxes, and notify Buyer Parties in writing of the recalculated amount of each such tax and recalculated amount of all such taxes in the aggregate. If the aggregate amount deposited into escrow by Buyer Parties at Closing for all such taxes differs from the aggregate amount of all such taxes as so recalculated, then (i) when such Seller provides such written notification, the Escrow Agent shall be directed to refund to Buyer Parties the amount by which the aggregate amount deposited by Buyer Parties for all such taxes at Closing exceeds the aggregate amount of all such taxes as so recalculated, or (ii) on the first business day after the day of receipt of such written notification, Buyer Parties shall deposit with the Escrow Agent the amount by which the aggregate amount of all such taxes as so recalculated exceeds the aggregate amount deposited by Buyer Parties for all such taxes at Closing.

provincial sales tax) paid by Buyer Parties. At the later of (i) the time of notifying Buyer Parties of the recalculated amount of GST, HST and QST and provincial sales tax or (ii) if applicable, one business day after the date Buyer Parties deposit with the Escrow Agent (with written notice thereof to Sellers) the amount by which the aggregate amount of all such taxes as so recalculated exceeds the aggregate amount deposited by Buyer Parties at Closing, each such Seller shall provide Buyer Parties with such required documentation necessary for Buyer Parties to claim recovery of such taxes to the extent recoverable under applicable law. (d) In the case of Purchased Assets sold to Buyer Parties by Mexican Seller, Buyer Parties shall, in foreign currency (Mexican Pesos) based on the official exchange rate published in the Diario Oficial de la Federacion (Official Journal of the Federation) on the business day prior to the Closing Date, remit to Mexican Seller the Mexican value added tax ("VAT") in respect of the sale of such Purchased Assets equal to 15% of the amount of Purchase Price payable for such Purchased Assets, at least five (5) business days before the Mexican Seller is to timely remit to the appropriate governmental authorities all such VAT, it being understood that the Mexican Seller is required to collect and remit such VAT. Mexican Seller shall (as soon as practicable after Closing) provide Buyer Parties with a formal Mexican invoice, in accordance with the terms of Article 29-A of the Tax Code of the Federation, covering the corresponding amount of the Purchase Price, plus the applicable VAT. The formal Mexican invoice will reflect the dollar amount of the corresponding Purchase Price, as well as the peso amount, based on the official exchange rate published in the Diario Oficial de la Federacion (Official Journal of the Federation) on the business day prior to the date of payment of the corresponding Purchase Price. Additionally, at Closing, Mexican Seller shall provide Buyer Parties with copies of the permanent import pedimentos (declarations) as required by applicable law covering such Purchased Assets that have been imported into Mexico on a permanent basis, and such other documentation necessary for Buyer Parties to obtain recovery of such VAT, to the extent recoverable under applicable law. (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i) Sellers shall not pay, reimburse, be liable for, indemnify or hold harmless any Buyer Indemnified Party from and against any Taxes for which any lessee or other user of a Purchased Asset is liable under any of the Assumed Contracts with respect to any period (or portion thereof) commencing after the Closing, and (ii) Sellers shall be entitled to any amounts with respect to Taxes that may become payable to or for the benefit of any Seller or its Affiliates under any of the Assumed Contracts with respect to any period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date. Buyer Parties shall take any and all actions that any Seller may reasonably request, at the expense of such Seller, to permit such Seller to recover with respect to Taxes under any of the Assumed Contracts. 7.3 UMLER Designations and Restenciling. As promptly as practicable following Closing (but in no event more than 30 days from the Closing Date), Sellers shall take or cause its Affiliates to take, at Sellers' expense and with Buyer Parties' assistance as required, all necessary action to change the UMLER designation associated with the Transfer Marks so as to reflect the change in ownership of the Transfer Marks following Closing.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party agrees to provide all other parties hereto with prompt (but in no event more than 90 days from the date the party considers itself entitled to make an indemnification claim hereunder) written notice of each matter which would constitute a claim notwithstanding the applicability of the Basket (as hereafter defined) thereto. Except with respect to claims that could not exceed the Basket, as applicable, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to compromise or, if appropriate, defend at its own cost and through counsel of its own choosing, any claim or demand of any third party giving rise to such claim for indemnification. Provision of the written notice and granting of the opportunity to compromise or defend, if applicable, each as described above, shall be conditions precedent to any Indemnifying Party's obligations under this indemnity; provided, however, that failure to give such written notice shall not affect the right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent of actual prejudice to the Indemnifying Party. (ii) In the event the Indemnifying Party undertakes to compromise or defend any such claim or demand, it shall promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its intention to do so and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to limit the damages recoverable by any third party in connection therewith. The Indemnified Party shall fully cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the defense or compromise of such claim or demand. In the event the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any legal or other expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with such defense, other than reasonable out-of-pocket costs of investigation incurred prior to assumption of the defense by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at its own expense. No settlement of a third party claim or demand defended by the Indemnifying Party shall be made without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed. The Indemnifying Party shall not, except with written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed, consent to the entry of a judgment or settlement which does not include as a term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect of such third party claim or demand. -36-
(iii) In the event the Indemnifying Party does not undertake to compromise or defend any such claim or demand, the Indemnified Party shall undertake to compromise or defend any such claim or demand and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to limit the damages recoverable by any third party in connection therewith. The Indemnifying Party shall fully cooperate with the Indemnified Party and its counsel in the defense or compromise of such claim or demand. The Indemnifying Party may participate in such defense at its own expense; provided that the Indemnified Party does not reasonably object thereto. No settlement of a third party claim or demand defended by the Indemnified Party shall be made without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed. The Indemnified Party shall not, except with written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed, consent to the entry of a judgment or settlement which does not include as a term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnifying Party of a release from all liability in respect of such third party claim or demand. (b) Direct Claims. (i) In connection with any Dispute directly between the parties hereto, each party hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such Dispute. Each Indemnifying Party covenants and agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cure any matter caused by such party giving rise to the applicable Dispute and each Indemnified Party covenants and agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses incurred by such party related to such Dispute. Furthermore, each Indemnified Party shall, subject to clause (ii) hereof, as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than 90 days from the date the party considers itself entitled to make an indemnification claim hereunder) notify, in writing, the Indemnifying Party, setting forth the nature of the claim or demand in detail. If the parties are unable to agree upon a resolution of any Dispute within 60 days of receipt by the Indemnifying Party of a written notice of a Dispute, they shall each require members of their management teams or other relevant personnel to participate in a face-to-face meeting in a mutually convenient location selected by agreement of the parties, or failing such agreement, in St. Louis, Missouri, in an effort to resolve the Dispute. The face-to-face meeting, if any, shall occur within 90 days of receipt of a written notice of a Dispute and if any party thereto determines that further negotiations between the parties would not be useful, the parties shall resolve the matter in accordance with Section 8.7, if applicable, or by means of a Governmental Authority, if desired. (ii) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Buyer Indemnified Parties may not bring a cause of action in or through any Governmental Authority against any Seller Indemnified Party or seek resolution of any Dispute in accordance with Section 8.7, until the cumulative unresolved maximum amount of Losses incurred by all Buyer Indemnified Parties equals or exceeds $250,000; provided, however, if the cumulative unresolved maximum amount of Losses incurred by all Buyer Indemnified Parties does not equal or exceed $250,000 in any one year following the initial anniversary of the Closing Date and any successive anniversary -37-
thereof, the Buyer Indemnified Parties may nevertheless institute such a claim not more than once per year. (c) With respect to any claim by Buyer Parties for indemnification under Section 8.2(a) based upon a claim that (i) Sellers breached the representation and warranty contained in Section 3.7(a) as a result of, and solely as a result of, failure by Sellers to sell, transfer, convey and deliver to Buyers good and marketable title to a Conveyed Unit set forth on Schedule 3.7(C) on the Closing Date or (ii) as of the Closing Date, an Event of Loss occurred with respect to any Conveyed Unit (each a "SLV Event"), then in each case, the measure of damages with respect to each affected Conveyed Unit shall be the Stipulated Loss Value of such Conveyed Unit. At such time as Schedule 3.7(C) shall be updated as of the Closing Date in accordance with Section 2.4, Schedule 8.4(c) shall be updated to reflect the Stipulated Loss Value of each new railcar and locomotive added to Schedule 3.7(C). Notwithstanding any other time periods for notice and resolution provided in this Section 8.4 for indemnification procedures, but subject to the limitations set forth in the last sentence of Section 8.5, the parties shall within ten (10) business days after the Closing Date, cooperate with each other to confirm the existence of facts that would give rise to any claim based upon an SLV Event. In the event both parties confirm and agree upon the existence of facts that would give rise to any claim based upon an SLV Event, the parties hereto shall cooperate in an attempt to cure and mitigate the same for an amount less than the applicable Stipulated Loss Value, if practical or possible, or if such is not practical or possible, within ten (10) business days after such joint determination, Sellers shall pay to Buyers the Stipulated Loss Value of the affected Conveyed Unit. Without limiting the applicability of the Stipulated Loss Value being the appropriate measure of damages for any claim based upon an SLV Event, any dispute between the parties regarding the matters referenced above shall be determined in accordance with the remaining provisions set forth in this Article VIII. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall limit Buyers' right to indemnification based upon an SLV Event at any time during the applicable indemnification survival period set forth in Section 8.1(b). 8.5 De Minimis Exclusion; Maximum Liability. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Sellers shall not be obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties, and the Andersons shall not be obligated to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article VIII unless and until the amount of all Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties, or by the Sellers Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, exceeds $1,000,000 in the aggregate (the "Basket"), in which event the party seeking indemnity may recover all Losses incurred in excess of the Basket from the first dollar above the Basket, and (ii) Sellers' maximum liability for Losses, in the absence of fraud, under Section 8.2 shall be 50% of the Purchase Price and the Andersons' maximum liability for Losses, in the absence of fraud, under Section 8.3 shall be 50% of the Purchase Price (in each case, the "Maximum Indemnity Amount"). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything contained herein to the contrary, neither the Basket nor the Maximum Indemnity Amount set forth above in this Section 8.5, shall apply to any indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 8.2(b), 8.2(c), 8.2(d), 8.2(e), 8.3(b) and 8.3(c) or to any indemnification obligations of Sellers as a result of a breach of the Title Representation; provided, however, (i) no Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to indemnify an Indemnified Party in connection with the matters referenced in this sentence unless and until the amount of all Losses incurred by the Indemnified Party exceeds $25,000 in the aggregate, in which event the Indemnified Party may recover all Losses including the initial $25,000, and (ii) Sellers' -38-
maximum liability for all Losses for a breach of the Title Representation, in the absence of fraud, shall be 100% of the Purchase Price. 8.6 Offsets. The obligation of an Indemnifying Party to indemnify against any claim or demand under this Article VIII shall be reduced by any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party with respect to such claim or demand or the underlying facts under insurance policies, net of any increase that will occur, or is reasonably likely to occur, in insurance premiums payable by the Indemnified Party, whether by retrospective premium adjustments or any other premium increase under the policy or policies under which the claim is made or any other policy, where the increase results directly from filing the insurance claim; provided, however, that this Section 8.6 shall apply only if this provision does not constitute an improper waiver of the insurer's rights of subrogation against the Indemnifying Party. Subject to Section 7.7, nothing contained in this Section 8.6 shall be deemed to create an obligation of any party hereto to maintain any form or level of insurance after the Closing, to name any other party as an additional insured or to obtain approval for any waiver of rights of subrogation. 8.7 Dispute Resolution. Subject to Section 8.4(b)(ii), if the consolidated, maximum amount that claimants are seeking with respect to any disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement (each, a "Dispute") does not exceed $2,000,000 (and if the claimants are not seeking equitable relief), the parties agree to settle such Dispute by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, as follows: (a) Each of the parties shall attempt, in good faith, to agree upon a single impartial and independent arbitrator to conduct a final and binding arbitration with respect to the Dispute. If the parties are unable to agree on the selection of a single arbitrator, each shall choose an impartial and independent arbitrator, each of which shall agree on a selection of a third impartial and independent arbitrator, and the three arbitrators thus selected shall resolve the Dispute as herein provided. Each arbitrator shall be familiar with the railroad industry and shall have, to the extent practicable, substantial experience in the financial, business or legal issues which are the subject of, or implicated in, the Dispute. The parties consent to a single, consolidated arbitration for all Disputes for which arbitration is permitted. Any arbitration under this Section 8.7 shall be conducted in a mutually convenient location selected by agreement of the parties, or failing such agreement, in St. Louis, Missouri. (b) The parties shall utilize their commercially reasonable efforts to conclude any arbitration within 180 days after the demand for arbitration has been submitted to the American Arbitration Association. (c) Each party shall be permitted to present its case, witnesses and evidence (including deposition testimony), if any, in the presence of the other parties. A written transcript of the proceedings shall be made and furnished to the parties. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the tribunal shall determine the Dispute in accordance with the substantive, procedural and evidentiary laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any conflict of law rules or other rules that might render such law inapplicable or unavailable, and shall apply -39-
this Agreement according to its terms; provided, however, that any award of the tribunal may not exceed the remedies available to the prevailing party were the Dispute to be litigated in a state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware (except that paragraph (e) of this Section will be given full force and effect notwithstanding this proviso). The tribunal (in the event of a panel of three arbitrators, a majority of the panel) shall render a written award on the Dispute by majority vote accompanied by a reasoned decision as soon as practicable after the closing of the hearing. The tribunal has no authority with respect to any matter in which the claim exceeds $2,000,000 and, accordingly, is without jurisdiction to enter an award in excess of $2,000,000. (d) The parties agree to be bound by any award or order resulting from any arbitration conducted hereunder and further agree that judgment on any award or order resulting from an arbitration conducted under this Section 8.7 may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over any of the parties or any of their assets. (e) The costs of any arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the arbitrators, shall be borne as determined by the arbitrator or arbitrators. Each party to this Agreement shall bear the expense of its own counsel, experts, witnesses, and preparation and presentation of proofs, except to the extent such expenses constitute "Losses" that are eligible for indemnification hereunder. 8.8 Exclusive Remedies. After the Closing, absent fraud, the parties' sole and exclusive recourse against each other for any Loss or claim of Losses arising out of or relating to this Agreement and any other agreement or instrument executed in connection herewith or pursuant hereto (other than the License Agreement, Employee Lease Agreement, Railcar Mark Usage Agreement, Transition Agreement, Storage Agreement and Consent to Public Announcement, dated January 30, 2004, by and between PRSC, Railcar and the Andersons) shall be expressly limited and subject to the provisions of this Article VIII. Sellers hereby covenant and agree for the benefit of Buyers that they will not institute against any Buyer, any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings or other similar proceeding under the laws of the United States, any state of the United States or any foreign jurisdiction. 8.9 Guaranties and Information. The obligations of Sellers under this Article VIII shall be guaranteed by Progress Fuels Corporation, a Florida corporation and parent of Sellers, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Parent Guaranty. Sellers shall deliver to Buyer Parties on or before the Closing annual financial statements of Progress Fuels Corporation for the three most recent fiscal years. Within four months after the end of each of the three succeeding fiscal years of PRSC following Closing and thereafter annually upon request of Buyer Parties, Sellers shall deliver an annual financial statement of PRSC for the immediately preceding fiscal year so long as the Parent Guaranty remains in effect. In the event and only in the event the Andersons is no longer subject to the public reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for so long as the Andersons has indemnification obligations hereunder, upon written request of Sellers, the Andersons shall deliver to Sellers, within four months after the end of each fiscal year following Closing, an annual financial statement of the Andersons for the immediately preceding fiscal year. ARTICLE IX TERMINATION -40-
9.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned at any time, prior to the Closing only as follows: (a) by mutual written consent of the parties hereto; (b) by Buyer Parties or Sellers if the Closing Date shall not have occurred on or before February 16, 2004 or such later date upon which the parties shall mutually agree in writing (provided that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or has resulted in, the failure of the Closing Date to occur on or before such date); (c) by Buyer Parties or Sellers, if any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or other Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated hereby and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable; or (d) by either Sellers or Buyer Parties if the other party is subject to voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings and such proceedings are not dismissed within thirty (30) days from the date of such proceedings or agrees to sell all or substantially all of its assets to its creditors or other similar adjudication or petition is made or entered under any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency or other similar Law; 9.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1 and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, all further obligations of the parties under or pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate without further liability of either party to the other; provided, however, the obligations contained in this Section 9.2, Section 5.7, and Article X of this Agreement shall survive any such termination. Nothing contained in this Section 9.2 shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of this Agreement. ARTICLE X MISCELLANEOUS 10.1 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except by an instrument in writing signed by all of the parties. 10.2 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing, the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth on an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party and any waiver shall only act with respect to the specific matter waived and shall not be deemed a continuing waiver. -41-
10.3 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the documents referred to herein and to be delivered pursuant hereto and in connection herewith constitute the entire agreement between the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions of the parties, whether oral or written, and there are no warranties, representations or other agreements between the parties in connection with the subject matter hereof, except as specifically described above. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that this Agreement supercedes, in its entirety, the Asset Purchase Agreement which is terminated and of no further force or effect. 10.4 Expenses. Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, each of the parties hereto shall pay the fees and expenses of their respective counsel, investment bankers, financial advisors, accountants and other experts and the other expenses incident to the negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition, Buyer Parties, on one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall pay one-half of the cost of the Lien search reports and related legal opinions referenced in Section 6.2(h), however, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the cost of resolving any issues necessary for Sellers to deliver the Purchased Assets to Buyer Parties free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens shall be borne by Sellers. 10.5 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted according to the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the conflicts of law rules thereof. 10.6 Assignment. This Agreement and Sellers' rights hereunder may not be assigned by Sellers at any time without the prior written consent of Buyer Parties, and any such attempt shall be null and void. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.11 of this Agreement, each Seller hereby acknowledges that in addition to the possible assignment contemplated in Section 6.2(n), that Buyer Parties intend to convey the Purchased Assets and assign all of their right, title and interest in, to and under this Agreement to one or more purchasers contemplated by the Buyer Financing, each of which will hold certain of the Purchased Assets promptly following the Closing (each a "Financing Purchaser") and to one or more purchasers not associated with the Buyer Financing which will also hold certain of the Purchased Assets promptly following the Closing (the "Direct Purchasers") and each Seller hereby agrees that each such Financing Purchaser and Direct Purchaser and any assignee thereof that acquires or has pledged to it all or substantially all of the assets of such Financing Purchaser or Direct Purchaser (each a "Significant Assignee"), as the case may be, and any beneficiary or other person claiming an interest through any such Financing Purchaser, Direct Purchaser or Significant Assignee, shall be a permitted assign of Buyer Parties' rights hereunder and may exercise the rights of Buyer Parties hereunder and be entitled to all of the benefits of Buyer Parties hereunder to the extent of such conveyance and/or assignment; provided, however, notwithstanding any such assignment Buyer Parties shall remain obligated hereunder. Buyer Parties agree to promptly notify Sellers in writing in the event that any person or entity other than or in addition to the Andersons will be managing indemnification claims against Sellers pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that failure to give such notice shall not affect the right hereunder to indemnification of Buyer Parties or their assigns. 10.7 Notices. All communications, notices and disclosures required or permitted by this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given when delivered -42-

Sellers and Buyer Parties are parties to that certain Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of January 30, 2004 (the "Asset Purchase Agreement"). B. The parties desire to further amend the Asset Purchase Agreement on the terms and conditions set forth herein. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: 1. Cap Acquire Canada ULC. The parties hereto acknowledge that Canadian Buyer's legal existence did not begin until February 3, 2004 and, accordingly, the Asset Purchase Agreement was not effective with respect to Canadian Buyer. Canadian Buyer by its execution of this Amendment, hereby becomes party to the Asset Purchase Agreement as of the date of its formation. 2. Amendments. The Asset Purchase Agreement is hereby amended as follows: (a) Exhibit F shall be deleted and the "List of Exhibits" shall be amended to delete the term "Escrow Agreement" set forth opposite the text "Exhibit F" on such page, and shall be replaced with the text "[Intentionally omitted]". (b) The definitions of "Escrow Agent" and "Escrow Agreement" are hereby deleted from Article I.
(c) The following sentence shall be inserted at the end of Section 2.1: "All Purchased Assets acquired by Canadian Buyer will be acquired only from Canadian Seller." (d) The third sentence of Section 2.4 is hereby modified by deleting therefrom the words "one business day prior to the Closing Date" and inserting in lieu thereof "two (2) business days prior to the Closing Date." (e) There shall be inserted in Article III a new Section 3.23, as follows: "3.23 Income Tax Act (Canada). Canadian Seller is not a non-resident of Canada for purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) and any applicable provincial taxing laws." (f) The first sentence of Section 5.9(b) shall be amended by deleting the words "as of the business day before Closing" and inserting in lieu thereof the words "as of the second business day before Closing." (g) Section 6.1(l) is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows: "(l) [Intentionally omitted];" (h) Section 6.3(j) is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows: "(j) Sellers shall have received all payments, exemption certificates and other applicable documentation to be provided by Buyer Parties on the Closing Date pursuant to Section 7.2; and" (i) Section 7.2(c) is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows: "(c) With respect to Purchased Assets located in or based in Canada, Buyer Parties shall pay (in addition to the applicable portion of the Purchase Price) to the Seller which is selling Purchased Assets that are located in Canada (i) all Canadian federal goods and services tax ("GST") payable in respect of the sale and transfer of such Purchased Assets, (ii) all Canadian federal harmonized tax ("HST") payable in respect of the sale and transfer of such Purchased Assets, if any, situated in any of the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, and (iii) all Quebec sales tax ("QST") payable in respect of the sale and transfer of such Purchased Assets, if any, situated in the province of Quebec, it being understood that such Seller is required to collect and remit GST, HST, and QST. In addition, Buyer Parties shall provide to such Seller at Closing provincial sales tax purchase exemption certificates with respect to such Purchased Assets for each of the following
provinces in which any of such Purchased Assets is situated: British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Prince Edward Island. If Buyer Parties cannot or do not provide such a certificate for any of the foregoing provinces, Buyer Parties shall pay to such Seller the amount of provincial sales tax payable in respect of the Purchased Assets located in such province. At Closing, Buyer Parties shall pay to the applicable Seller, in foreign currency (Canadian Dollars) based on the official exchange rate published on the business day prior to the Closing Date, the amounts of GST, HST, QST, and provincial sales taxes calculated by such Seller on the basis of a preliminary trace of the location of the relevant Purchased Assets within one week prior to the Closing Date. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but in no event later than fifteen (15) business days following the Closing Date, such Seller shall determine the location of such Purchased Assets at the time of Closing, recalculate the applicable amounts of GST, HST, QST, and provincial sales taxes, and notify Buyer Parties in writing of the recalculated amount of each such tax and recalculated amount of all such taxes in the aggregate. If the aggregate amount paid by Buyer Parties at Closing for all such taxes differs from the aggregate amount of all such taxes as so recalculated, then (i) when such Seller provides such written notification, such Seller shall refund to Buyer Parties, in foreign currency (Canadian Dollars) based on the official exchange rate published on the business day prior to the Closing Date, the amount by which the aggregate amount paid by Buyer Parties for all such taxes at Closing exceeds the aggregate amount of all such taxes as so recalculated, or (ii) on the first business day after the day of receipt of such written notification, Buyer Parties shall pay to such Seller, in foreign currency (Canadian Dollars) based on the official exchange rate published on the business day prior to the Closing Date, the amount by which the aggregate amount of all such taxes as so recalculated exceeds the aggregate amount paid by Buyer Parties for all such taxes at Closing. At the later of (i) the time of notifying Buyer Parties of the recalculated amount of GST, HST and QST and provincial sales tax or (ii) if applicable, one business day after the date Buyer Parties pay to Sellers the amount by which the aggregate amount of all such taxes as so recalculated exceeds the aggregate amount paid by Buyer Parties at Closing, each such Seller shall provide Buyer Parties with such required documentation necessary for Buyer Parties to claim recovery of such taxes to the extent recoverable under applicable law." (j) Section 7.2(d) is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows: "(d) In the case of Purchased Assets sold to Buyer Parties by Mexican Seller, Buyer Parties shall, on the Closing Date, in foreign currency (Mexican Pesos) based on the official exchange rate published in the Diario Oficial de la Federacion (Official Journal of the Federation) on the business day prior to the Closing Date, pay to Mexican Seller the Mexican value added tax ("VAT") in respect of the sale of such Purchased Assets equal to 15% of the amount of Purchase Price payable for such Purchased Assets, it being understood that the Mexican Seller is required to collect and remit such VAT. Mexican

TOP CAT Holding is a newly formed Limited Liability Company (LLC) in which The Andersons is the sole equity investor.

Mike Anderson, President and CEO of The Andersons, says the acquisition presents a good opportunity for The Andersons to grow within its core competencies. "Our Rail Group brings more than a decade of railcar leasing and management expertise to this venture. That experience combined with an upward trend in the railcar market makes this a very good fit for us. The newly acquired fleet, when added to our current fleet holdings, positions The Andersons among the top railcar leasing companies in the nation."

Item 2: Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
As previously reported by The Andersons, Inc. (the "Company") in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 27, 2004, the Company completed its acquisition of certain railroad rolling stock and leasing assets from Railcar, Ltd. and Progress Rail Services Corp., both of which are part of Progress Energy, Inc. (NYSE:PGN) The assets were acquired for cash of approximately $82.4 million and funding was provided through the issuance of $86.4 million in non-recourse notes securitized by the acquired assets.
This Current Report on Form 8-K/A is being filed to amend the February 27, 2004 Form 8-K in which we stated that we intended to file additional financial information about the transaction as required by Item 7 of Form 8-K. An audit of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and statement of revenue and direct expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 was completed. The results of the audit demonstrated that the transaction's assets and excess of direct expenses over revenue were less than 20% of the Company's assets and pretax income from continuing operations, respectively, and financial statements are therefore not required to be filed.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 12:
The following press release was issued on May 5, 2004:
, today reported a first quarter loss of $0.2 million, or three cents per diluted share. In the same three-month period of 2003, the company incurred a loss of $0.5 million, or seven cents per diluted share. Total revenues of $275 million for the period were $36 million higher than the first quarter of 2003.
MAUMEE, OHIO, MAY 5, 2004-The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Agriculture Group incurred an operating loss of $1.5 million for the quarter. In the comparable three-month period of 2003, the group lost $1.0 million. Revenues of $184 million in this year's first quarter were $34 million higher than a year ago. First quarter revenues in the group's grain business were higher this year due to higher average grain prices and increased volume. Grain gross profit and operating income were both slightly below first quarter 2003 levels. Total tonnage and revenues in the group's plant nutrient business increased somewhat from the prior year during the first quarter. Expenses were moderately higher, however, and the plant nutrient bottom line declined slightly. With carryover stocks of corn in the U.S. projected to drop to their lowest level in several years and currently high grain market prices, planted acres and total corn production on U.S. farms are expected to increase this season. This points toward good fertilizer sales this spring and a large grain harvest in the fall, assuming reasonably good weather during the growing season.
The Rail Group's first quarter performance outpaced 2003's first quarter. Total revenues of $11.1 million were up $6.7 million for the period, and operating income of $1.3 million was $1.0 million above last year. The group completed several railcar financing transactions during the quarter and midway through the period finalized the previously announced acquisition of a large number of railcars and locomotives. This transaction more than doubled the size of the group's fleet and positioned it among the major rail leasing companies in North America.
Table of Contents
The Processing Group's first quarter 2004 operating income of $3.2 million was $0.5 million below the amount it earned in the same period last year. Total revenues of $45.2 million for the quarter were $7.2 million below the 2003 first quarter level. Most of the group's lawn products income is typically generated during the first quarter each year as retailers, golf course superintendents and landscapers get ready for springtime business. This year, first quarter sales were lower due to the volume of carryover inventories held by retailers and some shipments that occurred late in 2003 which normally would have happened in January of 2004. In addition, sales to professional markets were hampered by the cold weather which delayed the season's start for many lawn care operators.
The Retail Group's sales of $34.6 million in the first quarter represented a robust 8.2 percent increase in same-store sales compared to the same three-month period in 2003. While the average amount of each customer's purchase increased slightly, most of the $2.6 million increase in the group's total revenue was attributable to growth in the number of customers served. Average margins were relatively unchanged for the period. Because of the resultant increase in total gross profit, the group's operating performance improved by $0.3 million.
The Andersons' consolidated balance sheet grew noticeably during the first quarter, primarily due to the rail acquisition that added approximately $90 million to the company's total assets and $86.4 million of non-recourse debt securitized by the rail assets purchased.
"We're off to a reasonably good start this year, and things appear to be positioned pretty well for the important spring season," said President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson. "Corn acreage projections look promising, and we believe that strong grain prices will encourage average or better agricultural fertilizer use this season. We're getting indications of good spring activity in our stores' lawn and garden business, and we're also encouraged by the early results from our big rail acquisition."
Anderson also stated "At this juncture, I believe that our 2004 full-year EPS could be in the $1.40 to $1.65 range. It's still early, though, and numerous factors could go either way. My point is simply that forecasting future results in our diverse businesses is imprecise at best. I will update this forecast as we go through the year."
The company will host a webcast on Thursday, May 6, 2004 at 11:00 A.M. EST, to discuss its first quarter performance and full-year outlook.

Item 12:
The following press release was issued on August 4, 2004:
, today announced that its net income and earnings per share in the most recent three-month period were the best quarterly performance in the company's history. For the second quarter of 2004, The Andersons achieved net income of $10.1 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, compared to net income of $7.8 million and earnings per diluted share of $1.07 that it reported for the same three-month period of 2003. Total revenues of $376 million for the period were $64 million higher than the second quarter of 2003. For the first half of 2004, the company's net income was $9.8 million, or $1.31 per diluted share, on revenues of $651 million. In the first six months of last year, The Andersons earned $7.3 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, on revenues of $551 million.
MAUMEE, OHIO, AUGUST 4, 2004The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Agriculture Group achieved an operating income of $10.9 million for the quarter. In the second quarter of 2003, the group earned $7.9 million. Revenues of $268 million in this year's second quarter were $60 million higher than a year ago. Second quarter revenues and gross profit in the group's grain business were higher this year due to higher average grain prices, increased storage income and a greater number of bushels sold. The recently acquired elevator in Oakville, Indiana and increased investment in Lansing Grain LLC also contributed to the grain income improvement. The number of tons sold during the second quarter by the group's plant nutrient business increased from the prior year. Total revenues also increased due to higher raw material costs. However, average gross margins were somewhat lower, and plant nutrient income was down slightly from the second quarter of last year. The Agriculture Group's operating income for the first six months of 2004 amounted to $9.4 million, an increase of $2.5 million from the first half of 2003. Total revenues of $452 million for the six-month period were $95 million higher than a year ago. At this point in the agricultural growing season, the outlook for this year's corn crop is very good. In fact, the USDA is predicting that U.S. farms will see record yields this fall.
The Rail Group's second quarter income again outpaced its prior year performance. Operating income of $2.1 million in the second quarter this year was $0.7 million higher than the same three-month period of 2003. Total revenues of $13.1 million were $0.5 million higher than last year. The large acquisition of rail equipment, related leases and
Table of Contents
management contracts that the group announced midway through the first quarter contributed to the strong second quarter performance. Through the first six months of 2004, the group has achieved operating income of $3.3 million on revenues of $24.2 million. In the first half of last year, income was $1.7 million on revenues of $17.1 million.
The Processing Group generated revenues of $40.0 million in the second quarter of 2004 and operating income of $1.0 million. In 2003, the group incurred a slight operating loss during the period on revenues of $37.1 million. The strongest sales period for lawn products manufacturers typically occurs in the first calendar quarter each year. The second quarter then consists primarily of refill orders from retailers and distributors. This year the Processing Group's lawn business, which had experienced a weather-related decline in its first quarter results, more than recouped this income shortfall during the second quarter. Increased volumes in some markets and mix-related gains in average gross margins fueled this improvement. Through the first six months of 2004, the group has achieved operating income of $4.2 million on $85.3 million of revenues. First half income last year was $3.7 million, and revenues amounted to $89.6 million. Noting recent escalation in some energy-related raw material costs, the company indicated that the Processing Group may not duplicate last year's better than normal second half performance.
The Retail Group's sales of $54.5 million in the second quarter matched the same three-month period in 2003. Both the number of customers served and the average amount of each customer's purchase were almost identical to the levels experienced last year. Average margins were impacted, however, by weak lawn and garden sales, the result of unusually cool and wet weather throughout most of the spring. Lawn and garden is typically a major product category in the group's stores during the spring season. Through the first half of this year, the group has earned operating income of $1.4 million, or $0.3 million less than it did during the first six months of 2003. Total revenues to-date through June were $89.1 million, 3 percent above last year.
"Achieving our best-ever quarterly performance has really been gratifying," said President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson. "It's an accomplishment made possible by the dedication, hard work and infectious enthusiasm demonstrated by employees throughout the company. Despite worrisome energy costs, rising interest rates and continued escalation in health care expenses, conditions in several of our businesses are generally improving, and I now believe that our earnings per share for the year could exceed the upper end of the range we had projected at the end of the first quarter. While forecasting future results in our diverse businesses is not precise, I now believe that the company's 2004 full-year earnings could be within the range of $1.65 to $1.90 per share."

The Andersons, Inc. 480 W. Dussel Drive Maumee, Ohio 43537
WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 2004
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE            AT THE COMPANY: Gary Smith (419) 891-6417
, today announced that its net income and earnings per share in the most recent three-month period were the best third-quarter performance in the company's history. For the period, The Andersons achieved net income of $1.0 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, compared to the net loss of $2.3 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, that it experienced in the third quarter of 2003. Total revenues of $251 million for the period were $2 million below the third quarter of last year. For nine months to-date, the company's net income was $10.9 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, on revenues of $902 million. In the first nine months of last year, The Andersons earned $5.0 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, on revenues of $804 million.
MAUMEE, OHIO, NOVEMBER 3, 2004  The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Agriculture Group achieved an operating income of $0.3 million for the quarter. In the third quarter of 2003, the group incurred an operating loss of $2.8 million. Revenues of $169 million in this year's third quarter were $9 million lower than a year ago. Third quarter revenues in the group's grain business were lower this year because of fewer bushels sold during the period. However, increased bushel receipts and higher average gross margins fueled gross profit growth and income improvement. The group's plant nutrient business also achieved gross profit and operating income improvement in the third quarter with increased fertilizer shipments and higher average gross margins. The Agriculture Group's operating income for the first nine months of 2004 amounted to $9.7 million, an increase of $5.6 million from the same period in 2003. Total revenues of $622 million for the nine-month period were $86 million higher than a year ago. At this time, the fall harvest is in full swing, and the USDA is predicting that U.S. farmers will realize record corn and soybean yields and production totals. The company also indicated that it is evaluating the possibility of investing in an ethanol production facility at one of several possible locations in its region.

The Rail Group's July  September 2004 performance far outpaced its prior year results. Operating income of $4.9 million in the third quarter this year was $4.2 million higher than the same three-month period of 2003. Total revenues of $19.4 million were $10.1 million higher than last year. Continued improvement in lease rates during the period contributed to this strong performance as did a $2.5 million year-to-year increase in gross profit on car sales. Through the first nine months of 2004, the group has achieved operating income of $8.2 million on revenues of $43.6 million. In the same period last year, income was $2.4 million on $26.3 million of revenues.
The Processing Group incurred an operating loss of $1.9 million in the third quarter this year. This was $0.7 million higher than the operating loss experienced in the same three-month period of 2003. Total revenues of $20.8 million were $2.7 million below last year. The third quarter is typically a loss period for this group's highly seasonal lawn fertilizer business. Through the first nine months of 2004, the group has achieved operating income of $2.4 million on $106 million of revenues. In the first nine months last year, the group had earned $2.6 million, and revenues amounted to $113 million. Although average gross margins have improved this year due to product mix improvements, volumes declined somewhat because of unfavorable weather patterns during the important lawn and garden season this spring. Noting recent escalation in some energy-related raw material costs, the company indicated that the Processing Group may also fall short of last year's better than normal fourth quarter volume and profitability levels.
The Retail Group's sales of $41.1 million in the third quarter were 1.9 percent below the same three-month period in 2003. Food-related product categories continued to achieve growth vs. prior-year levels, but home center products, especially lawn and garden categories, were down. In addition, labor and utility costs were higher than a year ago. As a result, the group's operating loss widened from $0.1 million in 2003, to $0.2 million in the third quarter this year. Through the first nine months of the year, the group has earned operating income of $1.2 million, or $0.4 million less than it did during the same period of 2003. Total revenues for the Retail Group year-to-date through September are $130 million, 1.4 percent above last year.
"The third quarter has traditionally been a loss period because of the seasonality in several of our businesses, so achieving net income in excess of a million dollars in the third quarter this year is gratifying," said President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson. "During the quarter, when we saw that the Rail and Agriculture businesses were exceeding our performance expectations, we revised our full-year earnings per diluted share guidance upward. Now in the first week of November, the harvest is progressing well, fall fertilizer sales look promising, and the rail business remains strong. Although lawn fertilizer raw material costs have escalated and retail sales remain soft, I believe that the $1.80 to $2.05 full-year earnings guidance we issued in September is still appropriate."

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE            AT THE COMPANY: Gary Smith (419) 891  6417 WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 2005
, today announced fourth-quarter 2004 net income of $8.3 million, or $1.09 per diluted share. In the same three-month period of 2003, the company's net income was $6.7 million, or $0.91 per diluted share. Full-year net income amounted to $19.1 million, or $2.55 per diluted share. In 2003, the company's net income was $11.7 million, or $1.59 per diluted share. Total revenues were $374 million for the fourth quarter this year compared to $443 million a year ago. Full-year revenues of $1.28 billion in the year just ended were $28 million higher than 2003.
MAUMEE, OHIO, FEBRUARY 9, 2005The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Agriculture Group's fourth-quarter and full-year results both established new income performance records. Operating income was $11.6 million for the quarter, $1.8 million higher than the $9.8 million the group generated a year earlier. Full-year operating income in 2004 was $21.3 million. This was $7.4 million above the $13.9 million achieved in 2003. Revenues of $288 million for the fourth quarter this year were $75 million below last year primarily due to lower average grain prices. Full-year revenues of $909 million were $10 million higher than the previous year. Record corn and soybean production in the U.S. this year enabled the group's elevators to achieve strong earnings from grain storage in the fourth quarter of 2004, and full-year grain space income was the highest it's been in three years. Operating income in the group's plant nutrient business this year was its second best year ever. As a result of tonnage growth of more than 10% and price increases in certain products, revenues increased significantly. Average gross margins were slightly lower than the prior year. During the year, the Agriculture Group acquired an elevator in Oakville, Indiana, continued to benefit from its investment in Lansing Grain, a grain trading company, and sold two underperforming farm centers. The group has also been evaluating the possibility of investing in ethanol production facilities in its region.
The Rail Group's operating income of $2.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 was $1.1 million above the $1.7 million it earned in the year-earlier three-month period. Revenues of $15.7 million for the quarter were 76 percent higher than the $8.9 generated in the comparable period of 2003. Full-year income of $11.0 million and revenues of $59.3 million also exceeded 2003 results by a wide margin. In 2003, the group had earned $4.1 million on revenues of $35.2 million. Contributing to the group's significant income growth in 2004 was a large acquisition made early in the year. This transaction dramatically increased the number of railcars the group owns directly, leases, or manages for others throughout North America and improved the group's overall operating efficiency.
The Processing Group typically incurs an operating loss during the fourth quarter. This year the loss amounted to $2.5 million, on revenues of $21.7 million. During the same three-month period in 2003, the group's operating loss was $1.5 million, with revenues of $20.9 million. In the most recent three-month period, turf-care product volumes were up slightly but were offset by higher employment-related costs and other non-recurring realignment charges. For the full calendar year, turf-care product volumes were lower, and the group incurred an operating loss of $0.1 million, or $1.1 million below the $1.0 million operating income it achieved in 2003. Full-year revenues of $128 million in 2004 were $6 million below last year. Margin pressure in the group's cob-based products business also contributed to the decline in the group's operating income. In response to these conditions, the group has closed a lawn products manufacturing operation in Pennsylvania and has reduced certain sales, general and administrative expenses. It has also reduced year-end inventories of turf-care products by 23 percent versus 2003.
The Retail Group reported revenues of $48.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, a 3.3 percent decrease in same-store sales compared to the same three-month period in 2003. Sales of $179 million for the full year were flat compared to the group's 2003 experience. Customer counts and average gross margins were also relatively unchanged, but expenses increased versus 2003, both for the quarter and the full year. As a result, the group achieved an operating income of $0.9 million for the quarter, about $0.9 million below the prior year. For the full calendar year, operating income was $2.1 million in 2004, compared to $3.4 million in 2003. It was noted that competitors had opened several new stores in the group's region during the past year, especially in the Lima and Toledo, Ohio market areas.
"All considered, our overall performance in 2004 was very gratifying," said President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson. "Agriculture and Rail both posted exceptional results, the company set new earnings records, for the quarter as well as the year, and cash provided by operating activities has been very strong. We were able to achieve these results in spite of unusually high energy prices, continued escalation in health care costs, and a huge investment in terms of employees' time and significant external expenditures that we incurred in connection with the initial year of the new Sarbanes-Oxley regulations."
The company will host a webcast on Thursday, February 10, 2005 at 10:00 A.M. EST, to discuss its 2004 performance. This can be accessed under the heading "Financial Information" on its website at .

Maumee, Ohio 43537
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE            AT THE COMPANY: Gary Smith (419) 891  6417 WEDNESDAY, MAY 4, 2005
, today announced first-quarter 2005 net income of $1.0 million, or $0.14 per diluted share. This was an improvement of $1.2 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, from the first quarter of 2004 when the company lost $0.2 million, or $0.03 per diluted share. Total revenues were $259 million for the first quarter this year compared to $275 million a year ago. The reduction in revenues was attributed to lower average grain prices, as noted below. Included in the company's first-quarter 2005 results is an after-tax charge of $0.4 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, to correct pension and post-retirement benefit valuation errors over the past four years. The entire correction was made in the first quarter of 2005 on the basis that it is not material to the current or prior periods.
MAUMEE, OHIO, MAY 4, 2005The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Agriculture Group's first-quarter performance exceeded the two previous years. Operating income was $1.0 million for the quarter, $2.5 million higher than the $1.5 million loss the group incurred a year ago. Revenues of $165 million for the first quarter this year were $19 million below last year primarily due to lower average corn and soybean prices. Noting the less than perfect correlation between revenues and income in the grain business, the company indicated that grain sales margins and space income were both higher during the most recent quarter. The group also continued to benefit from its investment in Lansing Grain, a grain trading company. Gross margin improvement also boosted operating results for the group's plant nutrient business in the first three months of 2005 in spite of significantly higher fertilizer ingredient prices. During the quarter, the Agriculture Group continued to evaluate the possibility of investing in new ethanol production facilities in its eastern corn belt region.
The Rail Group's operating income of $3.6 million in the first quarter this year was $2.3 million above the $1.3 million it earned in the year-earlier three-month period. Revenues of $17.7 million for the quarter were almost 60 percent higher than the $11.1 generated in the comparable period of 2004. Car values and lease rates continued to be strong in this most recent quarter, and the utilization rate of the group's railcar fleet was again higher than year-earlier levels. Also contributing to the group's operating performance growth were the rail assets and attached leases acquired in a large acquisition that was completed midway through the first quarter of 2004. In early April, the group began operating a railcar repair business in Mississippi in addition to those it was already operating in Ohio and South Carolina.
The Processing Group's operating income of $1.1 million in the first three month period of 2005 was $2.1 million lower than a year ago. Revenues of $40.9 million for the quarter were $4.3 million below the $45.2 million it registered in the first quarter of last year. Turf-care product volumes were lower this year. Average margins were also down as a result of product cost increases that could not be fully recouped through higher prices.
The Retail Group reported revenues of $35.1 million for the first quarter of 2005, a 1.5 percent increase in same-store sales compared to the same three-month period in 2004. The average sale per transaction and average gross margin also improved somewhat. As a result, the group's operating loss of $2.1 million for the period was $0.2 million better than its 2004 performance.
"The first quarter is typically a loss period for our seasonal businesses, so earning net income of $1.0 million for the period this year shows that we're off to a good start," said President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson. "Agriculture and Rail both posted terrific results during the first three months of 2005. In total, the Company's earnings improved by seventeen cents a share, and total cash provided by our operating activities also continued to grow."
Anderson also stated "Looking forward, we're hoping for big corn and soybean crops again this year, and so far spring planting in much of our region is at, or ahead of, last year's pace. We still have a long way to go until the fall harvest, however, so prudence would suggest that we should reasonably expect our grain business to achieve full-year results more in line with the most recent three to five year averages rather than the exceptional results it achieved last year. All considered, I believe that our 2005 full-year EPS could be in the $2.20 to $2.50 range."
The company will host a webcast on Thursday, May 5, 2005 at 11:00 A.M. EDT, to discuss its first quarter performance and full-year outlook. This can be accessed under the heading "Financial Information" on its website at .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
MAUMEE, Ohio, July 5, 2005 / PRNewswire-FirstCall /  - The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE) today stated that damage to one of its two ship-loading grain elevators in Toledo will not prevent the company from meeting its customer service commitments. The elevator, which The Andersons leases from Cargill, Inc., was damaged by two explosions and a subsequent fire on Friday, July 1, the cause of which is still being investigated. The damaged elevator represents about seven percent of the company's total grain storage capacity.
"Although the damage will severely disrupt activities at this facility, our other Andersons' elevators in the Toledo area will help us fulfill our cash grain purchase and sale contracts as well as any delivery obligations to the Chicago Board of Trade," said Hal Reed, President of the Grain Division. "Thankfully, no one was injured in the incident which severely damaged portions of the facility. While the full extent of the damage has not yet been determined, we have already begun planning our strategy to work around the damaged facility and begin repairs," said Mr. Reed. "We're prepared to do whatever it takes to give our customers the service they deserve and have come to expect from us. Having four other elevators in the Toledo area will help mitigate the service disruption and logistics issues that we expect to encounter."
According to Gary Smith, Vice President Finance and Treasurer, "The financial impact of the damage cannot be precisely determined at this time. The company is adequately insured for property losses and/or business interruption, with a deductible amount of two hundred fifty thousand dollars. It's likely that the facility reconstruction and insurance claim process will extend into 2006, so we could experience a reduction in 2005 earnings with a commensurate increase next year once the insurance claim is resolved. Earnings for the two-year period should not be impacted materially."
The Andersons, Inc. is a diversified company with interests in the grain and plant nutrient sectors of U.S. agriculture, as well as in railcar marketing, industrial materials formulation, turf products production, and general merchandise retailing. Founded in Maumee, Ohio, in 1947, the company presently has operations in seven U.S. states plus rail equipment leasing interests in Canada and Mexico. Total revenues in 2004 were $1.3 billion.

Maumee, Ohio 43537
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE            AT THE COMPANY: Gary Smith (419) 891  6417 TUESDAY, AUGUST 2, 2005
, today announced second-quarter 2005 net income of $10.4 million, an improvement of $0.3 million from the second quarter of 2004 when the company earned $10.1 million. Earnings per diluted share for the period were $1.35, unchanged from 2004 results. Total revenues were $365 million for the second quarter this year compared to $375 million a year ago. The reduction in revenues was attributed to lower average grain prices. The company's second-quarter 2005 results included a favorable tax adjustment of $0.6 million attributed to Ohio tax reform legislation which was enacted on June 30. For the first half of 2005, the company's net income was $11.4 million, or $1.48 per diluted share, on revenues of $624 million. Last year, The Andersons earned $9.8 million, or $1.31 per diluted share, in the first half, on revenues of $649 million.
MAUMEE, OHIO, AUGUST 2, 2005The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
th
The Agriculture Group's second-quarter operating income of $8.9 million was $2.0 million below the $10.9 million it earned in the same period last year. Revenues of $253 million for the second quarter this year were $14 million below last year primarily due to lower average corn and soybean prices. Average grain margins were relatively unchanged during the quarter, but space income declined and some grain inventory shrink and quality adjustments were incurred. The group's plant nutrient business achieved operating income growth in the second quarter in spite of significantly higher commodity prices compared to 2004. Tonnage shipments were relatively unchanged, but operating income per ton was higher, and the group's farm centers also improved. Through the first six months of 2005, the Agriculture Group had operating income of $9.9 million on revenues of $418 million. In the first half of last year, the group had revenues of $450 million and operating income of $9.4 million. The group expects to begin construction of a 55 million gallon-per-year ethanol production facility adjacent to its Albion, Michigan grain facility soon. While preliminary site work has begun, completion of the project is contingent upon several final items, including state and local economic incentives. The company is also exploring the construction of a 110 million gallon ethanol plant adjacent to its Clymers, Indiana grain facility. No decision has yet been made about construction on this site. The Company anticipates some level of outside investment on each of these projects. In July, a grain elevator located in Toledo, Ohio, which The Andersons operates, was severely damaged by an explosion and fire. The company indicated that the necessary repairs will extend into next year. As a result, 2005 income will be reduced, but this will be mostly offset next year when the insurance claim process is completed. Total income for the two years should not be impacted materially by the accident.
The Rail Group's operating income of $3.8 million in the second quarter this year was $1.7 million above the $2.1 million it earned in the same three-month period a year ago. Revenues of $17.7 million for the quarter were $4.6 million higher than the $13.1 generated in the second quarter 2004. The rail leasing business continued to achieve excellent revenue and operating income growth during the most recent three-month period. Car values and lease rates continued to be strong, and the utilization rate of the group's railcar fleet was again higher than year-earlier levels. The group's railcar repair shops and its steel fabrication business also achieved revenue and operating income growth in the second quarter. For the first half of 2005, the Rail Group had operating income of $7.4 million on revenues of $35.4 million. Last year the group reported first-half revenues of $24.2 million and operating income of $3.3 million. During the second quarter, the group purchased 2,000 railcars, increasing its total fleet to approximately 18,000 railcars. In July, the company announced the purchase of two product lines of fluid filtration equipment that will be manufactured and marketed by the group's steel fabrication business.
The Processing Group's operating income of $0.4 million in the second quarter of 2005 was $0.6 million lower than a year ago. Revenues of $40.5 million for the quarter were $0.5 million higher than the $40.0 million it registered in the second quarter of last year. Turf-care product volumes were lower this year, primarily with industrial accounts, and expenses in the cob products business increased. Through six months this year, the Processing Group had $81.4 million of revenues and $1.5 million of operating income. In the first half of 2004, the group's revenues were $85.3 million and operating income was $4.2 million. While reaffirming its commitment to the professional sector of the lawn products industry, the group is reassessing its strategic position in that industry's consumer and industrial sectors.
The Retail Group reported revenues of $54.4 million for the second quarter of 2005, a 0.2 percent decrease in same-store sales compared to the same three-month period in 2004. The average sale per customer and average gross margin both improved somewhat, and the group's operating income of $3.8 million for the period was $0.1 million better than its 2004 performance. Sales of lawn and garden products were strong this spring, recovering from the rather poor spring season experienced last year. The group's June year-to-date revenues were $89.5 million this year, 0.4 percent higher than last year. First half operating income this year was $1.7 million, $0.3 million above the $1.4 million of operating income it generated in 2004.
"The second quarter is always a very strong period for several of our seasonal businesses, and this year was no exception. Our net income of $10.4 million for the three-month period was a record," said President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson. "Agriculture's plant nutrient business, Rail and Retail all achieved operating income growth during the second quarter of 2005, and these same businesses are also ahead of last year through six months. In total, the Company's earnings are seventeen cents a share ahead of last year, and the strong cash flow generated by our operating businesses continues to enable us to pursue promising new growth opportunities."
Anderson also stated "The corn and soybean crops in our region were definitely impacted by the hot and dry weather we experienced in June and early July. Recent rains have helped, but the proportion of Illinois crops rated "good" or "excellent" in weekly USDA surveys remains way below recent years' experience. Although we expect that our Agriculture Group's second half grain income will be closer to multi-year averages rather than last year's record performance, the strong results achieved by our plant nutrient, rail and retail businesses suggest that our previously-announced full-year earnings projection of $2.20 to 2.50 per share is still appropriate."
The company will host a webcast on Wednesday, August 3, 2005 at 11:00 A.M. EDT, to discuss its second quarter performance and full-year outlook. This can be accessed under the heading "Financial Information" on its website at .

MAUMEE, Ohio August 18, 2005 The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE) announced today the restructuring of its Processing Group. The Group's Lawn business unit will focus on the professional market and on areas where it can add value in the consumer and industrial markets. Mike Anderson, Chief Executive Officer, said, "We will serve all sectors of the industry; however, we will concentrate on customers and products where we can add value. The lawn/turf fertilizer business has become an increasingly high volume, commodity-oriented market. We will direct our energies in markets where our innovative and differentiated products can create market growth and margin opportunity for us and our customers. As in the past, we will continue to produce high-quality lawn fertilizers and other lawn care products under our own brand, Andersons Golf Products, and exclusive labels for certain retailers and third-party manufacturers. I feel good about the new direction of this business unit and I am committed to return this unit to profitability."
Gary Smith, Vice President Finance and Treasurer said, "In 2004, the Processing Group produced revenues of $126 million. As a result of the business restructuring, we expect to reduce working capital, labor and benefit costs because of the new product mix. We anticipate that the Processing Group will incur severance costs of approximately $1 million in 2005. It is not anticipated that this cost will have a significant impact on the current $2.20-$2.50 per share earnings guidance for 2005."
This change affects only the Processing Group. The Plant Nutrient Division, focused on plant nutrients for the agricultural markets, anti-icers, nitrogen reagents and other industrial products, is completely unaffected by this change.
Tom Waggoner, formerly Vice President of Sales and Marketing for the Group, will assume the President's role. Rick Anderson, President of the Processing Group, will leave the company to pursue other opportunities.
In addition, the Company announced a cash dividend of 8 1/2 cents per share, payable October 24, 2005, to shareholders of record on October 3, 2005. This is The Andersons' 36th consecutive quarterly cash dividend since its listing on Nasdaq on February 20, 1996. There are approximately 7.5 million common shares outstanding.

MAUMEE, Ohio September 14, 2005 The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE) announced today the September 15, 1:00pm, groundbreaking for a 55 million gallon ethanol plant to be built at the site of its grain terminal in Albion, Michigan. The ethanol plant will be owned and operated by The Andersons Albion Ethanol LLC. The Andersons, Inc. is manager, and together with 4 other investors, co-owner of The Andersons Albion Ethanol LLC.
th
The new facility is expected be completed by September, 2006, and will involve an aggregate investment of approximately $86.0 million. The designer and general contractor will be ICM, Inc. of Colwich, KS, and industry leader in ethanol technology and plant construction. Construction and term financing will be provided by CoBank, ACB, Omaha, NB; Farm Credit Services of America, Omaha, NB; Greenstone Farm Credit Services, East Lansing, MI; and Farm Credit of Texas, Austin, TX.
Ethanol is a gasoline additive derived from corn, which the company expects to market to gasoline blenders and refineries in the Great Lakes region. Other co-products of the plant include distillers dried grains, an animal feed ingredient, and carbon dioxide, which will be processed and packed by a third party processor.
"We expect the construction process to employ approximately 250 people, and the plant itself, once operational, to create approximately 33 full and part-time jobs. It will provide an additional market for area corn growers, and, as a renewable energy source, will help stretch the country's oil supply. We are excited to be in the ethanol business, which we think fits very well with our longstanding expertise in grain trading and storage, commodity risk management, materials handling and rail transportation," said Mike Anderson, President and CEO of The Andersons, Inc.
"We must also express our appreciation to the state, county and township governing bodies, and their economic development units, for their strong support of the project. It simply would not have gotten off the ground without their cooperation," said Mr. Anderson.
"Promoting the development and use of alternative energies is vital to the state's economic success in the 21 century," Governor Jennifer M. Granholm said. "This new plant will turn an important agricultural resource into fuel for Michigan's future, helping Michigan farmers while advancing the nation's goal to become less dependent on foreign oil."
st
"As an automotive industry leader, we must take the lead in developing alternative energy sources to fuel the state's economy into the 21 century," Michigan Economic Development Corporation President and CEO James Epolito said. "The Andersons' new ethanol plant in Albion will convert one of Michigan's most abundant resources into renewable energy, providing a new market for our farmers and creating new jobs in the region."

Maumee, Ohio 43537
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE            AT THE COMPANY: Gary Smith (419) 891  6417 WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 2005
, today announced a net loss of $0.6 million for the third quarter. In the same three-month period last year, the company reported a net income of $1.0 million. Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter this year were a loss of nine cents. In 2004, the company earned fourteen cents per diluted share during the third quarter. Total revenues were $289 million for the third quarter this year, 16 percent above its third-quarter 2004 total of $248 million. For the first nine months of 2005, the company's net income was $10.8 million, or $1.40 per diluted share, on revenues of $912 million. Last year, The Andersons earned $10.9 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, in the first nine months, on revenues of $897 million.
MAUMEE, OHIO, NOVEMBER 2, 2005The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Agriculture Group incurred an operating loss of $3.3 million in the third quarter. Last year it reported an operating income of $0.3 million for the period. Revenues of $206 million for the third quarter this year were $39 million above last year primarily due to increased grain sales volume. Average grain margins were lower during the quarter, and some grain inventory and quality adjustments were incurred. The group's plant nutrient business matched its 2004 results for the third quarter. Nutrient sales volume was down slightly, and commodity prices were significantly higher than they were in 2004, but margins remained strong, and application acreage growth improved service revenues. Through the first three quarters of 2005, the Agriculture Group had operating income of $6.6 million on revenues of $623 million. In the first nine months of last year, the group had revenues of $617 million and operating income of $9.7 million. The company is a 44 percent equity investor in The Andersons Albion Ethanol LLC which began construction of a 55 million gallon-per-year ethanol production facility during the third quarter. The new plant will be situated next to The Andersons' Albion, Michigan grain elevator. The company is also exploring the construction of a 110 million gallon ethanol plant adjacent to its Clymers, Indiana grain facility and anticipates some level of outside investment in this project as well. In July, a grain elevator located in Toledo, Ohio, which The Andersons operates, was severely damaged by an explosion and fire. Although negatively impacting its current year income, the company believes that the accident will not have a material impact on the two-year (2005-06) total once the insurance claim process is completed sometime next year.
The Rail Group's operating income of $5.8 million in the third quarter this year was $0.9 million above the $4.9 million it earned in the same three-month period a year ago. Revenues of $23.2 million for the quarter were $3.8 million higher than the $19.4 generated in the third quarter of 2004. The rail leasing business continued to achieve excellent revenue and operating income growth during the most recent three-month period. Car values and lease rates continued to be strong, and the utilization rate of the group's railcar fleet was again higher than year-earlier levels. The group's third quarter operating results included income from the sale of some railcars, although this was less than the income it realized on a larger sale of railcars during the third quarter of last year. The group's railcar repair shops' revenues and operating income for the period were down slightly from a year ago, but the steel fabrication business, including the fluid filtration product lines that the group acquired during the quarter, contributed to the overall revenue and income growth. Through nine months, the Rail Group had operating income of $13.3 million on revenues of $58.6 million and had added more than 3,000 railcars to its fleet, increasing its total to approximately 18,000 railcars. Last year the group reported September year-to-date revenues of $43.6 million and operating income of $8.2 million.
The Processing Group's $3.0 million operating loss in the third quarter was $1.1 million higher than the $1.9 million operating loss it incurred a year ago. Revenues of $19.2 million for the quarter were $1.6 million below the $20.8 million it registered in the third quarter of last year. Turf-care product volumes were lower this year, primarily with industrial accounts, and cob product gross margins declined due to increased raw material costs. Cob operating expenses were also higher in the third quarter this year. Through nine months, the Processing Group had $100.6 million of revenues and an operating loss of $1.6 million. In the first three quarters of 2004, the group reported revenues of $106.1 million and operating income of $2.4 million. Recently, the group announced a restructuring of its turf products business to focus on the professional market and certain areas of the consumer and industrial markets.
The Retail Group reported revenues of $40.5 million for the most recent quarter, a 1.4 percent decrease in same-store sales from the third quarter of 2004. The group's third-quarter operating loss was $0.8 million this year, $0.6 million wider than last year's result. While sales in food categories were higher than last year, and their margins remained strong, sales in other product categories were down. Operating expenses were somewhat higher during the quarter in part due to increased health-care and other employee benefit costs. The group's September year-to-date revenues were $130 million this year, just slightly lower than last year. Operating income for the first nine months of 2005 was $0.9 million, about $0.3 million below the $1.2 million it generated in the first three quarters of 2004.
"Our Rail Group and Agriculture's plant nutrient business are achieving excellent income growth this year," said President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson. "In spite of the impact of insurance deductibles and business interruptions in our grain and cob operations this quarter, and severance costs we incurred in the restructuring of our lawn business, our overall performance in the third quarter leaves us right on track toward achieving the $2.20 to $2.50 earnings per share for the year that we've been projecting throughout the year. More importantly, we're encouraged by our ability to continue to grow our very profitable Rail business and to expand into the promising ethanol industry."
The company will host a webcast on Thursday, November 3, 2005 at 11:00 A.M. EST, to discuss its third quarter performance and full-year outlook. This can be accessed under the heading "Financial Information" on its website at .

Item 4.02 Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
On November 16, 2005, management of The Andersons, Inc. (the "Company") concluded, with the approval of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, that the Companys previously issued financial statements for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2005, which are included in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, should not be relied upon because of an error in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. All other components of the condensed consolidated financial statements are correct with no impact to the condensed consolidated balance sheets, statements of earnings or shareholders equity. The error relates to the impact on the cash flow statement of a single class of debt financing transactions. The condensed consolidated cash flow statement should have indicated a gain of $2.1 million on sales of railcars and related leases for the nine month period ended September 30, 2005, instead of the $4.9 million reported. The statement should also have indicated proceeds from th e sale or financing of railcars and related leases of $49.3 million rather than the $52.1 million reported for the same period. The related subtotals for cash flow from operations and net cash used in investing activities also require adjustment. However, the net change in cash and cash equivalents for the period was accurately stated due to the offsetting nature of the error. The Company, with the approval of its Audit Committee, concluded that it was necessary to restate the affected financial statement. The restatement will not change the Companys previously reported condensed consolidated balance sheet, condensed consolidated statements of earnings or condensed consolidated statements of shareholders equity, including total assets, revenue, net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share. In addition to the financial statement impacts of this restatement, management acknowledges the implications of these errors on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control ov er financial reporting as of September 30, 2005. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. As of the quarterly reporting period ended September 30, 2005, the Company did not maintain effective controls over the preparation, review, presentation, and disclosure of the Companys condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. Specifically, the Company did not adequately review the classification of proceeds from long-term debt financing and the related impact on net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in investing activities. This control deficiency resulted in the restatement of the Companys previously issued financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2005, which are included in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, this control deficiency could result in a misstatement of cash flows that would result in a material misstatement to annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness. Subsequent to the discovery of this error and control deficiency, the Company has implemented enhanced procedures to properly prepare its financial statements, specifically the condensed consolidated statement of cash flow. These procedures include additional reviews of data provided by decentralized accounting personnel and more formal quarterly reporting packages. Management believes that, after giving effect to these additional controls, the Companys internal control environment will be effective, however, not all of the newly designed controls have operated for a sufficient period of time to demonstrate operating effectiveness. Therefore, management will continue to monitor and assess its remediation activities to ensure that the material weakness discussed above will be remediated. Management and the Audit Committee have discussed the conclusions disclosed in this Form 8-K with its independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.

(f) In performing its obligations hereunder, the Servicer may, acting in the name of the Company and without the necessity of obtaining the prior consent of the Company or the Agent, enter into and grant modifications, waivers and amendments to the terms of any Lease as it may deem reasonably necessary or advisable to maximize Equipment Lease Proceeds, except for modifications, waivers or amendments that (i) are inconsistent with the Servicing Standard, (ii) after giving effect thereto, would cause such Lease to cease to comply with any of the representations and warranties of the Seller in Section of the Sale Agreement or any of the representations and warranties of the Manager in Section 4.03 of the Management Agreement, as applicable (iii) after giving effect thereto, would permit the Equipment Lessee thereunder to take action with respect to the Railcars which are subject to such Lease which would cause the Company to be in default of its obligations under any of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, or (iv) otherwise could reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect, individually or in the aggregate, the interests of the Company, the Agent or the Lenders or would otherwise conflict with Section 2.01(l).
     
(g) Unless otherwise directed by the Company, the Servicer shall not be required on the Company's behalf to threaten or commence any legal or other proceedings before any court or Governmental Authority or nongovernmental organization in connection with its performance or actions hereunder if, in the Servicer's reasonable judgment consistent with the Servicing Standard, the potential expense or risk associated with such exercise or action is such that the Servicer would not undertake such exercise or action with respect to other railcars owned, managed or serviced by the Servicer. If the Servicer, in accordance with this Agreement, commences a legal proceeding to enforce a Defaulted Lease or commences or participates in a legal proceeding relating to or involving a Lease, the Company will be deemed to have automatically assigned such Lease to the Servicer solely for purposes of commencing or participating in any such proceeding as a party or claimant, and the Servicer is authorized and empowered by the Company, pursuant to this Section 2.01, to execute and deliver, on behalf of itself and the Company, any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or partial or full release or discharge, and all other notices, demands, claims, complaints, responses, affidavits or other documents or instruments, without recourse to the Company, in connection with any such proceedings. If in any enforcement suit or legal proceeding it is held that the Servicer may not enforce a Lease on the ground that is not a real party in interest or a holder entitled to enforce the Lease, then the Company will, at the Servicer's expense and direction, take steps to enforce the Lease, including bringing suit in the Company's name.
(h) In the event of any modification, waiver or amendment of any Lease in accordance with this Section 2.01 or any assignment of any Lease or sublease of any Railcars, the Servicer will (i) duly note such modification, waiver, amendment, assignment or sublease in the next succeeding Quarterly Servicer Report (and certify therein that such modification, waiver or amendment is not prohibited by the provisions of this Section 2.01), (ii) promptly furnish the Agent with a copy of such modification, waiver, amendment, assignment or sublease (except the Servicer shall promptly deliver to the Agent original copies of any sublease as provided in Section 2.01(j)), and (iii) shall take such other action, if any, as is necessary to preserve and maintain the perfection and priority of the Lien of the Security Agreement with respect to such Lease as so modified or amended (including, if necessary, promptly delivering all originals thereof not in the possession of the Equipment Lessee under the related Lease to the Agent).
(i) At the request of a Equipment Lessee, the Servicer may, in its sole discretion, consent to the assignment of any Lease (or Equipment Lessee's leasehold interest in Railcars leased thereunder); that (i) such Equipment Lessee will remain liable for all of its obligations under such Lease prior to such assignment, (ii) such assignee satisfies the credit criteria set forth in the Servicer's credit policies and procedures, (iii) after giving effect thereto, the Company will be in compliance with the Concentration Limits, and (iv) such assignment will not cause the relevant Leases or Railcars to cease to comply with any of the representations and warranties of the Manager contained in Section 4.03 of the Management Agreement.
provided, however,
(j) At the request of a Equipment Lessee, the Servicer may, in its sole discretion, consent to the sublease of any Railcars under a Lease; that unless each Equipment Lessee will remain liable for all of its obligations under such Lease (including with respect to the related Railcars) and such sublease shall be subject and subordinate to the Equipment Lessee's obligations under such Lease, then (i) such sublessee satisfies the credit criteria set forth in the Servicer's credit policies and procedures and (ii) the original copies of such sublease which constitute chattel paper are delivered to the Agent, and the Servicer instructs that all payments thereunder are to be sent directly to the Lockbox Bank for deposit into the Lockbox Account.
provided, however,
(k) The Servicer may enter into servicing agreements with one or more subservicers, with prior written notice to the Company and the Agent, to perform all or a portion of the servicing functions on behalf of the Servicer; that the Servicer will remain obligated and be liable to the Agent, and the Company for servicing and administering the Leases in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, without diminution of such obligation and liability by virtue of the appointment of such subservicer, to the same extent and under the same terms and conditions as if the Servicer alone were servicing and administering the Leases. The fees and expenses of the subservicer (if any) will be as agreed between the Servicer and its subservicer and shall be the liability of the Servicer exclusively, and neither the Agent, the Lenders nor the Company will have any responsibility therefor; to the extent agreed to between the Servicer and subservicer, expenses of the subservicer may be reimbursed by the Servicer and treated for all purposes hereof as expenses incurred by the Servicer (which shall be reimbursable by the Company if and to the extent provided herein and subject to the availability of funds therefor under the Loan Agreement). All actions of a subservicer taken pursuant to such a subservicer agreement will be taken as an agent of the Servicer with the same force and effect as though performed by the Servicer. The Successor Servicer may in the course of performing its duties hereunder employ agents or attorneys, and the Successor Servicer shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of, or for the supervision of, any such agent or attorney appointed by it with due care hereunder.
provided, however,
provided, however,
(l) The Servicer shall not take any action, without the consent of the Company and the Required Lenders which would release any Person from any of its covenants or obligations under any of the Leases or under any other instrument included in the Collateral, which action or release would materially and adversely affect the interests of the Agent and the Lenders in any such Lease or which would result in the amendment, hypothecation, subordination, termination, set off or discharge of, or impair the validity or effectiveness of, any of the Leases or any such instrument, except as expressly provided herein and therein.
. (a) The Servicer shall monitor the creditworthiness and performance of the Equipment Lessees and use its best efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to collect all payments of Rents and all other amounts required under the terms and provisions of the Leases to be paid as and when the same shall become due, and shall use collection procedures consistent with the Servicing Standard.
Section 2.02. Credit Monitoring; Collection of Lease Receivables and Remittances; the Lockbox Account
(b) In addition, the Servicer shall use its best efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to collect all amounts due and owing, and to enforce all of the Company's rights to collect such amounts, from any and all other Persons and sources (other than Equipment Lessees to the extent provided elsewhere in this Section 2.02) with respect to the Leases or the Railcars, including any insurance proceeds, warranty payments, and overpayments and refunds with respect to taxes, maintenance or other services provided to or for the benefit of the Company or the Leases or the Railcars and hourly fees and railroad mileage credits.
(c) The Company will establish the Lockbox Account. The Servicer shall not create or permit to exist any Lien, charge or encumbrance on the Lockbox Account.
(d) The Servicer will bill each Equipment Lessee (at least monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually, as applicable for Rent payable under such Lease) as agent for the Company, in invoices, separate from invoices for any leases or railcars not owned by the Company, for the amount of rent or other amounts (including the Rent) owed with respect to the Railcars by the Equipment Lessee. Each invoice will provide a detailed listing of such Railcars, and the applicable amounts due and owing (including the Rent) with respect to each such Railcar, to which the invoice relates. For certain Equipment Lessees, invoices may be sent electronically. The Railcars will be sufficiently identified in the detail of the invoice, by serial or other identification number, to allow the parties to specifically identify the amounts which are due to the Company. All invoices will instruct the obligor thereunder to make payment of such invoice directly to the Lockbox Bank for deposit into the Lockbox Account.
(e) The Servicer shall arrange with the Lockbox Bank that by 1:00 p.m. on each Business Day (or as soon thereafter as practicable), the Lockbox Bank will make available to the Servicer a computer file of customer checks and related documentation containing information with respect to all payments received in such Lockbox Account from 12:00 noon of the previous Business Day through 12:00 noon of such Business Day.
(f) If the payment information made available by Lockbox Bank to the Servicer under Section 2.01(e) is insufficient to determine the proper allocation of a payment (or any portion thereof) between The Andersons and the Company, the Servicer will use such other information as is available and conduct such procedures as are appropriate to determine the proper allocation of such payment, including a review of original Lease and invoice information and contacting Equipment Lessees, to the extent necessary.
(g) By the close of business on each Business Day, the Servicer will cause all funds held in the Lockbox Account to be transferred to the Collection Account.
(h) If, notwithstanding the payment instructions given by the Servicer in its invoices under Section 2.01(d), Lease payments or other amounts in respect of the Railcars are received directly by the Servicer, the Servicer agrees to hold any such Lease payments or other amounts in trust for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders and forthwith, promptly and in any event with the time set forth in Section 2.01(g), to transmit and deliver to the Lockbox Bank (for transfer pursuant to Section 2.01(g) to the Collection Account), in the form received, all cash, checks and other instruments or writings for the payment of money so received by the Servicer.
(i) The Lockbox Account will be titled in the name of the Company for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders. As to the Company's billings following the appointment of a Successor Servicer, the Successor Servicer shall re-caption the invoices to refer to the Successor Servicer, as agent for the Company. In instances where a customer of both The Andersons and the Company pays with a single check that is not in the full amount owed to all such parties, unless it is manifestly clear that the deduction is allocable to the Company, the Successor Servicer will be instructed to assume that the deduction is allocable to The Andersons and to the extent that such deduction exceeds the amount due to The Andersons, any such excess shall be allocated pro-rata (based upon reported billings) to the Company and Andersons.
(j) The Servicer may not allow an offset of the amount of any security deposit against any payment under any Lease.
. With respect to Leases serviced by the Servicer, the Servicer shall retain all data and records relating directly to, or maintained in connection with, the servicing of such Leases at the offices of the Servicer, and shall give the Company and the Agent, or such other Person as the Agent shall direct, access to all such data and records at all reasonable times, and, while a Servicer Event of Termination shall be continuing, the Servicer shall, on demand of the Agent, deliver to or at the direction of the Agent all data and records necessary for the servicing of the Equipment Leases. If the rights of the Servicer shall have been terminated pursuant to Section 6.01, the Servicer shall, in accordance with Section 6.01(e), deliver to the Agent or the Successor Servicer all data and records necessary for the servicing of such Leases and shall otherwise cooperate with the Agent and the Successor Servicer as set forth in Section 6.01(e).

(ii) all amounts received in respect of Leases and Railcars that relate to the period prior to the Closing Date; and
(iii) all amounts received in respect of Leases following the Purchase thereof by the Manager or the Servicer;

provided, however,
. The obligations of the Servicer under this Agreement shall not be subject to any defense, counterclaim or right of offset which the Servicer has or may have against the Company or the Agent whether in respect of this Agreement, any Lease or Railcar or otherwise.
Section 2.05. No Offset
(a) Pursuant to the Security Agreement, the Company has pledged the Collateral to the Agent and the Lenders and the Agent will hold such Collateral, including, without limitation, the Lease Files, for the benefit of Agent and the Lenders subject to the terms and provisions thereof.
Section 2.06. Custody of Lease Files.
(b) The Servicer, as agent of the Agent and the Company, shall hold and hereby acknowledges that it shall hold the Lease Files (exclusive of any original counterpart of any Lease constituting chattel paper held by the Agent or in the possession of the Equipment Lessee under such Lease) and any other Collateral that it may from time to time receive hereunder as custodian for the Agent, in accordance with the Servicing Standard as such Servicing Standard applies to servicers acting as custodial agents. As custodian, the Servicer shall have and perform the following powers and duties:

provided
however
(e) If, in order to conduct collection and other servicing activities in accordance with the Servicing Standard, it is necessary for the Servicer to possess the original counterpart of any Lease which is held by the Agent, the Servicer will submit a request for release to the Agent substantially in the form attached as Exhibit B. Upon receipt of such request for release, the Agent shall release to the Servicer the original counterpart of such Lease within 7 days; , that without the written consent of the Agent shall not have released more than 10 Lease Files to the Servicer that have not been returned.

The Servicer shall follow such practices and procedures as are consistent with the Servicing Standard and otherwise as it shall deem necessary or advisable and as shall be customary and usual in its servicing of railcar leases and other actions by the Servicer in order to realize upon such a Lease, which may include its best efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to enforce any recourse obligations of Equipment Lessees.

Any such insurance policy shall protect and insure the Servicer against losses, including forgery, theft, embezzlement, and fraudulent acts of such persons and shall be maintained in a form and amount that would meet the requirements of a prudent institutional servicer. No provision of this Section 2.08 requiring such insurance policy shall diminish or relieve the Servicer from its duties and obligations as set forth in this Agreement. Any such insurance policy shall not be cancelled or modified without ten days' prior written notice to the Agent.

The Lenders hereby acknowledge that the Agent shall be, from time to time, required or requested to take discretionary action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other Transaction Document. In taking such action, the Agent shall not have any liability therefor, other than for the Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action hereunder and under any other Loan Document at the request of the Required Lenders unless it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and all liability, cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.
Action on Instructions of Lenders
SECTION 7.7. . The Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower.

If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above provided that if the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder, under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Agent is appointed) and under the other Transaction Documents and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Agent shall instead be made by or to the Lenders directly, until such time as the Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above in this paragraph. Upon the acceptance of a successor's appointment as Agent hereunder or under the Security Agreement and the Pledge Agreement, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Agent and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder, under the other Loan Documents and the other Transaction Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Agent's resignation hereunder, under the other Loan Documents and the other Transaction Documents, the provisions of this Article shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective related parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Agent was acting as Agent.

The Borrower agrees that if amounts outstanding under this Agreement and the Loans are due or unpaid, or shall have been declared or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Participant shall, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, be deemed to have the right of setoff in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement, provided that, in purchasing such participating interest, such Participant shall be deemed to have agreed to share with the Lenders the proceeds thereof as provided in Section 8.13 as fully as if such Participant were a Lender hereunder. The Borrower also agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.20 with respect to its participation in the Loans outstanding from time to time as if such Participant were a Lender; provided that, in the case of Section 9.20, such Participant shall have complied with the requirements of said Section, and provided, further, that no Participant shall be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to such Section than the transferor Lender would have been entitled to receive in respect of the amount of the participation transferred by such transferor Lender to such Participant had no such transfer occurred.

Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date determined pursuant to such Transfer Agreement, (x) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such Transfer Agreement, have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder with Loans as set forth therein, and (y) the Assignor thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such Transfer Agreement, be released from its obligations under this Agreement.

The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the Loans and any Notes evidencing such Loans recorded therein for all purposes of this Agreement. Any assignment of any Loan shall be effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto being made in the Register (and each Note shall expressly so provide). Any assignment or transfer of all or part of a Loan shall be registered on the Register only upon surrender for registration of assignment or transfer of the Note evidencing such Loan, accompanied by a duly executed Transfer Agreement; thereupon one or more new Notes in the same aggregate principal amount shall be issued to the designated Assignee, and the old Notes shall be returned by the Agent to the Borrower marked "canceled".
Register
(e) Upon its receipt of a Transfer Agreement executed by an Assignor and an Assignee (and, in any case where the consent of any other Person is required, by each such other Person) together with payment to the Agent of a registration and processing fee of $3,500, the Agent shall (i) promptly accept such Transfer Agreement and (ii) on the effective date determined pursuant thereto record the information contained therein in the Register and give notice of such acceptance and recordation to the Borrower. On or prior to such effective date, the Borrower, at its own expense, upon request, shall execute and deliver to the Agent (in exchange for the Note of the assigning Lender) a new Note to the order of such Assignee in an amount equal to the Loans assumed or acquired by it pursuant to such Transfer Agreement and, if the Assignor has retained a Loan, upon request, a new Note to the order of the Assignor in an amount equal to the Loans retained by it hereunder. Such new Note or Notes shall be dated the Closing Date and shall otherwise be in the form of the Note or Notes replaced thereby.
(f) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender to a Federal Reserve Bank; , that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

SECTION 8.21. . (a) All payments made by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority, excluding net income taxes and franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on the Agent or any Lender as a result of a present or former connection between the Agent or such Lender and the jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority imposing such tax or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any such connection arising solely from the Agent's or such Lender's having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or any other Loan Document). If any such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings ("Non-Excluded Taxes") or any Other Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to any Agent or any Lender hereunder, the amounts so payable to the Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to such Agent or such Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes and Other Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to any Lender with respect to any Non-Excluded Taxes (i) that are attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this Section or (ii) that are United States withholding taxes imposed on amounts payable to such Lender at the time such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, except to the extent that such Lender's assignor (if any) was entitled, at the time of assignment, to receive additional amounts from the Borrower with respect to such Non-Excluded Taxes pursuant to this paragraph (a). In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

(b) Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes are payable by the Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter the Borrower shall send to the Agent for the account of the Agent or Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt received by the Borrower showing payment thereof. If the Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Agent and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure. The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.
(c) Each Lender (or Transferee) that is not a "U.S. Person" as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "Non-U.S. Lender") shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased) two copies of either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender claiming complete exemption from, or a reduced rate of, U.S. federal withholding tax on all payments by the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of any Participant, on or before the date such Participant purchases the related participation). In addition, each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Non-U.S. Lender. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to the Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this paragraph that such Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver.
(d) A Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of non-U.S. withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate, provided that such Lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver such documentation and in such Lender's reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would not materially prejudice the legal position of such Lender.
SECTION 8.22. . The Borrower hereby waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages.

The Andersons, Inc. 480 W. Dussel Drive Maumee, Ohio 43537
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 2006 AT THE COMPANY: Gary Smith (419) 891-6418
, today announced fourth-quarter net income of $15.3 million, or $1.98 per diluted share and total revenues of $384 million. In the same three-month period of 2004, the company reported net income of $8.3 million, or $1.09 per diluted share, on $370 million of revenues. Full-year net income in 2005 was $26.1 million, or $3.39 per diluted share on $1.30 billion of revenues. In 2004, the company's net income was $19.1 million, or $2.55 per diluted share, and total revenues were $1.27 billion.
MAUMEE, OHIO, FEBRUARY 8, 2006The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Agriculture Group's fourth-quarter and full-year income both set new records. Operating income of $16.4 million for the quarter was $4.8 million higher than the $11.6 million the group generated a year earlier. Full-year operating income in 2005 was $23.0 million. This was $1.7 million above the $21.3 million achieved in 2004, the group's previous best performance. The Grain Division's total operating income in the fourth quarter was significantly higher than its 2004 result. For the full year, its operating income was down. In the fourth quarter, the group's Plant Nutrient Division exceeded its 2004 results and, in so doing, set a new income record for the full year.
The Rail Group's operating income of $9.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 more than tripled the $2.8 million it earned in the same three-month period a year ago. Revenues of $33.5 million for the quarter were $17.8 million higher than the $15.7 generated in the fourth quarter of 2004. Full-year income of $22.8 million and revenues of $92.0 million also exceeded 2004 results by a wide margin. In 2004, the group had earned $11.0 million on revenues of $59.3 million. The rail leasing business continued to achieve operating income growth during the most recent three-month period and the full year. The size of the group's fleet also continued to grow in 2005. From about 14,600 cars controlled by the group in December of 2004, the fleet was increased to more than 19,000 railcars by the end of 2005. The Rail Group's 2005 operating results also included gains on the sale of certain railcars. Income from the group's fabrication and railcar repair shops was higher in 2005 as a result of the fluid filtration product lines acquired earlier in the year which were immediately accretive.
The Turf and Specialty Group typically incurs a loss in the fourth quarter due to the seasonal nature of its business. This year the operating loss amounted to $1.5 million, on revenues of $22.0 million. During the same three-month period in 2004, the group's operating loss was $2.5 million, with revenues of $21.7 million. The $1.0 million improvement in the fourth-quarter operating loss was due to a change in the group's business model earlier this year which realigned staffing and assets in the turf and cob products businesses. For the full year, the group incurred an operating loss of $3.0 million. This was $2.9 million higher than its 2004 operating loss, and included $1.8 million of severance and other restructuring costs associated with the realignment and some property losses.
The Retail Group reported revenues of $52.8 million for the most recent quarter and $182.8 million for the full year. The group's fourth-quarter operating income of $2.0 million doubled its previous-year performance. In addition to continued favorable sales trends in food categories during the quarter, the group capitalized on high energy costs and frigid weather in December with strong sales of home insulation materials and outdoor workwear. Total customer counts and average gross margins were slightly lower in the fourth quarter this year, but the average amount each customer purchased increased. The group's operating income for the full year was $2.9 million, an increase of $0.8 million from 2004.
"The operating results our company achieved in the fourth quarter and full calendar year were impressive," said President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson. "We've also set the stage for continued income growth. At the present time, construction is underway on an ethanol production facility in Michigan, in which we will be the largest equity investor and manager. We've recently announced plans for a plant in Indiana, in which The Andersons will also be the lead equity investor. These two plants will collectively have a planned production capacity of 165 million gallons of ethanol per year. In addition to managing these facilities, we will provide grain origination, ethanol marketing, risk management and other services. The company is also a minority investor in a third ethanol plant, currently under construction in Indiana, for which we will provide grain origination services. With our entry into ethanol, continued growth in rail, and the improvement we demonstrated in all of our other businesses during the most recent quarter, I believe that our company's future looks pretty bright."
The company will host a webcast on Thursday, February 9, 2006 at 11:00 A.M. EST, to discuss its fourth quarter and full-year performance. This can be accessed under the heading "Financial Information" on its website at .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE            AT THE COMPANY: Gary Smith (419) 891  6417 WEDNESDAY, MAY 3, 2006
, today announced first-quarter net income of $3.8 million, or $0.49 per diluted share and total revenues of $281 million. In the same three-month period of 2005, the company reported net income of $1.0 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, on $259 million of revenues. The company now reports the performance of five operating groups in its segment data. Previously it had reported four operating units, one of which was the Agriculture Group. This group included the company's grain and emerging ethanol business as well as its plant nutrient business. The company indicated the change is intended to provide greater focus on the needs of these businesses as they grow and will also provide its investors greater transparency into the progress in achieving its goals.
MAUMEE, MAUMEE, OHIO, MAY 3, 2006The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Grain & Ethanol Group achieved operating income of $1.8 million in the most recent quarter, slightly higher than its year-earlier result. Total revenues of $128.6 million for the period were $7.7 million higher than the first quarter of 2005. The number of bushels handled by the group's elevators was higher than a year ago, but total gross profit dropped significantly due to weak domestic demand for soft red wheat. This decline and increases in labor costs were offset by strong earnings from Lansing Trade Group, LLC, the group's commodity trading affiliate, and receipt of a development fee earned in connection with the creation of a new limited liability company which broke ground last week to start construction of an ethanol production plant in Clymers, Indiana. Construction of another ethanol plant, located in Albion, Michigan, is progressing on schedule and expected to begin producing ethanol in the third quarter of this year. The Andersons is a significant investor in both of these projects and will provide general management, marketing, and risk management services to them and to other ethanol producers as well.
The Plant Nutrient Group incurred an operating loss of $1.2 million on $46.0 million of revenues in the first quarter of 2006. In this highly seasonal industry, the first quarter is typically a loss period. Last year the group incurred an operating loss of $0.8 million during the quarter with revenues of $44.1 million. The revenue increase was primarily due to higher prices for its products, most of which were well above first quarter 2005 levels. Recently, prices for some basic material product lines, particularly nitrogen, have begun to decline, causing customers to defer purchases until the second quarter, the primary planting season. As a result, tonnage volume declined, contributing to a drop in the group's gross profit as compared to the first quarter of 2005. In most of the core markets served by the group, the second quarter is a primary consumption period, and at this time, nutrient application and planting is well underway.
The Rail Group's operating income of
$6.2
million in the f
irst
quarter of 200
6 was $2.6 million higher than i
t earned in the same three-month period a year ago. Revenues of $3
4.4
million for the quarter were
up
$1
6.7
million
. Although the group sold some railcars during the quarter, its total fleet at the end of March totaled about 3,100 more railcars than a year ago, and the utilization rate (the percentage of the fleet in service at the end of the period) had also increased. Operating i
ncome from the group's railcar repair
and manufacturing businesses
w
as
also
higher in
the first quarter than the comparable three months last year. The group's operation in Mississippi was kept very busy repairing railcars damaged by last summer's hurricanes, and the
fluid filtration product lines acquired
during 2005 continued to be additive to the Rail Group's overall performance.
The first three months of the year are a key selling period for the Turf and Specialty Group's lawn products business. This year the group achieved operating income of $2.1 million on $39.5 million of revenues in the first quarter. Last year, it reported $1.1 million of income and $40.9 million of revenues for the period. Total lawn products tons sold were lower in the first quarter this year, in part due to some restructuring actions undertaken last year which also lowered working capital requirements and reduced expenses. Tons sold to accounts in the group's professional sector during the first three months of 2006 were higher than last year.
The Retail Group reported revenues of $32.1 million for the first quarter of 2006, a decrease of 8.4 percent in same-store sales from the same period in 2005, in part due to a mild winter and the timing of Easter this year. Some food product categories achieved growth during the quarter as did the addition of coffee bars at two of the group's Toledo area stores. For the three month period, the Retail Group incurred an operating loss of $2.4 million this year, slightly more than the $2.1 million it lost in the first quarter of 2005.
"Historically the first quarter has been a loss period for our company. Last year we broke out of that pattern and reported net income of $1 million for the quarter. This year we improved further, achieving net income of $3.8 million, or 49 cents per diluted share," said President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson. "Our rail and turf businesses both achieved higher income in the first quarter this year, as did Lansing Trade Group, our commodity trading affiliate. Construction on two new ethanol plants in Michigan and Indiana is underway. We're actively pursuing growth on several fronts: our much noted entry into the ethanol industry, continued growth in rail and commodity trading, development of new products, and process improvement initiatives in numerous areas of the company. All considered, I'm optimistic about our company's future."
Mr. Anderson also stated "Looking specifically at our earnings prospects for the full year, numerous factors will have a bearing on the outcome: weather patterns during the important agricultural planting and growing season within our region, nutrient and energy commodity prices, continued favorable railcar values and lease rates, retail and professional demand for lawn and garden products, and a successful launch of the new ethanol plant in Albion, Michigan. In light of these variables, there is a fairly wide range in our full-year earnings projections. At this time, we anticipate 2006 earnings per diluted share in a range from $3.40 to $3.80 per diluted share. As we move through the year, we should be able to narrow this spread."
The company will host a webcast on Thursday, May 4, 2006 at 11:00 A.M. ET, to discuss its performance. This can be accessed under the heading "Financial Information" on its website at .

The Lots shall be subject to the following restrictions:
Section 2. Restrictions.
(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Declaration, including, without limitation, the commercial use of the Activities Building described in Article IX, no Lot shall be used for any purpose other than that of single family residential dwelling with attached garage, one outbuilding and for purposes customarily incidental thereto. Single family residential structures must equal or exceed 3,500 square feet of living space and include an attached garage to accommodate at least two automobiles. Living space, for purposes of this Declaration, is enclosed space within a residential dwelling, finished, heated, and habitable. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) a Lot Owner may use a portion of a dwelling for his or her office or studio so long as those activities do not interfere with the quiet enjoyment or comfort of any other Lot Owner or Occupant, and so long as those activities do not increase the normal flow of traffic or number of individuals in and out of the property or in and out of that dwelling; and (ii) a Lot Owner or Occupant maintaining a personal or professional library, keeping personal business or professional records or accounts, or conducting personal business or professional telephone calls or correspondence, in or from a dwelling constructed on a Lot is engaging in a use expressly declared customarily incidental to principal residential use and is not in violation of these restrictions.
Lot Uses.
No portion of any Lot shall be used for any purpose other than that of a single family dwelling or a lawn, except for the commercial use of the Activities Building, except nothing herein contained, however, shall be construed to prevent the use of a portion of a Lot for any approved sidewalk, driveway, walkway, the planting of trees and shrubbery, landscaping or for the purpose of beautifying the Lot. No weeds, underbrush or other unsightly growth shall be permitted to grow or remain anywhere within the Subdivision and no unsightly objects shall be allowed to be placed or suffered to remain anywhere thereon. No fence, hedge, wall or enclosure of any kind, for any purposes shall be erected, placed or suffered to remain upon any Lot without the advance written consent of the Developer or the Association, except for any fence, hedge, wall or enclosure of any kind located on a Lot as of the date of this Declaration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, that portion of each Lot not containing a dwelling or structure, shall be landscaped in accordance with a landscape plan submitted to and approved by the Developer or the Association, and each such landscaped area shall thereafter be maintained in accordance with such plan. Any landscaping on any Lot existing as of the date of this Declaration is approved.
No basketball backboards shall be attached to any dwelling in the Subdivision. A basketball pole backboard shall be permitted in the rear yard of a Lot, subject to rules and regulations adopted by the Developer or the Association.

(b) Upon conveyance of easement rights in the Common Areas to the Association, the Common Areas shall be operated by the Association for the benefit of the Developer, Lot Owners, Occupants and their agents, servants, customers, invitees and licensees, subject to such rules and regulations as the Association may adopt from time to time.

(d) No noxious or offensive activity shall be permitted on any Lot, or upon the Common Areas, nor shall either be used in any way or for any purpose, which might endanger the health of, or unreasonably disturb, any other Lot Owner or Occupant. The prior customary use of the Activities Building shall be deemed not to constitute a nuisance for purposes hereof.
Nuisances.
(e) The Association may promulgate regulations restricting the parking of automobiles, inoperable vehicles, trucks, boats and recreational vehicles on the Lots and Common Areas, and may enforce such regulations or restrictions by levying fines or enforcement charges, having such vehicles towed away, or taking such other actions as it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate. The current parking use associated with the Activities Building is permitted.
Vehicles.
(f) No sign of any kind, including, but not limited to, signs affixed in anyway to vehicles, shall be displayed to the public view on the Lots, except: (a) on the Lots, one professionally prepared sign advertising the Lot for sale; and (b) on the Common Areas and Lots, signs advertising the sale of Lots by the Developer during the initial sales period, which shall continue until all Lots have been sold to parties unrelated to the Developer. No sign of any kind shall be displayed to the public view on or within the Unit unless approved by the Developer or Association. All existing signage, and replacements thereof that are no more extensive, indicating directions to the Activities Building are permitted.
Signs.

Animals.
(h) Each Lot shall be conveyed subject to the terms, conditions and provisions of this Declaration. To enable the Association to maintain accurate records of the names and addresses of Lot Owners, each Lot Owner agrees to notify the Association, in writing, within five (5) days after an interest in that Lot Owner's Lot has been transferred to another person. In addition, each Lot Owner agrees to provide to a purchaser of that owner's Lot a copy of the Association Organizational Documents and all effective rules and regulations. No Lot may be subdivided without the prior written consent of the Developer or the Association.
Conveyances.
(i) No action shall at any time be taken by the Association which in any manner would illegally discriminate against any Lot Owner in favor of another. The current uses of, and structures and improvements on, the Lots, including the Activities Building, which may conflict with, or may not be approved in accordance with, the terms of this Declaration, shall not be deemed a basis for discrimination with regard to any future use or development of a Lot.
Discrimination.
(j) The interpretation of the Developer as to the application of or any rule or regulation adopted by the Association, shall be binding upon all Lot Owners and Occupants until the Developer has sold and conveyed all Lots. Thereafter, in the event of any dispute between Lot Owners as to the application of these restrictions or any rule or regulation adopted by the Association, the party aggrieved shall submit a complaint in writing to the Association specifying the dispute. The Association shall set a time, date and place for a hearing within sixty (60) days thereafter, and give written notice to each party no less than three (3) days in advance of the hearing. The Association shall hear such evidence on the dispute as the Association deems proper and render a written decision on the matter within thirty (30) days of the hearing.

Location of Structures
(a) . In requiring the submission of detailed plans and specifications as herein set forth, the Developer intends to assure the development of the Subdivision as an architecturally harmonious, artistically desirable residential subdivision following a common landscape theme, with individual residences to be constructed in such architectural styles, with uniform building heights, roof lines, of such materials, and such colors, and located in such manner as to, in the judgment of the Architectural Control Committee, complement one another and promote the harmony and desirability of the Subdivision as a whole. In approving or withholding its approval of any plans and specifications, the Architectural Control Committee shall have the right to consider the suitability of the proposed building or structure and of the materials of which it is to be built to the building site upon which it is to be erected and the appropriateness and harmony of the contemplated improvements in relations to improvements on adjacent Lots and in relation to the general plan for the development of the Subdivision as well as the artistic and architectural merits of the proposed building or structure, its effect on the view and outlook from neighboring Lots, the extent to which its location and configuration preserves the natural attributes, including the trees thereon, of the Lot, and such other matters as may be deemed to be in the interest of the Lot Owners in the Subdivision as a whole. Any determination made by the Architectural Control Committee, in good faith, shall be binding on all parties in interest. Garage doors shall not face the front yard of a Lot. The parties acknowledge that the Activities Building is, and shall remain (including, without limitation, any remodeling thereof from time to time), architecturally distinct from the residential properties. While the Lot Owner of the Activities Building shall be required to maintain the building in good working order, and to keep an attractive appearance, the standard to be applied shall be that of a comparable commercial use building, and not a residential home.
Architectural Standards; Harmonious Plan
(b) . The plans and specifications for all buildings, structures or other improvements (including, but not limited to outbuildings, fences, decks, patios, private driveways, hedges, garages and other enclosures) to be constructed within the Subdivision shall be submitted for examination to the Architectural Control Committee. Written approval of the Architectural Control Committee to such plans and specifications shall be obtained before any building, structure or improvement shall be constructed or placed upon any Lot and before any addition, change or alteration may be made to any building, structure or other improvements situated on a Lot. The Architectural Control Committee shall approve, reject or approve with modifications all submissions within twenty (20) days after submission of the plans and specifications required hereunder to the Architectural Control Committee. Failure of the Architectural Control Committee to so respond within such period shall be deemed to be approval of the submission. The plans and specifications to be submitted shall show the size, location, type, elevations, roofline, architectural design, quality, use, construction materials and color scheme of the proposed building, structure, improvements or alteration, the grading plan for the building site and the finished grade elevation thereof. Such plans and specifications shall be prepared by a competent architect or draftsman and shall be furnished to the Architectural Control Committee in sufficient numbers so that the Architectural Control Committee may retain a true copy thereof with its records. The Architectural Control Committee, when reviewing any plans from time to time submitted for changes to the Activities Building, shall consider such plans with the point of view that the owners of the Activities Building shall be entitled to continue the same type of use of the building as previously enjoyed, and shall be entitled to remodel, repair, upgrade and, within reasonable limitation, increase the size of its operations.
Submission and Approval of Plans and Specifications
(c) . In all instances where plans and specifications are required to be submitted to and approved by the Architectural Control Committee, if subsequent to receiving such approval there shall be any variance from the approved plans and specifications in the actual construction or location of the improvement or subsequent to the completion of construction, including any change in exterior colors or materials, without the written consent of the Architectural Control Committee, such variance shall be deemed a violation of this Declaration and the Association may seek injunctive relief.
Construction in Violation of Approved Plan
(d) . Determinations by the Architectural Control Committee shall be made by a majority of the members present at any meeting. Unless waived by all members of the Committee, not less than two (2) days notice of a meeting shall be given each member in writing or by telephone at his residence. A majority of the Architectural Control Committee shall constitute a quorum. Although the Architectural Control Committee and Developer are granted by this Declaration certain discretion and rights of approval, disapproval and interpretation, the owners of Lots in the Subdivision, as further consideration for the conveyance to them of such Lots, do, for themselves, their heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns, and their successors in ownership of such Lots, by their acceptance of the conveyance of such Lots, release and forever discharge the Architectural Control Committee and developer from any claims they may have against either the Architectural Control Committee or Developer arising out of their exercise of such discretion and such rights of approval, disapproval and interpretation and/or for their failure to exercise such discretion, rights of approval, disapproval and interpretation.
Voting by Architectural Control Committee; Non-Liability for Determinations
(e) . Except for circumstances beyond the control of a Lot Owner, all buildings, structures or other improvements must be completed within one (1) year following the commencement of construction. No sod, dirt or gravel other than that incidental to construction of approved buildings, structures or other improvements shall be removed from Lots without the written approval in advance from the Architectural Control Committee. No building or structure erected in the Subdivision shall be used as a residence until the exterior thereof has been completed in accordance with the detailed plans and specifications approved therefore by the Architectural Control Committee.

The Association will be formed to serve as the owners' association for the Subdivision. The Developer is presently the sole member of the Association.
Section 1. Establishment of Association.

An owner who does not choose to build on his Lot shall still have one vote for such Lot. Any Lot Owner may cast this one (1) vote. Where a vote is cast by one (1) of two (2) or more owners of any Lot, the Association shall not be obligated to look to the authority of the owner casting the one (1) vote.
Section 3. Voting Rights.
The Board initially shall be those three (3) persons named as the initial Directors pursuant to the provisions of the Articles, or such other person or persons as may from time to time be substituted by Developer.

It shall be expressly permissible for the Association to grant easements, to the providing company, to construct and maintain the necessary lines, poles, equipment, wires, circuits and conduits on, above, across and under the Lots, so long as such lines, poles, equipment, wires, circuits and conduits do not unreasonably interfere with the use and enjoyment of the Lots. Should any utility company furnishing a service request a specific easement by separate recordable document, the Association shall have the right to grant such easement without conflicting with the terms hereof.
Section 3. Easements for Utilities.
In addition, a non-exclusive perpetual easement is hereby reserved to Developer, its successors, and assigns, for their benefit and the benefit of Lot Owners for pedestrian and vehicular access over private roadways within the Subdivision, for ingress and egress to and from the Lots and a public street.

Annual Operating Assessments Prior to Turnover Date.
(b) 
Annual Operating Assessments After the Turnover Date.
(i) Prior to the beginning of each fiscal year of the Association, the Association shall estimate, and divide equally among the Lots, the expenses of the Association consisting of the following:
(1) the estimated next fiscal year's cost of the maintenance, repair, replacement, and other services to be provided by the Association;
(2) the estimated next fiscal year's costs for insurance to be provided and paid for by the Association;
(3) the estimated next fiscal year's costs for utility services charged to or otherwise properly payable by the Association, including, without limitation, utility costs in connection with the operation of any private street lighting system;
(4) the estimated amount required to be collected to maintain a general operating reserve to assure availability of funds for normal operations of the Association, in an amount deemed adequate by the Association;
(5) an amount deemed adequate by the Association to maintain a reserve for the cost of unexpected repairs and replacements of capital improvements and for the repair and replacement of major improvements for which cash reserves over a period of time in excess of one year ought to be maintained; and
(6) the estimated next fiscal year's costs for the operation, management and administration of the Association, including, but not limited to, fees for legal and accounting services, costs of mailing, postage, supplies and materials for operating the Association, and the salaries, wages, payroll charges and other costs to perform these services, and any other costs constituting common expenses not otherwise herein specifically excluded.
(ii) The Association shall thereupon allocate such expense equally among all Lots, and thereby establish the annual operating assessment for each separate Lot.
(iii) The annual operating assessment shall be payable in advance, in equal monthly installments. Nothing shall prohibit any Lot Owner from prepaying assessments in annual, semi-annual, or quarterly increments. The due dates of any such installments shall be established by the Association.
(iv) If the amounts so collected are, at any time, insufficient to meet all obligations for which those funds are to be used, the deficiency shall be assessed by the Association among the Lots on an equal basis.
(v) If assessments collected during any fiscal year are in excess of the funds necessary to meet the anticipated expenses for which the same have been collected, the excess shall be retained as reserves, and shall in no event be deemed profits nor available, except on dissolution of the Association, for distribution to Lot Owners.
(d)
Special Assessments for Capital Improvements.
(i) In addition to the annual operating assessments, the Association may levy, in any fiscal year, special assessments to construct, reconstruct or replace capital improvements on or constituting a part of the Common Areas and/or personal property to the extent that reserves therefor are insufficient, provided that new capital improvements not replacing existing improvements shall not be constructed nor funds assessed therefor, if the cost thereof in any fiscal year would exceed an amount equal to five percent (5%) of that fiscal year's budget, without the prior consent of Lot Owners exercising no less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of Lot Owners.
(ii) Any such assessment shall be divided equally among all Lots, and shall become due and payable on such date or dates as the Association determines following written notice to the Lot Owners.
(e) The Association may levy an assessment against an individual Lot to reimburse the Association for those costs incurred properly chargeable by the terms hereof to a particular Lot (such as, but not limited to, the cost of enforcement of the Access Easement, or any other covenants and restrictions against a particular Lot, or arbitration costs properly chargeable against such Lot Owner.) Any such assessment shall become due and payable on such date as the Association determines and gives written notice to the Lot Owners subject thereto.

Written notice shall be mailed or delivered to a Lot Owner's Lot unless the Lot Owner has delivered written notice to the Association of a different address for such notices, in which event the Association shall mail such notice to the last designated address. Failure to receive such notice, for whatever reason, shall not be a defense to the Lot Owner's obligations to pay such assessment.
Section 3. Effective Date of Assessments.
Section 4. Effect of Nonpayment of Assessment; Remedies of the Association.
(a) If any assessment or any installment of any assessment is not paid within ten (10) days after the same has become due, the Association, at its option, without demand or notice, may (i) declare the entire unpaid balance of the assessment immediately due and payable; (ii) charge interest on the entire unpaid balance (or on an overdue installment, alone, if the Association has not exercised its option to declare the entire unpaid balance due and payable), at the highest rate of interest then permitted by law, or at such lower rate as the Association may from time to time determine; and (iii) charge a reasonable, uniform late fee, as determined from time to time by the Association.
(b) Annual operating and both types of special assessments, together with interest, late charges and costs, shall be a charge and a continuing lien in favor of the Association upon the Lot against which each such assessment is made.

The affidavit of lien shall contain a description of the Lot for which Assessments are unpaid, the name or names of the record owner or owners thereof, and the amount of the unpaid portion of the assessments, and shall be signed by an officer of the Association. The lien shall remain valid for a period of five (5) years from the date of filing, unless sooner paid or satisfied. The Association liens may be foreclosed in the same manner as a mortgage.
(d) Each such assessment together with interest and costs shall also be the joint and several personal obligation of the Lot Owners who owned the Lot, provided, however, that the right of the Association to any lien upon the Lot for non-payment of assessments, shall not be impaired or abridged by reason of the transfer ownership of a Lot.
The lien of the assessments and charges provided for in this Declaration shall be subject and subordinate to the lien of any duly executed first mortgage on a Lot recorded prior to the date on which such lien of the Association arises, and any holder of such first mortgage which comes into possession of a Lot pursuant to the remedies provided in the mortgage, foreclosure of the mortgage, or deed or assignment in lieu of foreclosure, and any purchaser at a foreclosure sale, shall take the property free of any claims for unpaid installments of assessments or charges against the mortgaged Lot which become due and payable prior to the time such older or purchaser took title to that Lot, provided that the Association has been made a party to such mortgage foreclosure action.
Section 5. Subordination of the Lien to First Mortgages.

Living space, for purposes of this Declaration, is enclosed space within a residential dwelling, finished, heated, and habitable. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) a Lot Owner may use a portion of a dwelling for his or her office or studio so long as those activities do not interfere with the quiet enjoyment or comfort of any other Lot Owner or Occupant, and so long as those activities do not increase the normal flow of traffic or number of individuals in and out of the property or in and out of that dwelling; and (ii) a Lot Owner or Occupant maintaining a personal or professional library, keeping personal business or professional records or accounts, or conducting personal business or professional telephone calls or correspondence, in or from a dwelling constructed on a Lot is engaging in a use expressly declared customarily incidental to principal residential use and is not in violation of these restrictions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, that portion of each Lot not containing a dwelling or structure, shall be landscaped in accordance with a landscape plan submitted to and approved by the Developer or the Association, and each such landscaped area shall thereafter be maintained in accordance with such plan.

Animals.

No Lot may be subdivided without the prior written consent of the Developer or the Association.
Conveyances.

Discrimination.
(j) The interpretation of the Developer as to the application of or any rule or regulation adopted by the Association, shall be binding upon all Lot Owners and Occupants until the Developer has sold and conveyed all Lots.

The parties acknowledge that the Activities Building is, and shall remain (including, without limitation, any remodeling thereof from time to time), architecturally distinct from the residential properties. While the Lot Owner of the Activities Building shall be required to maintain the building in good working order, and to keep an attractive appearance, the standard to be applied shall be that of a comparable commercial use building, and not a residential home.
Architectural Standards; Harmonious Plan
(b) . The plans and specifications for all buildings, structures or other improvements (including, but not limited to outbuildings, fences, decks, patios, private driveways, hedges, garages and other enclosures) to be constructed within the Subdivision shall be submitted for examination to the Architectural Control Committee. Written approval of the Architectural Control Committee to such plans and specifications shall be obtained before any building, structure or improvement shall be constructed or placed upon any Lot and before any addition, change or alteration may be made to any building, structure or other improvements situated on a Lot. The Architectural Control Committee shall approve, reject or approve with modifications all submissions within twenty (20) days after submission of the plans and specifications required hereunder to the Architectural Control Committee. Failure of the Architectural Control Committee to so respond within such period shall be deemed to be approval of the submission. The plans and specifications to be submitted shall show the size, location, type, elevations, roofline, architectural design, quality, use, construction materials and color scheme of the proposed building, structure, improvements or alteration, the grading plan for the building site and the finished grade elevation thereof. Such plans and specifications shall be prepared by a competent architect or draftsman and shall be furnished to the Architectural Control Committee in sufficient numbers so that the Architectural Control Committee may retain a true copy thereof with its records. The Architectural Control Committee, when reviewing any plans from time to time submitted for changes to the Activities Building, shall consider such plans with the point of view that the owners of the Activities Building shall be entitled to continue the same type of use of the building as previously enjoyed, and shall be entitled to remodel, repair, upgrade and, within reasonable limitation, increase the size of its operations.
Submission and Approval of Plans and Specifications
(c) . In all instances where plans and specifications are required to be submitted to and approved by the Architectural Control Committee, if subsequent to receiving such approval there shall be any variance from the approved plans and specifications in the actual construction or location of the improvement or subsequent to the completion of construction, including any change in exterior colors or materials, without the written consent of the Architectural Control Committee, such variance shall be deemed a violation of this Declaration and the Association may seek injunctive relief.
Construction in Violation of Approved Plan
(d) . Determinations by the Architectural Control Committee shall be made by a majority of the members present at any meeting. Unless waived by all members of the Committee, not less than two (2) days notice of a meeting shall be given each member in writing or by telephone at his residence. A majority of the Architectural Control Committee shall constitute a quorum. Although the Architectural Control Committee and Developer are granted by this Declaration certain discretion and rights of approval, disapproval and interpretation, the owners of Lots in the Subdivision, as further consideration for the conveyance to them of such Lots, do, for themselves, their heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns, and their successors in ownership of such Lots, by their acceptance of the conveyance of such Lots, release and forever discharge the Architectural Control Committee and developer from any claims they may have against either the Architectural Control Committee or Developer arising out of their exercise of such discretion and such rights of approval, disapproval and interpretation and/or for their failure to exercise such discretion, rights of approval, disapproval and interpretation.
Voting by Architectural Control Committee; Non-Liability for Determinations
(e) . Except for circumstances beyond the control of a Lot Owner, all buildings, structures or other improvements must be completed within one (1) year following the commencement of construction. No sod, dirt or gravel other than that incidental to construction of approved buildings, structures or other improvements shall be removed from Lots without the written approval in advance from the Architectural Control Committee. No building or structure erected in the Subdivision shall be used as a residence until the exterior thereof has been completed in accordance with the detailed plans and specifications approved therefore by the Architectural Control Committee. No trailer, basement, tent, shack, garage, barn, mobile home or other temporary shelter or housing devise shall be maintained or used as a residence, temporarily or permanently, in the Subdivision.
Commencement of Construction of Structures; Completion of Structures
(f) The Association may decide not to appoint members of the Architectural Control Committee. In the event no such members are appointed, then the Association shall have all of the rights, power and authority of the Architectural Control Committee. Any meetings or decision of the Association when acting pursuant to its rights, powers and authority of the Architectural Control Committee shall, however, be governed by its Bylaws and not Section 3(d) of this Article I.
The Association will be formed to serve as the owners' association for the Subdivision. The Developer is presently the sole member of the Association.
Section 1. Establishment of Association.
Membership in the Association shall be limited to the Developer and the Lot Owners. Every Person who is or becomes a record title owner of a fee simple interest in a Lot is a Lot Owner and shall be a member of the Association. The foregoing is not intended to include Persons who hold an interest merely as security for the performance of an obligation. Membership shall be appurtenant to and may not be separated from ownership of any Lot, and transfer of a Lot shall automatically transfer membership in the Association to the transferee of the Lot.
Section 2. Membership.
Prior to the Turnover Date, all voting power in the Association shall be vested in the Developer. From and after the Turnover Date, the owner or owners of each Lot shall be entitled to one (1) vote. An owner of more than one Lot (which shall include the Developer with respect to any unsold Lots or Lots which the Developer chooses not to sell) shall have one vote for each Lot owned. An owner who does not choose to build on his Lot shall still have one vote for such Lot. Any Lot Owner may cast this one (1) vote. Where a vote is cast by one (1) of two (2) or more owners of any Lot, the Association shall not be obligated to look to the authority of the owner casting the one (1) vote.
Section 3. Voting Rights.
The Board initially shall be those three (3) persons named as the initial Directors pursuant to the provisions of the Articles, or such other person or persons as may from time to time be substituted by Developer. The Developer shall continue to control the elections of Directors to the Board until the Turnover Date. From and after the Turnover Date, there shall be three (3) Directors elected by the Lot Owners, one (1) of which shall include the Developer as the owner of any unsold Lots. The terms of the three (3) Directors shall be staggered so that the terms of one-third of the Directors will expire and successors be elected at each annual meeting of the Association. Thereafter, at such annual meetings, successors to the Directors whose terms then expire shall be elected to serve three-year terms.
Section 4. Board of Directors.
The Association shall have the following powers and rights:
Section 5. Authority.

If the Association elects to furnish this service, all Lot Owners shall comply with the reasonable instructions of the Association with respect to the day and time of pickup, the types of containers to be used, and the location where each Lot Owner shall place refuse for pickup. In addition, if the Association elects to furnish this service, the Association shall have the right to enter into an exclusive contract with the provider of the refuse pickup service and to exclude all other providers from servicing the subject Lots.
Section 3. Refuse Services by the Association.
The Association shall obtain and maintain a comprehensive policy of general liability insurance covering all of the Common Areas, insuring the Association and the Directors, with such limits as the Board may determine, but no less than the greater of (a) the amounts generally required by private institutional mortgage investors for projects similar in construction, location and use, and (b) $1,000,000, for bodily injury, including deaths of persons, and property damage, bodily injuries and deaths of persons in connection with the operation, maintenance or use of the Common Areas, and legal liability arising out of lawsuits related to employment contracts of the Association. Each such policy must provide that it may not be canceled or substantially modified by any party, without at least (10) days' prior written notice to the Association and to each eligible holder of a mortgage on a Lot.
Section 1. Liability Insurance.
In addition, the Association may purchase and maintain contractual liability insurance, directors' and officers' liability insurance, and such other insurance as the Board may determine.
Section 2. Other Association Insurance.
Every Lot Owner shall have a right and easement of enjoyment in, over and upon the Common Areas, which rights and easements shall be appurtenant to and shall pass with the title to a Lot, subject to the right of the Association to make reasonable rules and regulations concerning the use and management of the Common Areas. In addition to the easements granted by this Declaration each Lot Owner shall have the rights and obligations as to the Driveways as established by the Access Easement executed and recorded as part of the development plan implemented by this Declaration.
Section 1. Easements of Enjoyment; Limitations.

It shall be expressly permissible for the Association to grant easements, to the providing company, to construct and maintain the necessary lines, poles, equipment, wires, circuits and conduits on, above, across and under the Lots, so long as such lines, poles, equipment, wires, circuits and conduits do not unreasonably interfere with the use and enjoyment of the Lots. Should any utility company furnishing a service request a specific easement by separate recordable document, the Association shall have the right to grant such easement without conflicting with the terms hereof.
Section 3. Easements for Utilities.
In addition, a non-exclusive perpetual easement is hereby reserved to Developer, its successors, and assigns, for their benefit and the benefit of Lot Owners for pedestrian and vehicular access over private roadways within the Subdivision, for ingress and egress to and from the Lots and a public street. Additionally, Developer, for itself and its successors and assigns, reserves the right to extend and tie into utility and sewer lines in the Lots and Common Areas, as permitted by public authority and the utility company involved, to extend such lines into other Lots in the Subdivision. Additionally, Developer reserves the right and easement for itself, its successors and assigns, to enter upon the Common Areas in order to install, maintain, repair, replace and use pipes, wires, antennas, cables, towers, conduits and other lines and facilities for the purpose of providing water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, electrical, gas, telephone, television and other utility or quasi-utility services to part or all of any Lots; to enter upon the Common Areas to the extent necessary in order to construct residential units and/or other improvements on any Lots; and to use all streets and drives within the Common Areas for purposes of ingress and egress to such Lots.
Each Lot shall be subject to an easement for encroachments created by construction, settling and overhangs, as designed or constructed by the Developer or other parties. A valid easement for said encroachments and for the maintenance of such encroaching improvements so long as such encroachment exists, shall and does exist. In the event a structure on a Lot is partially or totally destroyed, and then rebuilt, the Lot Owners of the properties so affected agree that minor encroachments of parts of the adjacent structures shall be permitted and that a valid easement for said encroachment and the maintenance thereof shall exist.
Section 4. Easement for Encroachments.
Each Lot Owner, by acceptance of a deed to a Lot, hereby irrevocably appoints the President of the Association, as his, her or its attorney-in-fact, to execute, deliver, acknowledge and record, for and in the name of such Lot Owner, such deeds of easement and other instruments as may be necessary or desirable, in the sole discretion of the Association, to further establish or effectuate the foregoing easements. This power is for the benefit of each and every Lot Owner, the Association, and the real estate to which it is applicable, runs with the land, is coupled with an interest, and is irrevocable.
Section 5. Power of Attorney.
All the roadways within the Subdivision are private streets or ways. Developer shall execute and deliver the Access Easement to the Association and shall assign any additional easement rights created by this Declaration to the Association shortly after the sale and conveyance by it of the last Lot in the Subdivision. The Driveways shall be and hereby are designated as a vehicular and pedestrian roadway for the perpetual non-exclusive use and enjoyment of all Lot Owners within the Subdivision to and from the public street named Holland-Sylvania Road. The Driveways shall be maintained, repaired and replaced by the Association as a Common Area, as provided herein.
Section 6. Private Roadway.
The easements and grants provided herein shall in no way affect any other recorded grant or easement now and hereafter.

All of such assessments to be established and collected as hereinafter provided.
Section 1. Types of Assessments.
Section 2. Elements; Apportionment; Due Dates.
(a) The Annual Operating Assessment is established for the benefit and use of the Association and shall be used in covering all of the costs of the operation, maintenance, and repair of the Driveways, landscaping and other portions of the property that the Association is obligated to repair and maintain under this Declaration, and the performance of all other duties and obligations to be performed by the Association under this Declaration.
Annual Operating Assessments Prior to Turnover Date.
(b) 
Annual Operating Assessments After the Turnover Date.
(i) Prior to the beginning of each fiscal year of the Association, the Association shall estimate, and divide equally among the Lots, the expenses of the Association consisting of the following:
(1) the estimated next fiscal year's cost of the maintenance, repair, replacement, and other services to be provided by the Association;
(2) the estimated next fiscal year's costs for insurance to be provided and paid for by the Association;
(3) the estimated next fiscal year's costs for utility services charged to or otherwise properly payable by the Association, including, without limitation, utility costs in connection with the operation of any private street lighting system;
(4) the estimated amount required to be collected to maintain a general operating reserve to assure availability of funds for normal operations of the Association, in an amount deemed adequate by the Association;
(5) an amount deemed adequate by the Association to maintain a reserve for the cost of unexpected repairs and replacements of capital improvements and for the repair and replacement of major improvements for which cash reserves over a period of time in excess of one year ought to be maintained; and
(6) the estimated next fiscal year's costs for the operation, management and administration of the Association, including, but not limited to, fees for legal and accounting services, costs of mailing, postage, supplies and materials for operating the Association, and the salaries, wages, payroll charges and other costs to perform these services, and any other costs constituting common expenses not otherwise herein specifically excluded.
(ii) The Association shall thereupon allocate such expense equally among all Lots, and thereby establish the annual operating assessment for each separate Lot.
(iii) The annual operating assessment shall be payable in advance, in equal monthly installments. Nothing shall prohibit any Lot Owner from prepaying assessments in annual, semi-annual, or quarterly increments. The due dates of any such installments shall be established by the Association.
(iv) If the amounts so collected are, at any time, insufficient to meet all obligations for which those funds are to be used, the deficiency shall be assessed by the Association among the Lots on an equal basis.
(v) If assessments collected during any fiscal year are in excess of the funds necessary to meet the anticipated expenses for which the same have been collected, the excess shall be retained as reserves, and shall in no event be deemed profits nor available, except on dissolution of the Association, for distribution to Lot Owners.
(d)
Special Assessments for Capital Improvements.
(i) In addition to the annual operating assessments, the Association may levy, in any fiscal year, special assessments to construct, reconstruct or replace capital improvements on or constituting a part of the Common Areas and/or personal property to the extent that reserves therefor are insufficient, provided that new capital improvements not replacing existing improvements shall not be constructed nor funds assessed therefor, if the cost thereof in any fiscal year would exceed an amount equal to five percent (5%) of that fiscal year's budget, without the prior consent of Lot Owners exercising no less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of Lot Owners.
(ii) Any such assessment shall be divided equally among all Lots, and shall become due and payable on such date or dates as the Association determines following written notice to the Lot Owners.
(e) The Association may levy an assessment against an individual Lot to reimburse the Association for those costs incurred properly chargeable by the terms hereof to a particular Lot (such as, but not limited to, the cost of enforcement of the Access Easement, or any other covenants and restrictions against a particular Lot, or arbitration costs properly chargeable against such Lot Owner.) Any such assessment shall become due and payable on such date as the Association determines and gives written notice to the Lot Owners subject thereto.
Special Individual Lot Assessments.
Any assessment created pursuant hereto shall be effective on the date determined by the Association. Written notice of the amount of any assessment shall be sent by the Association to the Lot Owner subject thereto at least ten (10) days prior to the due date thereof, or the due date of the first installment thereof, if to be paid in installments. Written notice shall be mailed or delivered to a Lot Owner's Lot unless the Lot Owner has delivered written notice to the Association of a different address for such notices, in which event the Association shall mail such notice to the last designated address. Failure to receive such notice, for whatever reason, shall not be a defense to the Lot Owner's obligations to pay such assessment.
Section 3. Effective Date of Assessments.
Section 4. Effect of Nonpayment of Assessment; Remedies of the Association.
(a) If any assessment or any installment of any assessment is not paid within ten (10) days after the same has become due, the Association, at its option, without demand or notice, may (i) declare the entire unpaid balance of the assessment immediately due and payable; (ii) charge interest on the entire unpaid balance (or on an overdue installment, alone, if the Association has not exercised its option to declare the entire unpaid balance due and payable), at the highest rate of interest then permitted by law, or at such lower rate as the Association may from time to time determine; and (iii) charge a reasonable, uniform late fee, as determined from time to time by the Association.
(b) Annual operating and both types of special assessments, together with interest, late charges and costs, shall be a charge and a continuing lien in favor of the Association upon the Lot against which each such assessment is made.
(c) At any time after an installment of an assessment levied pursuant hereto remains unpaid for ten (10) or more days after the same has become due and payable, an affidavit of lien regarding the non-payment of Assessments, may be filed with the Recorder of Lucas County, Ohio, pursuant to authorization given by the Association, against such Lot. The affidavit of lien shall contain a description of the Lot for which Assessments are unpaid, the name or names of the record owner or owners thereof, and the amount of the unpaid portion of the assessments, and shall be signed by an officer of the Association. The lien shall remain valid for a period of five (5) years from the date of filing, unless sooner paid or satisfied. The Association liens may be foreclosed in the same manner as a mortgage.
(d) Each such assessment together with interest and costs shall also be the joint and several personal obligation of the Lot Owners who owned the Lot, provided, however, that the right of the Association to any lien upon the Lot for non-payment of assessments, shall not be impaired or abridged by reason of the transfer ownership of a Lot.
The lien of the assessments and charges provided for in this Declaration shall be subject and subordinate to the lien of any duly executed first mortgage on a Lot recorded prior to the date on which such lien of the Association arises, and any holder of such first mortgage which comes into possession of a Lot pursuant to the remedies provided in the mortgage, foreclosure of the mortgage, or deed or assignment in lieu of foreclosure, and any purchaser at a foreclosure sale, shall take the property free of any claims for unpaid installments of assessments or charges against the mortgaged Lot which become due and payable prior to the time such older or purchaser took title to that Lot, provided that the Association has been made a party to such mortgage foreclosure action.
Section 5. Subordination of the Lien to First Mortgages.
The Association shall, upon demand, for a reasonable charge, furnish a certificate signed by an officer or designated representative of the Association, setting forth whether the assessments on a specified Lot have been paid. This certificate shall be conclusive evidence of payment of any assessment therein stated to have been paid.
Section 6. Certificate Regarding Assessments.
Except as herein provided, amendment of the Declaration (or the Articles of the Association) shall require the consent of Lot Owners exercising not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of Lot Owners. Notwithstanding the foregoing:
Section 1. Power to Amend.

(i) the method of allocating liability for common expenses;
(b) the consent of eligible holders of first mortgages on Lots to which at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the votes of Lots subject to mortgages held by eligible holders of first mortgage liens appertain shall be required to terminate the Association;
(c) amendments which solely or disproportionately affect the Activities Building shall require the consent of the Lot Owner of the Activities Building;
(d) in any event, Developer reserves the right and power, and each Lot Owner by acceptance of a deed to a Lot is deemed to and does give and grant to Developer a power of attorney, which right and power is coupled with an interest with the title to the land and is irrevocable (except by Developer), for a period of five (5) years from the date of the filing of this Declaration, to amend the Association Organizational Documents, to the extent necessary to conform to the requirements then governing the purchase or insurance of mortgages by The Mortgage Corporation, Federal National Mortgage Association, Government National Mortgage Association, Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation, the Federal Housing Administration, the Veterans Administration, or any other such agency or organization, or to correct typographical errors or obvious factual errors the correction of which would not impair the interest of any Lot Owner or mortgagee.

Any amendment adopted by the Developer or a duly empowered successor Developer pursuant to authority granted it pursuant to this Declaration shall be duly executed by them with the same formalities as the execution of this Declaration and shall contain the certification of such signors that such amendment is made pursuant to authority vested in the Developer or any duly empowered successor Developer by this Declaration.

Further, the Association and each Lot Owner shall have rights of action against each other for failure to comply with the provisions of the Association Organizational Documents, rules and regulations, and applicable law, and with respect to decisions made pursuant to authority granted thereunder, and the Association shall have the right to assess reasonable charges against a Lot Owner who fails to comply with the same, including the right to assess charges for the costs of enforcement and arbitration.

The Andersons, Inc. and Marathon to Build Ethanol Plants
HOUSTON and MAUMEE, Ohio, July 10 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/  Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO) and The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE), jointly announced today that the companies have signed a letter of intent which could lead to the formation of a 50/50 joint venture that would construct and operate a number of ethanol plants. The formation of the joint venture and other related activities are subject to approval by each company's board of directors and the execution of definitive agreements.
"Marathon is one of the nation's leading blenders of ethanol in gasoline and has been doing so for more than 15 years," says Gary R. Heminger, executive vice president of Marathon Oil Corporation and president of the company's refining, marketing and transportation operations. "We see the partnership with The Andersons as an important step in maintaining the reliability of future ethanol supplies and in furthering our commitment to meet the needs of the motoring public in progressive and innovative ways."
"We are pleased to be partnering with Marathon in the pursuit of ethanol as an alternative fuel source," says The Andersons, Inc. president and CEO Mike Anderson. "We believe our strategic relationship is a natural extension of both of the companies' rich histories in our respective industries. The Andersons has a strong tradition of service in grain markets, and recently has begun construction, management and development of ethanol plants. Marathon represents years of petroleum refining and distribution experience. Additionally, both companies have strategic interests in ethanol production and similar philosophies regarding the impact ethanol will have on American consumers and our environment."
The Andersons will provide day-to-day management of the ethanol plants, as well as corn origination, risk management, and dry distillers grain and ethanol marketing services. Site selection is expected to be finalized soon. The initial plant is expected to have a nameplate annual production capacity of 110 million gallons of ethanol. Timing of construction is contingent upon selection, regulatory requirements, permitting and economic incentives.

The Andersons, Inc. Reports 2nd Quarter Results
First Half Results Set New Records
MAUMEE, Ohio, July 28 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/  The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE), today announced second-quarter net income of $10.3 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, and total revenues of $378 million. In the same three-month period of 2005, the company reported net income of $10.4 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, on $365 million of revenues. For the first six months of 2006, the company's net income was $14.2 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, on revenues of $659 million. These first half net income and per share earnings established new records for the company. In the first half of 2005, The Andersons earned $11.4 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, on revenues of $624 million. All of the earnings per share data have been adjusted to reflect the June 28, 2006 2-for-1 stock split.
The Grain & Ethanol Group's second-quarter operating income of $1.9 million was $3.3 million better than its year earlier result. Total revenues of $149 million for the period were $16 million higher than the second quarter of 2005. The number of bushels handled by the group's elevators was higher than the prior period, and average gross sales margins were also higher. Although space income was lower than last year in the second quarter, total gross profit increased. The group's investment in its commodity trading affiliate, Lansing Trade Group, LLC, also achieved earnings growth in the most recent three-month period. Through the first half of 2006, the Grain & Ethanol Group achieved operating income of $3.7 million. In the same period last year, operating income was $0.4 million. During the past year, the group has invested in three limited liability companies which are constructing ethanol production facilities in Michigan and Indiana. The Andersons is a significant investor in two of these projects and will provide general management, ethanol and DDGS marketing, and risk management services to them and offers these services to other ethanol producers as well. The plant located in Albion, Michigan, is scheduled to begin production in August. The Grain & Ethanol Group's second quarter results include the impact of employee recruiting, training and some other pre-opening expenses associated with the ethanol business. The group has also recently announced its intent to form a joint venture with Marathon Oil to build and operate additional ethanol facilities.
The Rail Group's operating income of $5.0 million in the second quarter of 2006 was $1.2 million higher than it earned in the same three-month period a year ago. Revenues of $28 million for the quarter were $10 million higher than the prior period. The group's railcar fleet utilization rate (the percentage of the fleet in service at the end of the period) has also increased over time. At the end of June 2006 it stood at 95 percent. The group realized some gains from the sale of railcars and related leases during the quarter, and income from the leasing business in total improved versus the prior year. Operating income from the group's railcar repair and manufacturing businesses was also higher in the second quarter. In the first half of 2006, the group achieved revenues of $62 million and $11.2 million of operating income. Last year, it reported revenues of $35 million and operating income of $7.4 million for the first half of 2005.
The Plant Nutrient Group had revenues of $113 million and operating income of $5.0 million in the second quarter this year. It earned $10.3 million on $120 million of revenues during the same three-month period of 2005. With much higher energy and nutrient input costs, the company believes that farmers have reduced the amount of nutrients applied to their fields this year, essentially keeping spending in line with last year. With volume and average gross margins both down, the group's second-quarter gross profit declined significantly from last year. Through the first half of 2006, the group's operating income was $3.8 million on $159 million of revenues. In the same period last year, operating income amounted to $9.5 million on $164 million of revenues.
The Turf and Specialty Group continued to achieve improved results during the most recent quarter. For the period, the group's operating income was $1.3 million on $33 million of revenues. In 2005, it earned $0.4 million of operating income in the second quarter on $40 million of revenues. The group's lawn and cob products businesses both contributed to this improvement. Through the first six months of this year, the group has reported operating income of $3.5 million and revenues of $73 million. In the first half of 2005, the group had revenues of $81 million and $1.5 million of income. During the past year, this group has restructured its businesses, reduced costs, improved operating efficiency, and focused on the products and markets where it can add the most value, which has allowed the group to increase profitability in spite of reduced revenue.
The Retail Group reported revenues of $55 million for the second quarter of 2006, an increase of 0.7 percent in same-store sales from the same period in 2005. With higher gross profit generated by the increase in sales, and a slight reduction in expenses, the group's operating income was $4.2 million for the quarter, about $0.3 million above the same period last year. For the first half of the year, the group generated revenues of $87 million and operating income of $1.7 million. In the first half of 2005, it also had operating income of $1.7 million but slightly higher revenues of $89 million.
President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson reports that "for the following reasons, I believe the company's earnings prospects for the 2006 calendar year have strengthened versus earlier forecasts." Mr. Anderson explains: "We're about to begin production of ethanol at the new plant in Albion, Michigan ahead of schedule, and ethanol economics are stronger now than our earlier projections envisioned. In addition, the prospects for an excellent grain harvest in our region are even better now than we thought earlier, we continue to achieve growth in our rail business, our turf and specialty business is performing better than anticipated, and our investment in Lansing Trade Group is doing very well. Our estimate of the business interruption insurance settlement related to the accident at one of our elevators last year is also higher now that more specific data is available. The guidance we issued in early May, adjusted for the subsequent stock split, indicated that we expected to earn $1.70 to $1.90 per diluted share this year. While there is still a lot of time left in the growing season, and several other things such as the ethanol plant launch have to be executed well, it now appears that a range of $1.90 to $2.10 for our full-year earnings per share is a reasonable expectation. These per share estimates do not take into account the pending issuance of additional shares pursuant to our announced stock offering, which is not yet final. We will, of course, continue to evaluate our earnings projections as we progress through the year."
The company will host a webcast today at 2:00 P.M. ET, to discuss its second-quarter performance and full-year outlook. This can be accessed under the heading "Investor Relations" on its website at http://www.andersonsinc.com.

     (iii) To cooperate to the extent necessary to cause the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto to become effective at the earliest possible time and to do and perform all things to be done and performed under this Agreement prior to the applicable Time of Delivery and to satisfy all conditions precedent to the delivery of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement;

It is understood, however, that except as provided in this Section, and Sections 8 and 11 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, and stock transfer taxes on resale of any of the Shares by them, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make. It is further understood that, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall affect any agreement that the Company and the Selling Shareholders may make for the sharing or allocation of such costs or expenses.

     (h) On or after the date hereof there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) any United States federal or state statute, regulation, rule or order of any court, legislative body, agency or other Governmental Authority shall have been enacted, published, decreed or promulgated or any proceeding or investigation shall have been commenced which, in your judgment, makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Shares being delivered at such Time of Delivery on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the Nasdaq; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either federal or New York or Delaware authorities; (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities or an act of terrorism involving or affecting the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, if the effect of any such event specified in this clause (iv) in your judgment makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Shares being delivered at such Time of Delivery on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus; or (v) such a change in general economic, political, financial or international conditions affecting financial markets in the United States having such an impact on trading prices of securities in general or otherwise, as, in your judgment, makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Shares being delivered at such Time of Delivery on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Disclosure Package;

8. Indemnification and Contribution
     (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in (i) any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, (ii) any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or (iii) any Permitted Issuer Information used or referred to in any "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405 of the Rules and Regulations) used or referred to by any Underwriter, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and promptly will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any
provided
 
amendment or supplement thereto or in any Permitted Issuer Information in reliance upon and in conformity with, in the case of an Underwriter, written information furnished to the Company through the Representatives by or on behalf of any Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein. The Company acknowledges that the only information furnished through the Representatives by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of statements set forth in the third, seventh, twelfth, fourteenth and sixteenth paragraphs in "Underwriting."
     (b) Each of the Selling Shareholders will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or such Underwriter may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to a Selling Shareholder furnished to the Company in writing by such Selling Shareholder expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company and each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
     (c) Each Underwriter will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each Selling Shareholder from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or such Selling Shareholder may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company and each Selling Shareholder for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company and each Selling Shareholder in
 
connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred. The Company acknowledges that the only information furnished to the Company through the Representatives by or on behalf of any Underwriter specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) are the statements set forth in Section 8(a) above.
     (d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     (e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Shareholders in question, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the Shares. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (d) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Selling Shareholders in question, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Shareholders, on the one hand,
 
and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Shares purchased under this Agreement (after deducting the total underwriting discount, but before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Selling Shareholders in question bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions payable to the Underwriters in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Selling Shareholders, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, each of the Selling Shareholders and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (e). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (e) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (e) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
     (f) The obligations of the Company and the Selling Shareholders under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability that the Company and the respective Selling Shareholder may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company and Selling Shareholder within the meaning of the Securities Act.
     (g) The liability of each Selling Shareholder under the indemnity and contribution provisions of this Section 8 shall be limited to an amount equal to the initial public offering price of the Shares sold by such Selling Shareholder, less the underwriting discount, as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus.
9. Default of Underwriters
     (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Shares that it has agreed to purchase hereunder at a Time of Delivery, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Shares on the terms contained herein. If within
 
36 hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Shares, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Shares on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Shares, or the Company notifies you that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Shares, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone such Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion, exercised in consultation with Hunton & Williams LLP, may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Shares.
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Shares that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate number of all of the Shares to be purchased at such Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Shares that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder at such Time of Delivery and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the number of Shares which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Shares of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

The Andersons, Inc.
480 W. Dussel Drive
Maumee, Ohio 43537
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE            AT THE COMPANY: Gary Smith (419) 891  6417 WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 2006
, today announced third-quarter net income of $8.4 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, and total revenues of $336 million. In the same three-month period of 2005, the company reported a net loss of $0.6 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, on $289 million of revenues. For the first nine months of 2006, the company's net income was $22.6 million, or $1.41 per diluted share, on revenues of $995 million. In the first nine months of 2005, The Andersons earned net income of $10.8 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, on revenues of $913 million. The third quarter and nine months results this year both established new records for the company. All of the earnings per share data have been adjusted to reflect the June 2006 stock split. During the quarter, the company raised $81.6 million of additional equity to support its growth initiatives and strengthen its balance sheet.
MAUMEE, OHIO, NOVEMBER 1, 2006The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Grain & Ethanol Group's third-quarter operating income of $12.0 million was $14.5 million better than its year-earlier result. Total revenues of $209 million for the period were $50 million higher than the third quarter of 2005. Total grain gross profit for the period was also significantly higher than it had been in the previous year. This included the sale of a large number of wheat bushels at excellent margins during the period and appreciation in corn basis values more usually seen in the fourth quarter. The group's third quarter operating income also included the settlement of the 2005 portion of the business interruption insurance claim related to an elevator in Toledo which had been damaged by an explosion and fire in the third quarter of 2005. Now that the elevator has re-opened and is receiving grain, the company is actively working on the 2006 portion of the business interruption claim. Because of the degree of volatility in recent wheat and ethanol markets, the group's investment in its commodity trading affiliate, Lansing Trade Group, LLC, incurred a loss during the most recent three-month period, although its income remains at a record level through nine months. Construction of an ethanol plant in Albion, Michigan, in which The Andersons, Inc. is a significant investor, was completed during the third quarter, and the plant began to produce and ship ethanol and distillers dried grain. Construction of another ethanol plant, located in Clymers, Indiana, is underway and scheduled to start production by the end of the first quarter of 2007. Through the first nine months of 2006, the Grain & Ethanol Group achieved operating income of $15.7 million. In the same period last year, the group incurred an operating loss of $2.1 million.
The Rail Group's operating income of $4.9 million in the third quarter of 2006 was $0.9 million below its third quarter 2005 results. Revenues of $27 million for the quarter were $4 million higher than the prior period. Railcar lease rates and the utilization rate of the group's railcar fleet remained strong during the third quarter of 2006, but fleet maintenance costs were higher. Operating income during the period from the group's railcar repair and manufacturing businesses was higher than the third quarter of 2005. Through the first nine months of 2006, the group achieved revenues of $90 million and $16.1 million of operating income. Last year, it reported revenues of $59 million and operating income of $13.3 million for the same nine month period.
The Plant Nutrient Group incurred an operating loss of $1.9 million on $39 million of revenues in the third quarter this year. It lost $0.8 million on $47 million of revenues during the same three-month period of 2005. Because energy and nutrient input costs through the third quarter have been significantly higher this year, the company believes that farmers reduced the amount of nutrients applied to their fields this season. This resulted in reduced wholesale and retail demand for plant nutrients and a deferral of pre-fall season purchasing. With volume down, the group's third-quarter gross profit declined from last year. Through the first nine months of 2006, the group's operating income was $1.9 million on $198 million of revenues. In the same period last year, operating income amounted to $8.7 million on $211 million of revenues.
The Turf and Specialty Group continued to achieve improved results during the most recent quarter. For the period, the group's operating loss amounted to $0.4 million on $20 million of revenues. In 2005, it incurred an operating loss of $3.0 million in the third quarter on $19 million of revenues. The group's lawn and cob products businesses both contributed to this improvement. Also included in this year's third quarter income was the settlement of an insurance claim regarding a storage tank that was damaged last year. Through the first nine months of this year, the group has reported operating income of $3.1 million and revenues of $93 million. In the first nine months of 2005, the group had revenues of $101 million and an operating loss of $1.6 million. The improved third quarter and year-to-date results were primarily due to restructuring actions and other charges incurred in the third quarter of 2005.
The Retail Group reported revenues of $41 million for the third quarter of 2006, an increase of 1.3 percent in same-store sales from the same period in 2005. With higher gross margins and total gross profit, the group's operating loss was $0.4 million for the quarter, about $0.4 million better than the same period last year. For the first nine months of the year, the group generated revenues of $128 million and operating income of $1.3 million. In the first nine months of 2005, it reported operating income of $0.9 million and revenues of $130 million.
According to President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson "We've frequently noted that it's not unusual for some of our units to experience volatility in quarterly income over and above normal seasonal patterns. This has often been true in our commodity-based grain and plant nutrient businesses, and to some degree in our rail business, given the unpredictable timing of opportunistic railcar sales. With our strong third-quarter income this year, one might conclude that our prospects for the full year had noticeably improved. There are several variables which could still swing either way. Supply and demand dynamics in the grain markets, including rainfalls that have delayed the fall harvest, will impact fourth quarter income. Accordingly, I believe that our previously-announced guidance of $1.90 to $2.10 for our 2006 full-year earnings per diluted share is still a reasonable expectation. There are also some non-recurring items which, if they were to occur prior to year-end, could raise this guidance range. These include the 2006 portion of our elevator business interruption claim and additional ethanol development activities."
The company will host a webcast on Thursday, November 2, 2006 at 11:00 A.M. ET, to discuss its third-quarter performance and full-year outlook. This can be accessed under the heading "Financial Information" on its website at .

, today announced its 2006 results, with full-year net income at $36.3 million, or $2.19 per diluted share, on $1.5 billion of revenues. In 2005, the company's full-year net income was $26.1 million, or $1.69 per diluted share, and total revenues were $1.3 billion. Fourth-quarter net income in 2006 was $13.8 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, and total revenues were $463 million. In the same three-month period of 2005, the company reported net income of $15.3 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, on $384 million of revenues.
MAUMEE, OHIO, FEBRUARY 8, 2007The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Grain and Ethanol Group's full-year operating income of $27.9 million in 2006 established a new record, $15.3 million higher than the $12.6 million it achieved in 2005, the group's previous best full-year performance. Operating income of $12.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 was below the $14.8 million the group generated a year earlier. The number of grain bushels delivered to The Andersons' elevators increased slightly this year. Total grain gross profit and operating income also improved for the year, despite reduced earnings from grain storage attributable in part to higher interest costs. The group's emerging ethanol business continued to register income growth during the most recent quarter. The group's Albion, Michigan ethanol plant, in which The Andersons, Inc. is a significant investor, began production during the third quarter and shipped ethanol and distillers dried grain to customers throughout the fourth quarter of 2006. Construction of its Clymers, Indiana plant, in which the company also is a significant investor, is progressing well and is scheduled to start producing ethanol early in the second quarter of 2007. Recently construction also began on a Greenville, Ohio plant, which is expected to begin operations in early 2008. The group's investment in Lansing Trade Group, LLC exceeded its 2005 fourth-quarter income in the most recent three-month period and achieved significant income growth for the full year.
The Rail Group's 2006 revenues of $113 million exceeded 2005 by $21 million. Full-year operating income in 2006 was $19.5 million. In 2005, the group had operating income of $22.8 million on $92 million of revenues. Income from the rail leasing business was lower this year because gains from the sale of railcars were down since fewer cars were liquidated in 2006, and maintenance costs were higher. The group's railcar fleet continued to grow in 2006, and the utilization rate of the fleet remained high. Revenues and income from the group's railcar repair and manufacturing businesses also continued to increase this year. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the group generated total revenues of $33 million and $9.5 million of operating income, including a significant amount from the liquidation of some railcars. Without a similar sale during the fourth quarter this year, the group's fourth-quarter 2006 revenues of $24 million and operating income of $3.4 million were below its 2005 results.
The Plant Nutrient Group's revenues were $265 million in 2006, and its operating income was $3.3 million. In 2005, its revenues amounted to $271 million and operating income was $10.4 million. The company believes that farmers reduced the amount of nutrients applied to their fields in response to significantly higher energy and nutrient input costs during the important 2006 planting and growing seasons. This resulted in lower wholesale and retail demand for plant nutrients including a deferral of fall season purchasing, and a reduction in the group's gross profit and operating income. In the fourth-quarter of 2006, the group had operating income of $1.3 million on $67 million of revenues. In 2005, fourth-quarter revenues were $60 million, and operating income was $1.7 million.
The Turf and Specialty Group's full-year operating income was $3.2 million in 2006, on $111 million of revenues. In 2005, the group incurred an operating loss of $3.0 million, on revenues of $123 million. The year-to-year improvement resulted from a change in the group's business model which realigned staffing and assets in both the turf and cob products businesses. In the fourth quarter, the group typically incurs an operating loss due to the seasonal nature of its businesses. This year it achieved a slight operating profit for the quarter on revenues of $18 million. During the same three-month period in 2005, the group incurred an operating loss of $1.5 million, with revenues of $22 million.
The Retail Group achieved an operating income of $3.2 million in 2006. This was $0.3 million higher than its 2005 performance. Revenues amounted to $177 million in 2006, down 3.0 percent from 2005. Improved average gross margins were partially offset by lower average sales per transaction and increased operating expenses. The group's fourth-quarter operating income of $1.9 million was slightly below its year-earlier result. During the quarter, the group began construction of a smaller-format food-only store in Sylvania, Ohio. The new "Andersons Market" is scheduled to open in the spring of 2007.
"We've been making a lot of changes throughout the company during the past two years, and they're showing some very positive results," said President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson. "Our strategic decision to enter the ethanol business is definitely having an impact, as is our continued growth in Rail, our investment in Lansing Trade Group, restructuring in Turf and Specialty, and other process improvements throughout the company. As a result, in spite of the really tough market realities encountered by our Plant Nutrient Group this year, we beat our previous net income record by 39 percent. This successful growth benefits all of our constituents  our customers, our employees, our communities, and of course, our shareholders. With the Clymers, Indiana ethanol plant scheduled to begin production two months from now, and continued growth in our rail business, we look forward to continued positive progress in the coming year."
The company will host a webcast on Friday, February 9, 2007 at 11:00 A.M. ET, to discuss its fourth quarter and full-year performance. This can be accessed under the heading "Investor Relations" on its website at .

The Andersons, Inc.
480 W. Dussel Drive
Maumee, Ohio 43537
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE            AT THE COMPANY: Gary Smith (419) 891  6417 WEDNESDAY, MAY 2, 2007
, today announced first-quarter revenues of $409 million and net income of $9.2 million, or $0.51 per diluted share. In the same three-month period of 2006, the company reported net income of $3.8 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, on $281 million of revenues.
MAUMEE, OHIO, MAY 2, 2007The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Grain & Ethanol Group achieved operating income of $10.2 million in the most recent quarter, more than five times the $1.8 million it earned in the first quarter of 2006. Total revenues were $247 million for the period. This included more than $30 million of ethanol sales made by the group in accordance with a marketing agreement between the company and its new Albion ethanol joint venture. In the first quarter of 2006, the group's total revenues were $129 million. The group's grain business sold more bushels than during last year's first quarter, and average grain prices were more than 40 percent above year-earlier levels. The business also benefited from two other items, improved income from its grain storage, and fee income for originating corn for the ethanol companies in which it is a significant investor. The group's ethanol business also achieved income growth during the most recent quarter. The Albion, Michigan plant was still under construction through the first two-thirds of 2006, but is in full operation this year. In the first quarter of 2007, the group also realized $5.4 million of income from non-recurring development fees associated with the new ethanol plants. Last year, the group received $1.9 million of ethanol development fees in the first quarter. Another new plant in which the group is a significant investor, this one located in Clymers, Indiana, is commencing ethanol production this week. First quarter income from the group's investment in the Lansing Trade Group LLC was lower this year.
The Rail Group's operating income of $3.0 million in the first quarter of 2007 was down $3.2 million from the same three-month period a year ago. Revenues of $26 million for the quarter were $8 million lower. Although the group sold some railcars during the quarter, its total fleet at the end of March had increased by more than 1,800 railcars over the past twelve months, but the utilization rate (the percentage of the fleet in service at the end of the period) had decreased from 95 percent a year ago to 93 percent at the end of March this year. Overall U.S. rail traffic has declined by nearly 5 percent compared to the first quarter of 2006, and demand for most car types has dropped. Since fewer railcars were sold in the first quarter of 2007 than had been sold in the comparable period last year, and maintenance costs on the group's fleet were higher, total revenues and operating income in the railcar leasing business were down. A slowdown in the group's manufacturing business and in its railcar repair business following completion of the post-Katrina surge of railcars requiring refurbishment also contributed to the decline in the group's operating income.
The Plant Nutrient Group achieved operating income of $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2007 on $67 million of revenues. In this highly seasonal industry, the first quarter is typically a loss period. Last year the group incurred an operating loss of $1.2 million during the quarter on revenues of $46 million. The revenue increase and improved bottom line was due to higher prices for the group's products, slightly better margins, and increased tonnage sold as dealers stocked up in anticipation of a large increase in U.S corn acres this season and anticipated tightness in nutrient supplies during planting.
The Turf & Specialty Group achieved operating income of $1.8 million on $36 million of revenues during the first quarter this year. Last year, it reported $2.1 million of income and $40 million of revenues for the period. Turf products tonnage was lower in the first quarter due to heavy buying by distributors late last year and wintry weather in March this year. In spite of record high raw material prices this year, average gross margins in the lawn business were higher as a result of the introduction of several new value-added products. The group's cob products business experienced increased raw material costs in the first quarter this year due to tight raw material supplies.
The Retail Group reported revenues of $33.8 million for the first quarter of 2007, an increase of 5.2 percent in same-store sales from the same period in 2006, in part due to continued growth in food and wine categories and strong sales of cold-weather goods with the late winter conditions this year. For the three month period, the Retail Group incurred an operating loss of $2.3 million this year, slightly improved from the $2.4 million loss incurred in the first quarter of 2006. Last week the group opened a food-only store in Sylvania, Ohio, a suburb of Toledo. The new 31,000 square foot store, known as The Andersons Market, features an expanded line of basic groceries plus all of the deli, bakery, produce, fresh and frozen meats, specialty foods, wines and related products that are offered in the group's much larger stores.
"We feel good about our overall performance so far this year. While Rail is being impacted by some industry-wide softness, and part of our earnings were from non-recurring items, the Grain and Ethanol, Plant Nutrient, and Retail businesses all contributed to our income growth during the period," said President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson. "Our new Andersons Market has just opened and is being favorably received by area shoppers, the Clymers plant is starting to produce ethanol this week, and the huge increase in corn plantings this spring should benefit our grain, ethanol and plant nutrient businesses. All considered, I'm optimistic about our company's future."
Mr. Anderson also stated "Looking at our 2007 earnings prospects, numerous factors will have a bearing on the full-year outcome: weather patterns during the important agricultural planting and growing season within our region, the number of acres switched to corn from other crops, nutrient and energy commodity prices, railcar values and lease rates, retail and professional demand for lawn and garden products, and a successful launch of the ethanol plant in Clymers, Indiana. Given all of these variables and the picture we see before us today, we anticipate that our full-year 2007 earnings will be within a range from $2.35 to $2.60 per diluted share."
The company will host a webcast on Thursday, May 3, 2007 at 11:00 A.M. ET, to discuss its performance and full year outlook. This can be accessed under the heading "Investor Relations" on its website at .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE            AT THE COMPANY: Gary Smith (419) 891  6417 WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 1, 2007
, today announced that its second-quarter and first-half net income and per-share earnings established new records for the company, more than doubling its best previous performances. Net income was $25.5 million, or $1.40 per diluted share in the second quarter this year, and total revenues were $634 million. In the same three-month period of 2006, the company reported net income of $10.3 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, on $378 million of revenues. For the first six months of 2007, the company's net income was $34.7 million, or $1.90 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.04 billion. In the first half of 2006, The Andersons earned $14.2 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, on revenues of $659 million.
MAUMEE, OHIO, AUGUST 1, 2007The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The company's Grain & Ethanol Group achieved operating income of $12.0 million in the most recent quarter, significantly above the $1.9 million it earned in the second quarter of 2006. Total revenues were $324 million for the period. This included $57 million of ethanol sales made by the group in accordance with marketing agreements between the company and its ethanol joint ventures. In the second quarter of 2006, the group's total revenues were $149 million. Grain benefited from improved storage income and fee income for originating corn for ethanol companies, including those in which it is a significant investor. Ethanol also achieved income growth during the most recent quarter. The Albion, Michigan plant, which commenced production of ethanol during the second half of last year, was in operation throughout the second quarter this year, and the plant in Clymers, Indiana began production of ethanol this spring. Second-quarter income from the group's investment in the Lansing Trade Group LLC was lower this year. Through the first six months of 2007, the Grain & Ethanol Group's operating income was $22.2 million, or $18.5 million higher than the first half of 2006. Total year-to-date revenues this year were $568 million. In 2006, the group's first half revenues were $277 million.
The Rail Group's operating income of $6.9 million in the second quarter of 2007 was $1.9 million more than it achieved in the same three-month period a year ago. Revenues of $42 million for the quarter were up $14 million. The group's railcar fleet increased by about 16 percent from its June 2006 total. However, its utilization rate (the percentage of the fleet's railcars in service at the end of the period) decreased somewhat from a year ago. Including some gains from railcar sales made during the second quarter, operating income in the group's leasing business was higher than its year-earlier results, but its railcar repair and manufacturing businesses experienced lower operating income in total for the quarter. The group's first half operating income this year was $9.9 million on $68 million of revenues. In 2006, operating income through the first six months was $11.2 million and revenues amounted to $62 million.
The Plant Nutrient Group achieved operating income of $17.1 million in the second quarter of 2007 on $183 million of revenues. The application of nutrients in conjunction with the planting of agricultural crops throughout the U.S. each spring makes the second quarter the key selling season for this group. This was especially true this year. A large increase in U.S. corn acreage this spring helped the group achieve by far its best-ever quarterly operating income. In 2006, the group's operating income was $5.0 million for the quarter, on $113 million of revenues. The group's first half operating income this year was $17.5 million on $249 million of revenues. Last year, its operating income through the first six months was $3.8 million and revenues amounted to $159 million.
The Turf & Specialty Group had operating income of $0.7 million in the second quarter this year on $30 million of revenues. Last year, it reported $1.3 million of income and $33 million of revenues for the period. Turf products tonnage was lower in the second quarter this year due to relatively dry weather throughout much of the country which curtailed sales of some formulated products. While raw material prices remained high by historical standards, average lawn products gross margins increased slightly as a result of several new value-added products. Through the first half of 2007, the group's operating income was $2.5 million on $67 million of revenues. Last year, its operating income was $3.5 million for the same period, and revenues amounted to $73 million.
The Retail Group reported total revenues of $55 million for the most recent quarter. Same-store sales were down 2.9 percent for the period. Sales of some lawn & garden products were clearly impacted by the dry weather this spring. For this three-month period, the group achieved operating income of $3.6 million. In the comparable period last year, the group's operating income was $4.2 million with revenues of $55 million. The group's six-months to-date operating income this year was $1.3 million on $89 million of revenues. Last year, operating income through June was $1.7 million, and total revenues stood at $87 million.
"Our second-quarter and first-half results are gratifying," said President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson. "The entire Plant Nutrient team did an excellent job in responding to unprecedented market demand this spring, our Grain & Ethanol businesses continued to achieve significant income growth, and we were again able to expand our railcar fleet."
Mr. Anderson also stated, "In mid-June it became apparent that the spring season in our agriculture-related businesses was stronger than we had expected, and we had also begun production of ethanol at the Clymers, Indiana plant which had been under construction for the past year. As a result, we announced that our full-year earnings outlook had improved. While there are still a couple of months left in the growing season this year, and it has been drier than normal in parts of our eastern corn belt region, we now believe that our 2007 full-year earnings will be within a range from $2.90 to $3.15 per diluted share."
The company will host a webcast on Thursday, August 2, 2007 at 11:00 A.M. ET, to discuss its performance and full year outlook. This can be accessed under the heading "Investor Relations" on its website at .

, today announced that its third quarter and first nine months net income and earnings per diluted share established new records for the company. Net income was $10.6 million, or $0.58 per diluted share for the third quarter, and total revenues were $554 million. In the same three month period of 2006, the company reported net income of $8.4 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, on revenues of $336 million. During the first nine months of 2007, the company earned net income of $45.3 million, or $2.48 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.6 billion. The company more than doubled the net income of $22.6 million earned during the first nine months of 2006, or $1.41 per diluted share, on revenues of $995 million.
MAUMEE, OHIO, OCTOBER 31, 2007The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Grain & Ethanol Group's third quarter operating income of $13.7 million was $1.8 million better than its year earlier result, which had included a 2006 gain of $4.2 million from a business interruption insurance claim. Total revenues were $383 million for the period. This included $85 million of ethanol sales made by the group in accordance with marketing agreements between the company and its ethanol joint ventures, for which it receives a fee. In the third quarter of 2006, the group's total revenues were $209 million and did not include any sales from the ethanol joint ventures. Income from ethanol joint ventures grew significantly during the most recent quarter. Both the Albion, Michigan and Clymers, Indiana ethanol plants were in operation during the entire third quarter, which was the first quarter both plants were in full operation. In addition, third quarter income from the group's investment in Lansing Trade Group LLC (LTG) was significantly higher this year. Through the first nine months of 2007, the Grain & Ethanol Group's operating income was $35.9 million, which is more than double the $15.7 million earned for the same period in 2006. Total revenues through September were $950 million, including $171 million in sales of ethanol. In comparison, the group's revenues for the first nine months of the prior year were $486 million and did not include any sales of ethanol from the ethanol joint ventures. Total revenues in the Grain & Ethanol Group have increased for both the quarter and nine months due to an increase in bushels sold, a considerable increase in the average price of the grains sold, and an increase in the gallons of ethanol sold.
The Rail Group's operating income of $5.8 million in the third quarter of 2007 was $0.9 million above the $4.9 million it earned in the same three month period in 2006. Revenues of $34 million for the quarter were up from $27 million in the same period of the prior year. The group now has approximately 22,600 cars and locomotives; this compares to about 20,400 cars and locomotives in the prior year. The group's average lease rates for new transactions and utilization rate (the percentage of the fleet's railcars in service at the end of the period) have decreased from a year ago due to softness in the overall rail leasing market. Including some gains from railcar sales and related leases entered into during the third quarter, operating income in the group's leasing business was higher than its year earlier results. Absent gains from sales, operating income from leasing was slightly lower. The railcar repair and manufacturing businesses also continued to experience lower operating income during the third quarter. Through the first nine months of the year the Rail Group had operating income of $15.7 million on $102 million of revenues. In 2006, operating income through the same period was $16.1 million and revenues amounted to $90 million.
The Plant Nutrient Group achieved operating income of $0.8 million during the third quarter of 2007; this is the first time in the history of the group that they have reported a profit in the third quarter. Total revenues were $77 million for the period. This represents a significant improvement from the same three month period in 2006 when the group reported a $1.9 million operating loss on $39 million of revenues. The net income record resulted from significant increases in both margin and volume. The third quarter volume increase is the result of customers buying earlier and more aggressively due to the escalation of nutrient prices and to replenish depleted fertilizer stockpiles left virtually empty at the end of the second quarter. The group's operating income for the first nine months was $18.4 million on $326 million of revenues. Last year, its operating income through the same period was $1.9 million and revenues were $198 million. The record quarter and year to date income and revenues for the group have been influenced by the significant increase in corn acreage, and nutrient inventory appreciation.
The Turf & Specialty Group incurred an operating loss of $1.6 million in the third quarter this year on $18 million of revenues. Last year, the group reported an operating loss of $0.4 million and revenues of $20 million for the period. Included in the 2006 earnings was a $0.4 million gain from the settlement of an insurance claim. Turf products tonnage continued to be lower in the third quarter due to relatively dry weather throughout much of the country which curtailed sales of some formulated products. Through the first nine months of 2007, the group's operating income was $0.9 million on $85 million of revenues. Last year, its operating income was $3.1 million for the same period, and revenues were $93 million.
The Retail Group reported an operating loss of $0.6 million for the third quarter of 2007; this compares to an operating loss of $0.4 million in the prior year. Revenues were $42 million for the quarter. Although total revenues were up from $41 million in the prior year due to the addition of the Sylvania, Ohio, Food Market, same store sales were down 1.6 percent for the period. The group's nine months to date operating income this year was $0.8 million on $131 million of revenues. Last year, operating income through September was $1.3 million, and total revenues were $128 million. The year to year income differential is caused primarily by competitive sales pressure in the Toledo area market and the performance of the new Sylvania Food Market.
"Our Grain and Ethanol and Plant Nutrient Groups are achieving excellent income growth this year, and the Rail Group is maintaining solid performance despite some tightening in that industry, which more than compensates for the softness being experienced in other segments" said President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson. Mr. Anderson added, "A few weeks ago it became apparent that the results of our agriculture related businesses were stronger than we had expected. As a result, we announced on October 17th that our full-year earnings outlook had improved to be within a range of $3.15 to $3.35 per diluted share. While there are still various factors that could impact our full year results such as supply and demand dynamics in the grain and plant nutrient markets, timing of railcar sales, and investment results of LTG, we continue to believe this is the right guidance at this time."
The company will host a webcast on Thursday, November 1, 2007 at 11:00 A.M. ET, to discuss its performance and full year outlook. This can be accessed under the heading "Investor Relations" on its website at .

The Andersons, Inc. issued a press release on February 6, 2007, reporting fourth quarter and year-to-date 2007 earnings. This press release is attached as exhibit 99 to this filing.

, today announced that both its full year and fourth quarter results established new records for the company. For the full year, net income was $68.8 million, or $3.75 per diluted share, on $2.4 billion of revenues. In 2006, the company's full year net income was $36.3 million, or $2.19 per share, and total revenues were $1.5 billion. The fourth quarter net income was $23.5 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, and total revenues were $785 million. In the same three month period of 2006, the company reported net income of $13.8 million, or $0.76 per share, on revenues of $463 million.
MAUMEE, OHIO, FEBRUARY 6, 2008The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Grain & Ethanol Group's 2007 operating income of $65.9 million was more than double its previous income record of $28.0 million achieved in 2006. Total revenues were $1.5 billion for the year. This included $407 million of grain and ethanol sales made by the group in accordance with origination and marketing agreements between the company and its ethanol joint ventures, for which it receives a fee. The group's 2006 revenues were $791 million. Total revenues in the Grain & Ethanol Group have increased for both the quarter and year due to a considerable increase in both the volume and price of grain sold, and due to an increase in the gallons of ethanol sold. Income from the ethanol investments grew significantly during the year because of the three ethanol plants in operation or under development; the Albion, MI plant began production in August 2006, the Clymers, IN plant began production in April 2007 and the third plant in Greenville, OH is scheduled to begin production within the next week. The group's grain business also benefited from higher space and fee income. Additionally, income from the group's investment in Lansing Trade Group LLC was more than double the prior year. For the fourth quarter, the Grain & Ethanol Group's operating income was $30.1 million, in contrast to $12.3 million earned in the same three month period of 2006. Total revenues for the quarter were $548 million, including $144 million of grain and ethanol sales made by the group in accordance with origination and marketing agreements with the ethanol joint ventures, for which only a fee is received. In comparison, the group's fourth quarter revenues last year were $305 million.
The Rail Group's operating income for 2007 was $19.5 million, which is the same as 2006. Revenues of $130 million for the year were up from $113 million in the prior year. The group grew the rail fleet by more than 8 percent during 2007, and ended the year with more than 22,700 cars and locomotives. The group's average lease rates have remained stable. The average utilization rate (the percentage of the fleet's railcars in service) for 2007 was 92.6%, which was down from the 2006 average of 95.2%; however the year ended with a utilization rate of 93.4%. Including gains from railcar sales and related leases entered into during the year, gross profit in the group's leasing business was slightly higher than year earlier results. The railcar repair and manufacturing businesses experienced declines in gross profit during the year, but saw some improvement in the fourth quarter. The Rail Group generated $3.8 million in operating income in the fourth quarter of 2007 on $28 million of revenues. In 2006, operating income for the same three month period was $3.4 million and revenues amounted to $24 million.
In 2007, the Plant Nutrient Group exceeded income records ending the year with operating income of $27.1 million on $466 million of revenues. This compares to the prior year operating income of $3.3 million on revenues of $265 million. The 2007 income is more than double the group's prior record of $10.4 million, established in 2005. Total nutrient volume for the year increased by more than 40 percent; this was influenced by both an approximate 20 percent increase in corn acreage and market share growth. Margin improvement also contributed significantly to the improved bottom line. For the fourth quarter, the group's operating income was $8.7 million on $140 million of revenues. Last year its operating income was $1.3 million on revenues of $67 million for the same three month period. Sales volume remained high in the fourth quarter as a result of increased wheat acres and stepped up buying in the face of further escalation of nutrient prices and robust demand driven by anticipated strong corn acres in 2008.
The Turf & Specialty Group's full year operating income was $0.1 million on $104 million of revenues. In 2006, the group had operating income of $3.2 million, and total revenues were $111 million. The 2007 shortfall in the lawn business was attributable to reduced sales of insecticide and fungicide products, and the escalation of raw material costs. The cob business had lower earnings during 2007 mainly due to the need to outsource a portion of the cob from competitors, which resulted in a significantly higher cob cost for the year. The group incurred an operating loss of $0.8 million in the fourth quarter on $19 million of revenues. Last year, its operating income was $0.2 million for the same period, and revenues were $18 million.
Total sales for the Retail Group were $180 million in 2007, or 1.9 percent above the 2006 total of $177 million. Same store sales, however, were down approximately 1 percent. The group reported operating income of $0.1 million in 2007 after recording a $1.9 million impairment charge on certain retail assets. In the prior year, the group earned operating income of $3.2 million. The Retail Group's fourth quarter operating loss was $0.6 million on $50 million of revenues, which includes the impairment. Last year, operating income was $1.9 million, and total revenues were $49 million in the same three month period.
"To be reporting record breaking results for the fourth consecutive year is truly gratifying. Our Grain & Ethanol and Plant Nutrient groups achieved phenomenal income growth this year, and the Rail Group maintained solid performance despite some tightening in the rail industry," said President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson. Mr. Anderson added, "To see the results of our strategic growth initiatives is very satisfying. Our investments in the ethanol business and Lansing Trade Group, and continual expansion of the rail business are clearly paying dividends. It was also rewarding to watch the Plant Nutrient Group rebound from the tough market realities of 2006 and end 2007 with record earnings - what a difference a year can make. My thanks to all our employees whose hard work made our current year performance possible."
The company will host a webcast on Thursday, February 7, 2008 at 11:00 A.M. ET, to discuss its performance and full year outlook. This can be accessed under the heading "Investor Relations" on its website at .

"Discounted Value"
means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, 0.50% over the yield to maturity implied by (i) the yields reported as of 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, on the display designated as "Page PX1" (or such other display as may replace Page PX1) on Bloomberg Financial Markets for the most recently issued actively traded on the run U.S. Treasury securities having a maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date, or(ii) if such yields are not reported as of such time or the yields reported as of such time are not ascertainable (including by way of interpolation), the Treasury Constant Maturity Series Yields reported, for the latest day for which such yields have been so reported as of the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (or any comparable successor publication) for U.S. Treasury securities having a constant maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date.

"Remaining Average Life"
means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, all payments of such Called Principal and interest thereon that would be due after the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal if no payment of such Called Principal were made prior to its scheduled due date, that if such Settlement Date is not a date on which interest payments are due to be made under the terms of the Notes, then the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such Settlement Date and required to be paid on such Settlement Date pursuant to Sections 8.2, 8.7 or 8.8 or Section 12.1.

On reasonable request by the Company in connection with the delivery to any holder of a Note of information required to be delivered to such holder under this Agreement or requested by such holder (other than a holder that is a party to this Agreement or its nominee), such holder will enter into an agreement with the Company embodying the provisions of this Section 20.
In the event that as a condition to access information relating to the Company or the transactions contemplated by or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, any Purchaser is required to agree to a confidentiality undertaking (whether through Intralinks or any other electronic platform) which is different from the terms of this Section 20, the terms of this Section 20 shall supersede the terms of any such other confidentiality undertaking.

The Andersons, Inc. released a press release on May 7, 2008, reporting its first quarter 2008 earnings. This press release is attached as exhibit 99 to this filing.

, today announced first quarter net income of $7.8 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, on revenues of $713 million. In the same three month period of 2007, the company reported net income of $9.2 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, on $407 million of revenues.
MAUMEE, OHIO, MAY 7, 2008The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Grain & Ethanol Group's first quarter operating income of $2.2 million was significantly less than its year earlier result of $10.2 million. The prior year's first quarter had $4.1 million more in non-recurring development fees associated with the ethanol plants. The grain business suffered a significant basis loss during the quarter as the cash markets for corn, beans and wheat did not rise at the same pace as the futures market. In contrast, income from the ethanol joint ventures grew significantly during the most recent quarter. The Albion and Clymers ethanol plants were in operation during the entire quarter and the Greenville plant opened in February. This compares to last year, when only the Albion facility was operating during the first quarter. In addition, first quarter income from the group's investment in Lansing Trade Group was significantly higher this year. The group was also impacted during the first quarter by rising inventory carrying costs associated with higher grain prices; specifically, interest expense increased over $3.0 million in comparison to the prior period. Total first quarter revenues for the group were $499 million; this includes $186 million of grain and ethanol sales made by the group in accordance with origination and marketing agreements between the company and its ethanol joint ventures for which it receives a fee. In the first quarter of 2007, the group's total revenues were $244 million, and included $40 million of the aforementioned ethanol joint venture fee only sales. While revenues for the group are higher, such amounts do not serve as good predictors of income or economic performance in a commodity based business.
The Rail Group's record operating income of $6.4 million in the first quarter of 2008 was more than double the $3.0 million earned during the same three month period a year ago. Revenues of $35 million for the quarter were $9 million higher than the $26 million reported in 2007. The group recognized $2.2 million in gross margin from the sale of railcars and related leases during the quarter. Gross profit from the leasing business was higher due to lower maintenance costs per car, a higher utilization rate, and growth in the size of the fleet. The group now has approximately 23,200 cars and locomotives, which is 10% more than it had twelve months ago. The average utilization rate (the percentage of the fleet in service) for the quarter was 93.4% in comparison to 92.5% for the same period last year. The gross profit of the railcar repair business grew during the first quarter due to the addition of a new repair shop in the second half of 2007.
The Plant Nutrient Group achieved record operating income of $7.5 million during the first quarter of 2008 on revenues of $105 million. These earnings are unprecedented in the first quarter, as the first quarter is typically a break-even or loss period. In the same three month period in 2007, the group reported a $0.4 million operating profit on $67 million of revenues. These earnings resulted from significant margin increases primarily resulting from inventory price appreciation, which began last year and has continued into 2008. Due to this escalation of plant nutrient prices, sales volume is slightly down from last year. As was recently announced, the group purchased Douglass Fertilizer & Chemical Inc. at the end of April. With 2007 sales of $47 million, Douglass has five facilities in Florida and one in Puerto Rico and is a specialty liquid nutrient manufacturer and retailer/wholesaler whose product lines complement the group's existing product lines well.
The Turf & Specialty Group achieved operating income of $2.0 million on $40 million of revenues during the first quarter. Last year, the group reported $1.8 million of income on $36 million of revenues for the period. Turf products tonnage increased slightly from year to year. Gross profit per ton was also up slightly, in spite of record high raw material prices this year, due to a larger percentage of sales coming from proprietary products such as Contec DG.
The Retail Group reported revenues of $33.7 million for the first quarter of 2008, which is similar to the $33.8 million in revenues reported for the same period in 2007. This includes sales from the Sylvania market store, which opened in the second quarter of 2007. Same store sales decreased 4.9% for the period. This sales decline is believed to be due to the overall decline in consumer spending. For the three month period, the Retail Group incurred an operating loss of $3.4 million, which compares to a $2.3 million loss incurred in the first quarter of 2007. Due to competitive sales pressure in the markets served, margins have also been reduced.
"We feel good about our overall performance so far this year. The Plant Nutrient and Rail businesses both contributed significantly to our income during the period. Our Grain & Ethanol Group was impacted in the first quarter by a reduction in basis that has started to return in April. We anticipate regaining the majority of this back later in the year, since we expect basis levels to improve. We were pleased this quarter that we were able to adjust both our long and short term debt to respond to the increasing commodity prices," said President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson. "We are excited about the recent addition of Douglass Fertilizer, as this acquisition is consistent with our strategic goal of increasing our plant nutrient footprint and national market share through geographic expansion. We are also pleased that the third ethanol plant and sixth rail repair shop became operational this year. Our team continues to demonstrate the company's commitment to organic and adjacent growth," added Mr. Anderson.
Mr. Anderson also stated "Looking at our 2008 earnings forecast, numerous factors will have a bearing on the full year outcome; weather patterns during the agricultural planting and growing season within our region, the ability of farmers to make progress on corn planting that is currently quite a bit behind the five year national average, nutrient and energy prices, timing of railcar sales, and the performance of our equity investments, which include the ethanol production plants and Lansing Trade Group. Given all of these variables and the picture we see before us today, we anticipate that our full year 2008 earnings will be within a range of $3.65 to $4.00 per diluted share."
The company will host a webcast on Thursday, May 8, 2008 at 11:00 A.M. ET, to discuss its performance and full year outlook. This can be accessed under the heading "Investor Relations" on its website at .

, today announced record second quarter net income of $45.6 million, or $2.48 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.1 billion. In the same three month period in 2007, the company reported net income of $25.5 million, or $1.40 per diluted share, on $634 million of revenues. For the first six months of 2008, the company's net income was $53.4 million, or $2.91 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.8 billion. In the first half of 2007, The Andersons earned $34.7 million, or $1.90 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.0 billion.
MAUMEE, OHIO, AUGUST 6, 2008The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Grain & Ethanol Group's record operating income of $20.0 million in the second quarter was significantly more than its year earlier result of $12.0 million. The grain business benefited from significantly improved margins on grain sales and the more than doubling of service fee income. The business, however, continues to be impacted by rising costs associated with higher grain prices. Specifically, interest expense increased more than $5.6 million in comparison to the prior period, and contract fair value adjustments were increased due to the increased risk of contract default associated with rising grain prices. Income from the ethanol joint ventures also grew during the most recent quarter. Second quarter income from the group's investment in Lansing Trade Group was $5.1 million higher this year. Total second quarter revenues for the group were $696 million; this compares to total revenues of $324 million for the same period last year. While revenues for the group are higher, such amounts do not serve as good predictors of income or economic performance in a commodity based business. The Grain & Ethanol Group's operating income through the first six months was $22.2 million in both 2008 and 2007. Total revenues through June 2008 and 2007 were $1.2 billion and $568 million, respectively.
The Rail Group's operating income was $4.9 million in the second quarter on revenues of $43 million. Last year, the group reported $6.9 million of income and $42 million of revenues for the same three month period. The group recognized $1.1 million in gross margin from the sale of railcars and related leases during the quarter, however, in the second quarter last year it recognized gains of $4.1 million for similar sales. Gross profit from the leasing business was higher due to a higher utilization rate and growth in the size of the fleet. The group now has 23,840 cars and locomotives, which is 5 percent more than it had 12 months ago. The average utilization rate (the percentage of the fleet in service) for the quarter was 93.2 percent in comparison to 92.0 percent for the same period last year. The gross profit of the railcar repair business grew slightly during the second quarter due to the addition of a new repair shop in the second half of 2007. The group's first half operating income this year was $11.3 million on $78 million of revenues. In 2007, operating income through June was $9.9 million and revenues were $68 million. Included in these results were gains on sales of railcars and related leases of $3.3 million and $5.0 million, respectively.
The Plant Nutrient Group achieved record operating income of $47.4 million during the second quarter of 2008 on revenues of $274 million. With these results, the group has had quarter income records for six consecutive quarters. The group reported a $17.1 million operating profit on $183 million of revenues in the second quarter of 2007. These exceptional earnings resulted from significant margin increases primarily resulting from inventory value appreciation stemming from its significant storage space and unprecedented escalation in basic nutrient prices. This escalation of plant nutrient prices, lower corn acres, and pre-season buying at the end of 2007 has led to a reduced sales volume when compared to last year. The group's first half operating income this year was $54.9 million on $379 million of revenues. Last year, its operating income through the first six months was $17.5 million on revenues of $249 million The purchase of Douglass Fertilizer & Chemical Inc. that was completed last quarter has proven to be accretive to earnings, as expected. Yesterday, the group announced the purchase of three pelleted lime facilities in Ohio, Illinois and Nebraska. The acquisition allows the group to expand its value added product offering and further broaden its geographic territory.
The Turf & Specialty Group had operating income of $1.9 million in the second quarter this year on $36 million of revenues. Last year, the group reported $0.7 million of income on $30 million of revenues for the period. Turf products tonnage increased slightly from year to year, and gross profit per ton increased considerably, in spite of record high raw material prices this year, due to a larger percentage of sales coming from proprietary products such as Contec DG. Through the first half of 2008, the group's operating income was $3.9 million on $76 million of revenues. Last year, its operating income was $2.5 million for the same period, and revenues were $67 million. The group, along with several partners, was recently awarded a $5.0 million grant by the state of Ohio for research and development expenses; this will be utilized to further develop technologically advanced and proprietary products.
The Retail Group reported revenues of $53 million for the second quarter of 2008, which is slightly below the $55 million in revenues reported for the same period in 2007. This sales decline is due to the overall decline in consumer spending. For the three month period, the group earned operating income of $3.4 million. In the comparable period last year, the group's operating income was $3.6 million. Through six months the group has broken even on $86 million of revenues. Last year, operating income through June was $1.3 million and total revenues were $89 million. Margins have been reduced due to competitive sales pressure.
"Our second quarter and first half results are outstanding," said President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson. "Both our Plant Nutrient and Grain & Ethanol Groups contributed significantly to our income during the period. I want to extend special thanks to our Plant Nutrient Group team. The team has worked tirelessly to serve customers and optimize their inventory position, while simultaneously exploring multiple growth opportunities and integrating Douglass Fertilizer into their business. It was truly a team effort and to see their results is rewarding. We are also excited by the addition of the three pelleted lime facilities yesterday, as this acquisition, like Douglass Fertilizer, is consistent with our strategic goal of growing our business to a national footprint"
"Last week we revised our full year guidance to $5.00  $5.40 per diluted share," Mr. Anderson continued. "Our guidance was heavily influenced by the reported and expected performance of our Plant Nutrient Group. Numerous factors, however, will have a bearing on the full year outcome; basic nutrient prices, grain prices, timing of railcar sales, and the performance of our equity investments, which include the significant contributions of Lansing Trade Group and the ethanol production facilities."
The company will host a webcast on Thursday, August 7, 2008 at 11:00 A.M. ET, to discuss its performance and full year outlook. This can be accessed under the heading "Investor" on its website at .

, today announced third quarter net income of $12.8 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, on revenues of $906 million. In the same three month period in 2007, the company reported net income of $10.6 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, on $554 million of revenues. For the first nine months of 2008, the company's net income was $66.3 million, or $3.60 per diluted share, on revenues of $2.7 billion. In the first nine months of 2007, The Andersons earned $45.3 million, or $2.48 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.6 billion.
MAUMEE, OHIO, NOVEMBER 4, 2008The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Grain & Ethanol Group's operating income was $9.4 million in the third quarter, which was below its year earlier result of $13.7 million. The grain business benefited from significantly improved basis income, with the company recovering most of the basis losses incurred earlier in the year. Income from the ethanol business declined $8.8 million during the most recent quarter to a loss of $2.0 million due primarily to the combined performance of the company's investments in three ethanol limited liability companies. Third quarter income from the group's investment in Lansing Trade Group was $2.6 million, which is $1.0 million lower than last year. Total third quarter revenues for the group were $651 million; this compares to total revenues of $383 million for the same period last year. While revenues for the group are higher, such amounts do not serve as good predictors of income or economic performance in a commodity based business. During the quarter, the group purchased a grain storage facility, and leased two others. This increased the company's storage capacity by 7.6 million bushels. The Grain & Ethanol Group's operating income through the first nine months was $31.7 million in 2008. In 2007, operating income through September was $35.9 million. Total revenues through September 2008 and 2007 were $1.8 billion and $950 million, respectively.
The Rail Group's operating income was $5.2 million in the third quarter on revenues of $28 million. Last year, the group reported $5.8 million of income and $34 million of revenues for the same three month period. The group recognized $0.7 million in gross margin from the sale of railcars and related leases during the quarter, which is $2.1 million less than similar sales for the same period last year. Gross profit from the leasing business was higher due to wider relet spreads, a higher utilization rate, and growth in the size of the fleet. The fleet has increased 6 percent to 24,007 cars and locomotives. The average utilization rate (the percentage of the fleet in service) for the quarter was 93.2 percent in comparison to 92.5 percent for the same period last year. The gross profit of the railcar repair and manufacturing businesses also grew during the third quarter. The group's first nine months operating income this year was $16.5 million on $106 million of revenues. In 2007, operating income through September was $15.7 million and revenues were $102 million. Included in these results were gains on sales of railcars and related leases of $4.0 million and $7.9 million, for 2008 and 2007, respectively. A seventh railcar repair shop was opened in Ogden, Utah in September, and the group continues to explore additional railcar repair shop opportunities.
The Plant Nutrient Group had a record operating income of $7.2 million during the third quarter of 2008 on revenues of $162 million. The group reported an $0.8 million operating profit on $77 million of revenues in the third quarter of 2007. The current quarter earnings were impacted both positively and negatively by fluctuating fertilizer prices. During the quarter significant margin increases were recognized on sales made due to the inventory appreciation that occurred as a result of rising prices. Certain inventory values, however, declined sharply late in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter resulting in $13.1 million in adjustments due to adverse purchase commitments and lower of cost or market adjustments. Sales volume during the quarter was slightly above the prior year. The group's operating income through September this year was $62.1 million on $541 million of revenues. Last year, its operating income through the first nine months was $18.4 million on revenues of $326 million.
The Turf & Specialty Group had an operating loss of $0.5 million in the third quarter this year on $23 million of revenues. Last year, the group reported a loss of $1.6 million on $18 million of revenues. Turf products tonnage increased slightly from year to year, and gross profit per ton increased considerably, due to a larger percentage of sales coming from proprietary products such as Contec DG. The group continues to see proprietary products as a growth area. Through the first nine months of 2008, the group's operating income was $3.4 million on $99 million of revenues. Last year, its operating income was $0.9 million for the same period, and revenues were $85 million.
The Retail Group reported revenues of $41 million for the third quarter of 2008, which is slightly below the $42 million in revenues reported for the same period in 2007. This sales decline is due to the overall decline in consumer spending. For the three month period, the group's operating loss was $0.2 million, which is an improvement over the $0.6 million operating loss in the prior year. Through nine months the group has lost $0.2 million on $127 million of revenues. Last year, the operating income through September was $0.8 million and total revenues were $131 million. Margins improved during the third quarter, which has led to year to date margins being consistent with the prior year.
Total company interest expense for the quarter and year to date are $3.3 million and $11.8 million higher than the prior year, respectively.
"Our third quarter and nine month results are both records, however, we were disappointed by the sudden turn of events in the fertilizer markets," said President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson. "The Plant Nutrient Group contributed significantly to our income during the period, however, our expectations for the group were even higher before the recent sharp decline in global fertilizer prices that led to material inventory adjustment."
"Our current guidance is $3.50  $4.00 per diluted share," Mr. Anderson continued. "As we noted in the second quarter press release our former guidance was heavily influenced by the reported and expected performance of our Plant Nutrient Group. This is again true of our current guidance, which is primarily attributed to the aforementioned decline in global fertilizer prices. The current guidance is also partially attributable to the economics in the ethanol industry. Numerous other factors will also have a bearing on the full year outcome, such as; grain prices, timing of railcar sales, and the performance of our equity investments, which include Lansing Trade Group and the ethanol production facilities."
The company will host a webcast on Wednesday, November 5, 2008 at 11:00 A.M. ET, to discuss its performance and full year outlook. This can be accessed under the heading "Investor" on its website at .

1.
PHILOSOPHY AND PURPOSE
The Andersons, Inc., (the "Company") wishes to recognize the value of past and future services contributed by members of Company Staff and other key employees (the "Participant"), and recognizes that if a Change In Control occurred, the resulting uncertainty regarding the consequences of such event could adversely affect the Company's ability to attract, retain and motivate its key talent. In addition to change in control situations, the Company recognizes the difficulty its key employees would have in obtaining comparable employment if their employment were involuntarily terminated. The Company believes that the existence of this Policy will serve as an incentive to its key talent to remain in the employ of the Company and would assure the key talent's objectivity in evaluating a potential Change In Control and advising as to whether it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. In consideration of the protection and other benefits that the Company is providing under this Policy, the Company further requires the Participant to make certain important commitments to the Company.

NEWS RELEASE
Phone: 419-891-6417
E-mail:
garysmith@andersonsinc.com
, today announced full year net income of $32.9 million, or $1.79 per diluted share, on $3.5 billion of revenues. In 2007, the company's full year net income was $68.8 million, or $3.75 per diluted share, and total revenues were $2.4 billion. These prior year results included $7.7 million in net after-tax one time gains, or $0.42 per diluted share. The full year results were heavily influenced by significant pre-tax inventory and contract adjustments of $97.2 million within the Plant Nutrient Group. The fourth quarter loss was $33.4 million, or $1.85 per diluted share, and total revenues were $770 million. In the same three month period of 2007, the company reported record net income of $23.5 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, on revenues of $785 million. The company will continue to monitor the fertilizer markets and could further adjust the value of its year end inventory if significant price appreciation or depreciation occurs prior to the company's 10K filing at the end of February. Recent fertilizer market prices have stabilized, and it is believed that the company has accounted for the majority, and possibly all, of the inventory adjustments.
MAUMEE, OHIO, FEBRUARY 5, 2009The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
"Although our full year earnings could be viewed as respectable versus history, since they are our third best historical performance, this is overshadowed by the fact that I am deeply disappointed in our fourth quarter results - we could have done better," said President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson. "The decline in our results was largely a result of inventory and contract adjustments within our Plant Nutrient Group. I want our shareholders to know that we are taking a hard look at the risk management processes in that group and fully intend to make improvements that we believe will reduce the likelihood of similar events in the future."
The Grain & Ethanol Group's 2008 operating income was $43.6 million on revenues of $2.4 billion. This compares to the income record set in 2007 of $65.9 million on revenues of $1.5 billion. This year's revenues included $866 million of grain and ethanol sales made by the group in accordance with origination and marketing agreements between the company and its ethanol joint ventures, for which it receives a fee. Total revenues for the group have increased this year due to a considerable increase in both the volume and price of grain sold, and to an increase in the gallons of ethanol sold. The group's grain business benefited from higher gross profit on grain sales, and higher space and fee income; however, these were offset by higher expenses, primarily interest and bad debt reserves. Income from the ethanol business declined $14.5 million in 2008, due to the combined performance of the company's equity investments in three ethanol limited liability companies and a $4.1 million reduction in development fee income. The majority of the ethanol business differential occurred in the second half of the year. Full year income from the group's investment in Lansing Trade Group was $6.5 million lower than 2007, due to the company's $5.5 million share of Lansing Trade Group's fourth quarter loss. At the end of the third quarter, the income from this investment was well ahead of the prior year; however, during the fourth quarter Lansing Trade Group recorded significant reserves due to several counterparty exposures that took their otherwise profitable quarter to a loss. Lansing Trade Group is adequately reserved for these items as of the end of the year. For the fourth quarter, the Grain & Ethanol Group's operating income was $11.9 million, in contrast to $30.1 million earned in the same three month period last year. This fourth quarter decrease was due to the aforementioned income decreases in the ethanol business and Lansing Trade Group, which were then partially offset by considerable space income in the grain business. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $565 million; in comparison, the group's revenues for the same period last year were $548 million.
The Rail Group's operating income for 2008 was $19.8 million, which is up slightly from the $19.5 million earned in 2007. The quality of earnings during 2008 improved significantly as gains from railcar sales were down $4.1 million this year. Revenues of $134 million for the year were up from $130 million in the prior year. The group grew the rail fleet by 5 percent during 2008, including the addition of 43 locomotives and ended the year with approximately 23,800 cars and locomotives. The group's average lease rates are slightly lower. The average utilization rate (the percentage of the fleet's railcars in service) for 2008 was 92.7 percent, which was up just slightly from the prior year. Due to reduced rail traffic, however, utilization rates for the fourth quarter decreased to 91.1 percent. Gross profit from the leasing business was higher due to wider relet spreads and growth in the size of the fleet. Additionally, both the railcar repair and manufacturing businesses experienced significant increases in gross profit during the year. The Rail Group generated $3.3 million in operating income in the fourth quarter on $28 million of revenues. In 2007, operating income for the same three month period was $3.8 million on similar revenues.
The Plant Nutrient Group ended the year with an operating loss of $12.3 million. This loss resulted from $97.2 million of lower of cost or market adjustments made to reduce inventory values to the current market value and recognize losses on purchase commitments caused by sharp declines in the fertilizer market. In 2007, the group had an operating income of $27.1 million. Revenues for 2008 and 2007 were $653 million and $466 million, respectively. Revenues were up significantly this year due to increased pricing in the fertilizer market, even though volume for the year was actually down close to 20 percent. Prior to the fourth quarter, volumes for the year were only slightly behind the prior year; however, volume during the fourth quarter dropped by 50 percent. For the fourth quarter, the group's operating loss was $74.5 million on $112 million of revenues. The quarter was impacted by the aforementioned volume decrease and significant inventory adjustments of $84.1 million. Last year the group's operating fourth quarter income was $8.7 million on revenues of $140 million.
The Turf & Specialty Group's full year operating income was $2.3 million on $119 million of revenues. In 2007, the group had operating income of $0.1 million, and total revenues were $104 million. The 2008 results are attributable to the group's successful focus on value added proprietary products, such as Contec DG, which is a growth area for the group. Turf products tonnage increased slightly from year to year, however, gross profit per ton increased considerably. The cob business earnings this year were higher than in 2007, despite a corn cob inventory fire at the Delphi facility at the end of the year that led to increased expenses. The group incurred an operating loss of $1.1 million in the fourth quarter on $20 million of revenues. Last year, its operating loss was $0.8 million for the same period, and revenues were $19 million.
Total sales for the Retail Group were $173 million in 2008, or 4 percent below the 2007 total of $180 million. The group reported operating income of $0.8 million this year. In 2007, the group reported operating income of $0.1 million, which included a $1.9 million impairment charge on certain retail assets. The group continues to be impacted by the weakness in the overall economy and resulting reduced consumer spending. The Retail Group's fourth quarter operating profit was $1.0 million on $46 million of revenues. Last year, which includes the impairment, the operating loss was $0.6 million, and total revenues were $50 million in the same three month period.
"Clearly our full year earnings were heavily influenced by the results within our Plant Nutrient Group," Mr. Anderson stated. "The reduced earnings were also partially attributable to the economics in the ethanol industry and reduced income from our investment in Lansing Trade Group," Mr. Anderson added. "On a positive note, both our Grain Division and Rail Group had great years. Also, our propriety product strategy within the Turf & Specialty Group is proving to be successful. In addition, we made wise and timely decisions early in the year to improve the capital structure and liquidity of the Company."
The company will host a webcast on Friday, February 6, 2009 at 11:00 A.M. ET, to discuss its performance. This can be accessed under the heading "Investor" on its website at .

, today announced second quarter net income attributable to the company of $15.9 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, on revenues of $811 million. In the same three month period of 2008, the company reported record results of $45.6 million, or $2.48 per diluted share, on $1.1 billion of revenues. For the first six months of 2009, the company earned $20.9 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.5 billion. In the first half of 2008, The Andersons reported record results of $53.4 million, or $2.90 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.8 billion. It should be noted that the earnings from the prior year included unprecedented margins in our Plant Nutrient Group that accounted for nearly two-thirds of the income.
MAUMEE, OHIO, August 5, 2009The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Grain & Ethanol Group's operating income of $8.9 million in the second quarter was significantly less than its year earlier result of $20.0 million. The grain business had its third best second quarter as it benefited from good space income. The ethanol business was profitable during the second quarter of 2009. When compared to the prior year; however, income from the ethanol business was down considerably in the second quarter as last year the business benefited from margins being locked in before the ethanol industry decline. Second quarter 2009 income from the group's investment in Lansing Trade Group was also significantly lower than last year, primarily due to declines in its trading business. Total second quarter revenues for the group were $500 million; this includes $188 million of grain and ethanol sales made by the group in accordance with origination and marketing agreements between the company and its ethanol joint ventures. In the second quarter of 2008, the group's total revenues were $696 million and included $226 million of the aforementioned sales. While revenues for the group are lower, due to substantially lower commodity prices, such amounts do not serve as good predictors of income or economic performance in a commodity based business. The Grain & Ethanol Group's operating income through the first six months was $14.7 million in 2009 and $22.2 million in 2008. Total revenues through June 2009 and 2008 were $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.
The Rail Group's operating income was $0.6 million in the second quarter of 2009, which is down significantly from the $4.9 million earned during the same three month period a year ago. The group continues to be impacted by the double digit declines in rail traffic. The group recognized $0.8 million in gross margin from the sale of railcars and related leases during the quarter, whereas last year $1.1 million was recognized. Gross profit from the leasing business was significantly less due to lower utilization rates, the corresponding increase in storage expense from idle assets, increased maintenance expense per car, and decreased leasing rates. The group now has approximately 23,800 cars and locomotives. The average utilization rate (the percentage of the fleet in service) for the quarter was 80.6 percent in comparison to 93.3 percent for the same period last year. The gross profit of both the railcar repair and manufacturing businesses declined considerably this quarter due to reduced activity resulting from the overall economic decline. Revenues of $24 million for the second quarter were down significantly from the $43 million reported in 2008, due mainly to a $14 million reduction in car sales. The group's first half operating income this year was $1.5 million on $51 million of revenues. In 2008, operating income through June was $11.3 million and revenues were $78 million. These results included gains on sales of railcars and related leases of $1.1 million and $3.3 million, respectively.
The Plant Nutrient Group had an operating income of $10.3 million during the second quarter of 2009, on revenues of $198 million. In the same three month period of 2008, the group achieved record operating income of $47.4 million, on revenues of $274 million. Margins were down significantly from the prior year. Margins were significantly lower as basic nutrient prices deflated in 2009, whereas in 2008 margins greatly increased as nutrient prices inflated. Retailers reducing their nutrient inventory holdings, and lower application rates of basic nutrients (potash, potassium and to a lesser degree nitrogen), led to reduced sales volume this quarter. The group's first half operating income this year was $12.4 million on $309 million of revenues. Last year, its operating income through the first six months was a record $54.9 million on revenues of $379 million. The group acquired Hartung Brothers Inc's. Fertilizer Division (HBI) on August 1st. HBI is a regional wholesale supplier of liquid fertilizers with five locations in Wisconsin and one in southeastern Minnesota. This acquisition will allow the group to expand its value added product offering, grow its wholesale customer base, and broaden its geographic territory.
The Turf & Specialty Group had a record operating income of $3.0 million in the second quarter this year on $40 million of revenues. Last year, the group reported $1.9 million of income on $36 million of revenues for the period. Turf products tonnage increased by over 20 percent year to year, but gross profit per ton decreased due to a product mix that included a higher percentage of consumer and industrial products. Through the first half of 2009, the group's operating income was a record $6.1 million on $84 million of revenues. Last year, its operating income was $3.9 million for the same period, and revenues were $76 million. The group continues to experience positive results from its focus on proprietary products and expanded product lines.
The Retail Group reported revenues of $49 million for the second quarter of 2009, which is below the $53 million in revenues reported for the same period in 2008. The group earned operating income of $2.9 million in the second quarter of 2009. In the comparable period last year, the group's operating income was $3.4 million. Through six months, the group earned $0.2 million and total revenues were $83 million. Last year through June the group broke even on total revenues of $86 million. Both the group's margins and customer counts have improved slightly; however, this was offset by a decline in the average sale per customer.
"Although we would have liked better results this quarter, it is important to remember that last year's second quarter results included unprecedented margins in our Plant Nutrient Group. We are pleased with the results of our grain and ethanol businesses. The grain business performance was strong, and our ethanol business returned to profitability, which is an accomplishment in the current ethanol environment. Conversely, we continue to be disappointed with the Lansing Trade Group results this year. The Plant Nutrient Group has returned to solid financial performance, and we believe the lower of cost or market issues are behind us. The Turf & Specialty Group set an earning's record as the value added and proprietary product strategy being pursued continues to be successful. Our Rail Group, and to a lesser extent our Retail Group, however, continue to be impacted by the overall economic decline," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson. "These results continue to demonstrate that our purposeful diversification allows us to remain a strong and profitable company, even when some businesses are underperforming."
The company will host a webcast on Thursday, August 6, 2009 at 11:00 A.M. ET, to discuss its performance. This can be accessed under the heading "Investor" on its website at .

today announced third quarter net income attributable to the company of $1.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, on revenues of $601 million. In the third quarter of 2008, the company reported results of $12.8 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, on revenues of $906 million. For the first nine months of 2009, the company earned $22.1 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, on revenues of $2.1 billion. In the same period of 2008, The Andersons reported results of $66.3 million, or $3.59 per diluted share, on $2.7 billion of revenues. Prior year earnings included unprecedented margins in our Plant Nutrient Group, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of the income for the same period, but which were not sustainable for all of 2008.
MAUMEE, OHIO, November 4, 2009The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Grain & Ethanol Group's operating income of $8.9 million in the third quarter was comparable to its year earlier result of $9.4 million. The grain business income was down significantly in comparison to the prior year as space income and margin on grain sales returned to more traditional levels. In addition, bad debt reserves were increased. During the third quarter the ethanol business benefited from greatly improved margins and from the finalization of The Andersons Albion Ethanol LLC business interruption claim. Third quarter 2009 income from the group's investment in Lansing Trade Group was down slightly from the prior year. Total third quarter revenues for the Grain & Ethanol Group were $451 million; this includes $176 million of grain and ethanol sales made in accordance with origination and marketing agreements between the company and its ethanol joint ventures. In the third quarter of 2008, the group's total revenues were $651 million and included $232 million of the previously mentioned sales. While revenues for the group are lower, due to substantially lower commodity prices, such amounts do not serve as good indicators of income or economic performance in a commodity based business. The Grain & Ethanol Group's operating income through the first nine months was $23.5 million in 2009 and $31.7 million in 2008. Income through September for the grain division in comparison to the prior year is up considerably. Conversely, year to date income for both the ethanol division and Lansing Trade Group is down significantly. Total revenues through September 2009 and 2008 were $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively.
The Rail Group had an operating loss of $1.1 million in the third quarter of 2009, which is down significantly from the $5.2 million earned during the same three month period a year ago. The group continues to be impacted by the double digit declines in rail traffic. Gross profit from the leasing business was significantly less due mainly to lower utilization rates and the corresponding increase in storage expense from idle assets. The group now has approximately 24,000 cars and locomotives. The average utilization rate (the percentage of the fleet in service) for the quarter was 74.4 percent in comparison to 93.3 percent for the same period last year. The gross profit of both the railcar repair and manufacturing businesses continued to be down significantly this quarter due to reduced activity resulting from overall economic conditions. Revenues of $21 million for the third quarter were down from the $28 million reported in 2008. The group's first nine month's operating income this year was $0.4 million on $72 million of revenues. In 2008, operating income through September was $16.5 million and revenues were $106 million. These year to date results included gains on sales of railcars and related leases of $1.6 million and $4.0 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively.
The Plant Nutrient Group had an operating loss of $2.8 million during the third quarter of 2009 on revenues of $70 million. In the same three month period of 2008, the group achieved operating income of $7.2 million on revenues of $162 million. Margins were down significantly from the prior year, as third quarter 2008 benefited from unprecedented inventory appreciation, whereas third quarter 2009 margins returned to normal levels. Retailers continue to maintain lower inventory holdings that led to reduced sales volume during the third quarter in comparison to the prior year. The group's first nine month's operating income this year was $9.6 million on $380 million of revenues. Last year, its operating income through the first nine months was a record $62.1 million on revenues of $541 million, as the group benefited from unprecedented earnings from inventory appreciation, before the significant decline in inventory values, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008. The integration of the Hartung Brothers Inc's. Fertilizer Division, which was acquired on August 1, is proceeding well. This acquisition is allowing the group to expand its value added product offering, grow its wholesale customer base, and broaden its geographic territory.
The Turf & Specialty Group had an operating loss of $0.3 million in the third quarter this year on $21 million of revenues. Last year, the group reported a $0.5 million loss on $23 million of revenues for the period. Turf products tonnage increased year to year, but gross profit per ton decreased due primarily to product mix. Through the first nine months of 2009, the group's operating income was a record $5.8 million on $106 million of revenues. Last year, its operating income was $3.4 million for the same period, and revenues were $99 million. The group continues to experience positive results from its focus on proprietary products and expanded product lines; however, there has been some softness in the professional product market lately.
The Retail Group had an operating loss of $2.3 million in the third quarter of 2009; this was partially due to the recording of costs associated with the upcoming closing of the Lima store. In the comparable period last year, the group's operating loss was $0.2 million. The group reported revenues of $37 million for the third quarter of 2009, which is below the $41 million in revenues reported for the same period in 2008. Through nine months, the group recorded a loss of $2.1 million and total revenues of $120 million. Last year through September the group lost $0.2 million on total revenues of $127 million. The group continues to be impacted by the overall economic down turn, which has resulted in a decline of both customer counts and average sale per customer. Margins, however, have remained consistent with the prior year.
"We are disappointed overall with this quarter's results, which we would characterize as a mix of areas of continued concern, and some positive developments," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson. "Most significantly, our Rail Group continued to be seriously impacted by the overall weak economy. To a lesser extent our Retail Group was also impacted by the economic decline. Conversely, while our Grain & Ethanol Group's results for the quarter were lower than that of the prior year it was nice to see decent margins return to the ethanol business and Lansing Trade Group return to profitability. Within the grain business, while our quarterly results were well below the prior year, our year to date result is a record, which reflects our solid position in the grain business. And, the current ethanol trading environment, which allowed the third quarter results for the ethanol business to be markedly improved over recent quarters, has allowed us to lock in profitable margins for a significant portion of the fourth quarter sales and for some of the sales during the first half of 2010. Both our Plant Nutrient and Turf & Specialty groups had losses for the quarter, which is a typical third quarter result for these seasonal businesses, and for Plant Nutrient, a return to normal patterns following an extraordinary 2008. Finally, we recognized a one-time $4.1 million gain arising from the freezing of the Company's defined benefit pension plan effective July 1, 2010."
The company will host a webcast on Thursday, November 5, 2009 at 11:00 A.M. ET, to discuss its performance. This can be accessed under the heading "Investor" on its website at .

NEWS RELEASE
Phone: 419-891-6415
E-mail: nickconrad@andersonsinc.com
, today announced fourth quarter earnings of $16.2 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, and total revenues of $916 million. In the same three month period of 2008, the company reported a loss of $33.4 million, or $1.84 per diluted share, on revenues of $770 million. The prior year fourth quarter loss resulted from the recording of significant inventory adjustments within the Plant Nutrient Group. The 2009 net income attributable to the company was $38.4 million, or $2.08 per diluted share, on $3.0 billion of revenues. In the prior year, the company's full year earning's were $32.9 million, or $1.79 per diluted share, and total revenues were $3.5 billion.
MAUMEE, OHIO, FEBRUARY 8, 2010The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Grain & Ethanol Group's 2009 operating income was $51.4 million. This compares to an operating income of $43.6 million in 2008. The group's grain business had a record year, while the ethanol business had its second highest year resulting from significantly increased margins during the second half of the year. Full year income from the investment in Lansing Trade Group was lower than 2008, as a good fourth quarter was not enough to offset a modest loss incurred in the first half of the year. Total 2009 revenues for the Grain & Ethanol Group were $2.2 billion; this includes $806 million of grain and ethanol sales made in accordance with origination and marketing agreements between the company and its ethanol joint ventures. In 2008, the group's total revenues were $2.4 billion and included $866 million of the previously mentioned sales. For the fourth quarter, the Grain & Ethanol Group's operating income was $27.8 million, in contrast to $11.9 million earned during the same period in 2008. This fourth quarter increase in operating income was due to markedly improved results in the ethanol business and Lansing Trade Group. The ethanol business had its highest quarter since entering the business four years ago. These improvements were partially offset by lower quarterly results in the grain business due primarily to the late harvest in 2009. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $722 million; in comparison, the group's revenues for the same period last year were $565 million.
The Rail Group had an operating loss of $1.0 million in 2009, which is down significantly from the $19.8 million earned in 2008. The group continues to be impacted by the double digit declines in national rail traffic. Gross profit from the leasing business was significantly lower than the prior year due mainly to lower utilization rates and the corresponding increase in storage expense from idle cars. The average utilization rate (the percentage of the fleet's railcars in service) for 2009 was 78.1 percent, which was down significantly from the prior year rate of 92.5 percent. The group ended the year with a utilization rate of 70.5 percent. The full year results include gains on sales of railcars and related leases of $1.7 million in 2009, and $4.0 million in 2008. Additionally, both the railcar repair and manufacturing businesses experienced significant decreases in gross profit during the year, as sales were down more than 30 percent. The rail fleet ended the year with approximately 23,800 cars and locomotives, which is comparable to the 2008 year end total. Revenues of $93 million for 2009 were down considerably from the $134 million reported in the prior year. The Rail Group had an operating loss of $1.5 million in the fourth quarter on $21 million of revenues. In 2008, operating income for the same three month period was $3.3 million on revenues of $28 million.
The Plant Nutrient Group ended the year with operating income of $11.3 million. In 2008, the group had an operating loss of $12.3 million due to significant lower of cost or market adjustments caused by sharp declines in nutrient prices. Revenues for 2009 and 2008 were $491 million and $653 million, respectively. Revenues declined in 2009 due to a significant decrease in the average selling price, offset by a modest volume increase. For the fourth quarter, the group's operating income was $1.7 million on $111 million of revenues. Last year the group had an operating loss of $74.5 million during the fourth quarter on revenues of $112 million, due to $84.1 million of the aforementioned adjustments being made during the quarter. The integration of the Hartung Brothers Inc's. Fertilizer Division, which was acquired on August 1, 2009, was successfully completed by year end.
The Turf & Specialty Group's full year operating income was a record $4.7 million on $125 million of revenues. In 2008, the group had operating income of $2.3 million, and total revenues were $119 million. The 2009 results are mainly attributable to the group's lawn volume increasing by almost 20 percent. The group's focus on proprietary products in its lawn business is continuing to show positive results, even though there has been some softness in the professional product market. The group incurred an operating loss of $1.1 million in the fourth quarter on $19 million of revenues. Last year, its operating loss for the same period was also $1.1 million, on revenues of $20 million.
The Retail Group had an operating loss of $2.8 million in 2009. In the prior year, the group's operating income was $0.8 million. Total sales for the group were $162 million in 2009, or 6 percent below the 2008 total of $173 million. The group continues to be impacted by the weakness in the overall economy and resulting reduced consumer spending. Margins, however, have remained consistent with the prior year. The Retail Group's fourth quarter operating loss was $0.7 million on $42 million of revenues. Last year, during the same three month period, the operating income was $1.0 million, and total revenues were $46 million.
"Clearly, our full year earnings were heavily influenced by the results within our agricultural business units," CEO Mike Anderson stated. "The record full year earnings in our grain business, reflects our solid position in this industry. The significant turn around in ethanol margins enabled our ethanol business to report its best ever quarterly results. Our Turf & Specialty Group had a record year. Our Plant Nutrient Group returned to profitability, following the extraordinary loss incurred in 2008," Mr. Anderson added. "Our 2009 Rail and Retail Group results, however, were negatively impacted by the weak economy. Economic conditions such as these confirm that our strategy of purposeful diversification allows us to remain a strong company, even when external factors are significantly impacting one or more of our groups."
The company will host a webcast on Tuesday, February 9, 2010 at 11:00 A.M. ET, to discuss its performance. This can be accessed under the heading "Investor" on its website at .

Whereas
, it is a condition precedent to the obligations of the Noteholders under the Note Agreement that each Guarantor execute and deliver to the Noteholders a Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement in the form hereof, and each Guarantor wishes to fulfill said condition precedent;
Whereas
, in order to induce the Noteholders to execute and deliver the Note Agreement and certain of the Noteholders to enter into the Exchange and to make the financial accommodations as provided for in the Note Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
Now, Therefore
Each Guarantor unconditionally guarantees, jointly with the other Guarantors and severally, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, (i) the due and punctual payment of all obligations of the Company to the Noteholders under the Note Agreement and the Notes, including, without limitation, (A) the principal of and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest (including interest accruing during the pendency of any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other similar proceeding, regardless of whether allowed or allowable in such proceeding) on the Notes, when and as due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, upon one or more dates set for prepayment or otherwise, and (B) all other monetary obligations, including fees, costs, expenses and indemnities, whether primary, secondary, direct, contingent, fixed or otherwise (including monetary obligations incurred during the pendency of any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other similar proceeding, regardless of whether allowed or allowable in such proceeding), of the Company to the Noteholders under the Note Agreement and the Notes, and (ii) the due and punctual performance of all covenants, agreements, obligations and liabilities of the Company under or pursuant to the Note Agreement and the Notes; (all the monetary and other obligations referred to in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively called the ). Each Guarantor further agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from such Guarantor, and that such Guarantor will remain bound upon its guarantee notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Guaranteed Obligations.
"Guaranteed Obligations"
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives presentment or protest to, demand of or payment from the Company or any other Guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its guarantee and notice of protest for nonpayment. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (i) the failure of any Noteholder to assert any claim or demand or to enforce or exercise any right or remedy against the Company or any other Guarantor under the provisions of the Note Agreement or any Note or otherwise, (ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of, this Agreement, any Note, any guarantee or any other agreement, including with respect to any other Guarantor under this Agreement, or (iii) the failure to perfect any security interest in, or the release of, any of the security held by or on behalf of any Noteholder.
Each Guarantor further agrees that its guarantee constitutes a guarantee of payment when due and not of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Noteholder to any of the security held for payment of the Guaranteed Obligations or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Noteholder in favor of the Company or any other Person.
The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations), including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of any Noteholder to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under the Note Agreement, any Note or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any provision of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Guaranteed Obligations, or by any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or to the extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or that would otherwise operate as a discharge of each Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Guaranteed Obligations).
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Company or any other Guarantor or the unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Company or any other Guarantor, other than the final and indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Noteholders may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, make any other accommodation with the Company or any other Guarantor or any other guarantor, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations have been fully, finally and indefeasibly paid in cash. Pursuant to applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against the Company or any other Guarantor or guarantor, as the case may be, or any security.
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that any Noteholder has at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Company or any other Guarantor to pay any Guaranteed Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor hereby promises to and will forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Noteholders in cash the amount of such unpaid Guaranteed Obligation. Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums to the Noteholders, all rights of such Guarantor against the Company or any other Guarantor arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Guaranteed Obligations. In addition, any indebtedness of the Company or any other Guarantor now or hereafter held by any Guarantor is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations. If any amount shall erroneously be paid to any Guarantor on account of (i) such subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar right or (ii) any such indebtedness of the Company or any other Guarantor, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Noteholders and shall forthwith be paid to the Noteholders to be credited against the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Notes.
Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Company's and the other Guarantor's financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that none of the Noteholders will have any duty to advise any of the Guarantors of information known to it or any of them regarding such circumstances or risks.
In addition to all such rights of indemnity and subrogation as the Guarantors may have under applicable law (but subject to Section 6), the Company agrees that (a) in the event a payment shall be made by any Guarantor under this Agreement, the Company shall indemnify such Guarantor for the full amount of such payment and such Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the person to whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of such payment and (b) in the event any assets of any Guarantor shall be sold to satisfy a claim of any Noteholder under this Agreement, the Company shall indemnify such Guarantor in an amount equal to the greater of the book value or the fair market value of the assets so sold.
Each Guarantor (a ) agrees (subject to Section 6) that, in the event a payment shall be made by any other Guarantor under this Agreement or assets of any other Guarantor shall be sold to satisfy a claim of any Noteholder and such other Guarantor (the ) shall not have been fully indemnified by the Company as provided in Section 8, the Contributing Guarantor shall indemnify the Claiming Guarantor in an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the greater of the book value or the fair market value of such assets, as the case may be, in each case multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the net worth of the Contributing Guarantor on the date hereof and the denominator shall be the aggregate net worth of all the Guarantors on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Guarantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 21, the date of the Supplement hereto executed and delivered by such Guarantor). Any Contributing Guarantor making any payment to a Claiming Guarantor pursuant to this Section 9 shall be subrogated to the rights of such Claiming Guarantor under Section 8 to the extent of such payment.
"Contributing Guarantor"
"Claiming Guarantor"
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, all rights of the Guarantors under Section 8 and Section 9 and all other rights of indemnity, contribution or subrogation under applicable law or otherwise shall be fully subordinated to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations. No failure on the part of the Company or any Guarantor to make the payments required under applicable law or otherwise shall in any respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor with respect to its obligations hereunder, and each Guarantor shall remain liable for the full amount of the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder.
Each Guarantor represents and warrants as to itself that all representations and warranties relating to it (as a Subsidiary of the Company) contained in the Note Agreement are true and correct in all material respects.
The guarantees made hereunder (i) shall terminate when all the Guaranteed Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full in cash and (ii) shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Noteholder or any Guarantor upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company, any Guarantor or otherwise.
Whenever in this Agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the successors and assigns of such party; and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of the Guarantors that are contained in this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement shall become effective as to any Guarantor when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such Guarantor shall have been delivered to the Noteholders, and thereafter shall be binding upon such Guarantor and their respective successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of such Guarantor, the Noteholders, and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Guarantor shall have the right to assign its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein (and any such attempted assignment shall be void). If all of the capital stock or other equity securities of a Guarantor is sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of pursuant to a transaction permitted by the Note Agreement, such Guarantor shall be released from its obligations under this Agreement without further action. This Agreement shall be construed as a separate agreement with respect to each Guarantor and may be amended, modified, supplemented, waived or released with respect to any Guarantor without the approval of any other Guarantor and without affecting the obligations of any other Guarantor hereunder.
(a) No failure or delay of any Noteholder of any kind in exercising any power, right or remedy hereunder and no course of dealing between any Guarantor on the one hand and any Noteholder on the other hand shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or remedy hereunder, under the Note Agreement or any Note, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a power, right or remedy, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power, right or remedy. The rights of the Noteholders hereunder and under the Notes, as applicable, are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Guarantor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by subsection (b) below, and then such waiver and consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice or demand on any Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Guarantor to any other or further notice in similar or other circumstances.
(b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to a written agreement entered into between the Guarantors with respect to which such waiver, amendment or modification relates and the Required Holders (except as otherwise provided in the Note Agreement) that any amendment hereof with respect to the amount of Guaranteed Obligations pursuant to Section 23 below shall not require the written consent of the Guarantors or the Required Holders and shall have been deemed to have been automatically consented to by each Guarantor and each Noteholder.
provided, however,
All communications and notices hereunder shall be in writing and given as provided in Section 18 of the Note Agreement. All communications and notices hereunder to each Guarantor shall be given to it at its address set forth on Schedule I attached hereto.
Any provision of this Agreement held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such illegality, invalidity or unenforceability without affecting the legality, validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof or thereof; and the illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract (subject to Section 13), and shall become effective as provided in Section 13. Delivery of an executed signature page to this Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto regarding the subject matters hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, regarding such subject matter.
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth for such terms in the Note Agreement.
(a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and be governed by the law (without giving effect to the conflict of law principles thereof) of the State of New York.
(b) Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York state court or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, such Federal court. Each Guarantor agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that any Noteholder may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement against any Guarantor or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.
(c) Each Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding described in paragraph (b) of this Section and brought in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each party hereto irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.
(d) Each Guarantor irrevocably consents to the service of process to the Company on its behalf in the manner provided for notices in Section 22.8 of the Note Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any Noteholder to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.
.
Each party hereto irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in any legal proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of this Agreement, any other Financing Agreement or any hedging document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (whether based on contract, tort or any other theory). Each party hereto (i) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this agreement, the other Notes and the hedging documents by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section
Pursuant to Section 9.7 of the Note Agreement, certain Subsidiaries of the Company will be required to enter into this Agreement as a Guarantor.

The execution and delivery of any instrument adding an additional Guarantor as a party to this Agreement shall not require the consent of any other Guarantor hereunder. The rights and obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the addition of any new Guarantor as a party to this Agreement.
Annex 1
If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Noteholder is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other Indebtedness at any time owing by such Noteholder to or for the credit or the account of any Guarantor against any or all the obligations of such Guarantor now or hereafter existing under this Agreement, irrespective of whether or not such Person shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Noteholder under this Section 22 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Noteholder may have.

et seq.

, today announced record first quarter net income attributable to the company of $12.3 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, on revenues of $722 million. In the same three month period of 2009, the company reported results of $5.0 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, on $697 million of revenues.
MAUMEE, OHIO, MAY 3, 2010The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Grain & Ethanol Group reported a record first quarter operating income of $20.7 million, which was considerably higher than its year earlier result of $5.7 million. This was the result of all three businesses having improved results. The grain business had a record quarter as it benefited from higher space income due in part to the late harvest in 2009. The ethanol business had high earnings despite the decline in ethanol industry margins during the first quarter, as a large percentage of the ethanol had been contracted in advance. The Lansing Trade Group quarterly results were significantly higher than last year. Total first quarter revenues for the Grain & Ethanol Group were $521 million; this includes $210 million of grain and ethanol sales made by the group in accordance with origination and marketing agreements between the company and its ethanol joint ventures. In the first quarter of 2009, the group's total revenues were $481 million and included $206 million of the aforementioned sales. On April 30, the company finalized the previously announced acquisition of the assets of O'Malley Grain, Inc.'s two grain cleaning and storage facilities in Mansfield, IL and Fairmont, NE. This acquisition will allow the group to expand further into the production value chain.
th
The Rail Group's operating income was $1.0 million in the first quarter of 2010, which is comparable to the $0.9 million earned during the same three month period a year ago. Revenues were $27 million for the quarter in both 2010 and 2009. This quarter, the group recognized $2.6 million in gross margin from the scrapping and sale of railcars, whereas last year $0.3 million was recorded. Gross profit from the leasing business was significantly less due primarily to lower utilization rates, and the corresponding carrying costs of idle assets. The group now has approximately 23,400 cars and locomotives, which is down slightly from the prior year. The average utilization rate (the percentage of the fleet in service) for the quarter was 70.0 percent in comparison to 86.8 percent for the same period last year. As of the end of March, utilization had increased to 70.9 percent. Nationwide a significant portion of the total US rail fleet remains idle, however, rail traffic has recently posted moderate improvement. Both the railcar repair and manufacturing businesses continue to be negatively impacted by the overall economic decline.
The Plant Nutrient Group had operating income of $0.7 million during the first quarter of 2010. In the same three month period of 2009, the group reported a $2.0 million operating profit. Revenues for the first quarter of 2010 and 2009 were $103 million and $112 million, respectively. Even though tons sold increased by almost 10 percent, revenues declined in 2010 due to a decrease in the average selling price. Overall margins were down this quarter in comparison to the prior year because early 2009 margins were favorably impacted by high margins on deferred sales and prepay contracts from 2008. Margins have now returned to more normal levels and are meeting the company's expectations.
The Turf & Specialty Group achieved operating income of $2.7 million on $42 million of revenues during the first quarter. Last year, the group reported $3.1 million of income on $45 million of revenues for the period. Turf products tonnage was down slightly from the prior year, however, gross profit per ton increased this quarter due to product mix. The group continues to experience positive results from its focus on proprietary products and expanded product lines.
The Retail Group had an operating loss of $2.8 million during the first quarter of 2010 on revenues of $30 million. During the same period of the prior year the group had an operating loss of $2.7 million, and total same store revenues were $31 million. Customer counts decreased during the quarter in comparison to the prior year. The group continues to be impacted by the weakness in the overall economy; however, margins are remaining relatively stable.
The company recorded a one time adjustment to increase income tax expense by $1.5 million, as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law during the first quarter.
"We are pleased to be able to report record earnings," CEO Mike Anderson stated. "The Grain & Ethanol Group led our results with strong performance in all three areas  grain, ethanol and the Lansing Trade Group investment. As I review these results, I am again reminded that our strategy of purposeful diversification allows us to remain a strong and profitable company even when one or more of our business units is continuing to feel the after effect of last year's recession," added Mr. Anderson.
The company will host a webcast on Tuesday, May 4, 2010 at 11:00 A.M. ET, to discuss its performance. This can be accessed under the heading "Investor" on its website at .

The first six months of both years had revenues of $1.5 billion. It is important to remember that revenues in commodity-based businesses do not serve as good predictors of income or economic performance.
MAUMEE, OHIO, August 4, 2010The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Grain & Ethanol Group's operating income of $19.6 million in the second quarter was significantly higher than its year earlier result of $8.9 million. This was the result of both the grain and ethanol businesses achieving record second quarter results. The grain business benefited primarily from increased space income, which resulted primarily from sizeable basis gains. The ethanol business continued to benefit from a large portion of the ethanol sales being contracted during prior periods, when margins were at high levels. Second quarter 2010 income from the group's investment in Lansing Trade Group was also higher than the prior year. Total second quarter revenues for the group were $474 million; this includes $195 million of grain and ethanol sales made by the Grain & Ethanol Group in accordance with origination and marketing agreements between the company and its ethanol joint ventures. In the second quarter of 2009, the group's total revenues were $500 million and included $188 million of the aforementioned sales. The Grain & Ethanol Group's operating income through the first six months was a record $40.3 million in 2010 and $14.7 million in 2009. Total revenues through June 2010 and 2009 were $995 million and $981 million, respectively. During the quarter, the company finalized the acquisition of the assets of O'Malley Grain, Inc.'s two grain cleaning and storage facilities in Mansfield, Ill and Fairmont, Neb.
The Plant Nutrient Group achieved operating income of $19.0 million during the second quarter of 2010, on revenues of $228 million. This is the second highest second quarter results in the group's history. In the same three month period of 2009, the group had an operating income of $10.3 million on revenues of $198 million. Margins were up slightly from the prior year and tons sold increased by more than a third as the industry returned to more traditional nutrient application rates on phosphates and potassium. Retail farm centers were building and maintaining inventories versus the de-stocking that took place in 2009. The group's first half 2010 operating income was $19.7 million on $332 million of revenues. Last year, its operating income through the first six months was $12.4 million on revenues of $309 million.
The Rail Group's operating income was $0.1 million in the second quarter of 2010, whereas the group earned $0.6 million for the same three month period a year ago. Second quarter revenues were $24 million in both 2010 and 2009. Gross profit from the leasing business was significantly less primarily due to lower utilization rates and the corresponding carrying costs of idle assets. This quarter, the group recognized $1.7 million in gross margin from the scrapping and sale of railcars, whereas last year $0.8 million was recorded. The group has approximately 22,800 cars and locomotives, which is down slightly from the prior year. The average utilization rate (the percentage of the fleet in service) for the quarter was 71.0 percent compared to 80.6 percent for the same period last year. As of the end of June, utilization was 71.4 percent. The rail repair business showed improvement during the second quarter. The group's first half operating income this year was $1.1 million on $50 million of revenues. In 2009, operating income through June was $1.5 million and revenues were $51 million. These results included gains on sales of railcars and related leases of $4.3 million and $1.1 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. During the second quarter the Rail Group made a significant minority investment in a short-line railroad  the Iowa Northern Railway Company.
The Turf & Specialty Group had an operating income of $2.5 million in the second quarter this year on $41 million of revenues. Last year, the group reported a record $3.0 million of operating income on $40 million of revenues for the same period. Turf products tonnage increased slightly, but gross profit per ton decreased due to product mix. Through the first half of 2010, the group's operating income was $5.2 million on $83 million of revenues. Last year, its operating income was a record $6.1 million through the first six months and revenues were $84 million.
The Retail Group had an operating income of $2.1 million during the second quarter of 2010 on revenues of $44 million.

No agreements, conditions, provisions or stipulations contained in this Agreement or in any of the other Financing Agreements, or any Default or Matured Default, or any exercise by the Agent of the right to accelerate the payment of the maturity of principal and interest, or to exercise any option whatsoever, contained in this Agreement or any of the other Financing Agreements, or the arising of any contingency whatsoever, shall entitle the Agent to collect, in any event, interest exceeding the maximum authorized by law, and in no event shall Borrower be obligated to pay interest exceeding such rate, and all agreements, conditions or stipulations, if any, which may in any event or contingency whatsoever operate to bind, obligate or compel Borrower to pay a rate of interest exceeding the maximum allowed by law, shall be without binding force or effect, at law or in equity, to the extent only of the excess of interest over such maximum interest allowed by law. In the event any interest is charged in excess of the maximum allowed by law , Borrower acknowledges and stipulates that any such charge shall be the result of an accidental and bona fide error, and such Excess shall be, first, if a Matured Default has occurred and is continuing, applied to reduce the principal of any Liabilities due, and, second, returned to Borrower, it being the intention of the parties not to enter at any time into a usurious or otherwise illegal relationship. Borrower and the Agent both recognize that, with fluctuations of index rates and applicable margins, such an unintentional result could inadvertently occur. By the execution of this Agreement, Borrower covenants that: (a) the credit or return of any Excess shall constitute the acceptance by Borrower of such Excess; and (b) Borrower shall not seek or pursue any other remedy, legal or equitable, against the Agent based, in whole or in part, upon the charging or receiving of any interest in excess of the maximum authorized by law. For the purpose of determining whether or not any Excess has been contracted for, charged or received by the Agent, all interest at any time contracted for, charged or received by the Agent in connection with the Liabilities shall be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread in equal parts during the entire term of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if for any period of time interest on any of Borrower's obligations is calculated at the Highest Lawful Rate rather than the rate otherwise applicable under this Agreement, and thereafter such applicable rate becomes less than the Highest Lawful Rate, the rate of interest payable on the Borrower's obligations shall remain at the Highest Lawful Rate until the Lenders have received the amount of interest which such Lenders would have received during such period on the Borrower's obligations had the rate of interest not been limited to the Highest Lawful Rate during such period.

All Loans under, and all payments and other amounts received in connection with, this Agreement (including, without limitation, amounts received as a result of the exercise by any Lender of any right of set-off), shall be effectively shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the respective Pro Rata Percentages of the Lenders. If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the principal of, or interest on, or fees in respect of, any amount due to such Lender under this Agreement (other than pursuant to ) in excess of its Pro Rata Percentage of payments on account of similar amounts due to all the Lenders, such Lender shall purchase from the other Lenders such participation in such amounts due to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; , that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (a) the amount of such Lender's required repayment to (b) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. Disproportionate payments of interest shall be shared by the purchase of separate participation in unpaid interest obligations, disproportionate payments of fees shall be shared by the purchase of separate participation in unpaid fee obligations, and disproportionate payments of principal shall be shared by the purchase of separate participation in unpaid principal obligations. Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of Borrower in the amount of such participation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Lender may receive and retain an amount in excess of its Pro Rata Percentage to the extent, but only to the extent, that such excess results from such Lender's Highest Lawful Rate exceeding another Lender's Highest Lawful Rate.

today announced third quarter net income attributable to the company of $1.4 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, on revenues of $707 million. In the third quarter of 2009, the company reported similar results of $1.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, on revenues of $601 million. For the first nine months of 2010, the company earned $38.8 million, or $2.09 per diluted share, on revenues of $2.2 billion. In the same period of 2009, The Andersons reported results of $22.1 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, on $2.1 billion of revenues.
MAUMEE, OHIO, November 3, 2010The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Grain & Ethanol Group's operating income of $2.5 million in the third quarter was below its year earlier result of $8.9 million. The grain business benefited from increased gross profit on grain sales due to the early harvest; however, this was more than offset by a significant decrease in space income, due to basis losses. The ethanol LLC's had a modest loss this quarter primarily because the company had previously, based on its view of the ethanol market at the time, contracted for ethanol sales at minimal margins. The ethanol results were also impacted by rising prices of certain inputs and higher than anticipated maintenance and repair costs. Third quarter 2010 income from the group's investment in Lansing Trade Group was down slightly from the prior year. Total third quarter revenues for the Grain & Ethanol Group were $498 million; including $219 million of grain and ethanol sales made in accordance with origination and marketing agreements between the company and its ethanol joint ventures. In the third quarter of 2009, the group's total revenues were $451 million and included $176 million of the previously mentioned sales. The Grain & Ethanol Group's operating income through the first nine months was a record $42.8 million in 2010 and $23.5 million in 2009. This considerable year-to-date income differential was due to increased performance in all businesses  grain, ethanol, and Lansing Trade Group. Although space income in the grain business was down significantly during the third quarter, space income through September is up from the prior year. Total revenues through September 2010 and 2009 were $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.
The Plant Nutrient Group earned an operating income of $1.5 million during the third quarter of 2010 on revenues of $129 million. In the same three month period of 2009, the group had an operating loss of $2.8 million on revenues of $70 million. Volume was up 60 percent due to re-stocking of the nutrient pipeline spurred by rising grain prices, an early harvest, and favorable application weather throughout the Midwest. Margins were also improved year over year, during the third quarter, due to price escalation. The group's first nine months' operating income this year was $21.2 million on $461 million of revenues. Last year, its operating income through the first nine months was $9.6 million on revenues of $380 million. This year to year improvement was due primarily to a significant increase in volume as spring and fall application rates of potassium and phosphate returned to more normal levels and to the re-stocking which occurred in the third quarter.
The Rail Group had an operating income of $0.1 million in the third quarter of 2010 on revenues of $22 million. The group lost $1.1 million and had revenues of $21 million during the same three month period a year ago. Gross profit from the leasing business was down for the quarter due primarily to lower utilization rates and the corresponding storage expense from idle assets. The average utilization rate for the quarter was 72.9 percent in comparison to 74.4 percent for the same period last year. Increased leasing activity late in the quarter caused the utilization as of September 30 to increase to 75.6 percent. The group has approximately 22,600 cars and locomotives, which is down from the prior year total of 24,000 units due to the selective scrapping of over 1,500 railcars this year. All other operations showed nice improvement this quarter. The short-line railroad in which the group invested last quarter showed solid performance. The group's first nine months operating income this year was $1.2 million on $73 million of revenues. In 2009, operating income through September was $0.4 million and revenues were $72 million.
The Turf & Specialty Group reported an operating loss of $0.3 million in the third quarter for both this year and the prior year. A $1.3 million non-recurring gain was recognized in the prior year. Third quarter revenues for the group were $23 million, which is up $2 million from the prior year. Both turf products tonnage and gross profit per ton increased during the third quarter, in comparison to the prior year. Through the first nine months of 2010, the group's operating income was $4.9 million on $106 million of revenues. Last year, its operating income was a record $5.8 million for the same period on similar revenues.
The Retail Group had an operating loss of $1.7 million in the third quarter of 2010 on revenues of $34 million. In the comparable period last year, the group's operating loss was $2.3 million and total revenues were $37 million. Through nine months, the group recorded a loss of $2.4 million and total revenues of $108 million. Last year through September the group lost $2.1 million on total revenues of $120 million.
"We had mixed results this quarter," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mike Anderson. "We were pleased with the performance of the Plant Nutrient Group, which typically has little to no income during the third quarter. The increase in railcar lease renewals at the end of the quarter and the resulting increase in the utilization rate were encouraging to see. Conversely, our Grain & Ethanol Group's results for the quarter were lower due primarily to the decreased performance of our ethanol business. Our grain business was impacted by a decline in wheat basis, which we expect to be regained through the balance of the wheat crop year. As it relates to our results through September, the Grain & Ethanol Group had record results of $42.8 million, and our Plant Nutrient Group is having their second best year, surpassed only by the unprecedented earnings seen in 2008.," added Mr. Anderson.
The company will host a webcast on Thursday, November 4, 2010 at 11:00 A.M. ET, to discuss its performance. This can be accessed under the heading "Investor" on its website at .

No such assignment and/or pledge shall release the assigning and/or pledging Lender from its obligations hereunder.

No agreements, conditions, provisions or stipulations contained in this Agreement or in any of the other Financing Agreements, or any Default or Matured Default, or any exercise by the Agent of the right to accelerate the payment of the maturity of principal and interest, or to exercise any option whatsoever, contained in this Agreement or any of the other Financing Agreements, or the arising of any contingency whatsoever, shall entitle the Agent to collect, in any event, interest exceeding the maximum authorized by law, and in no event shall Borrower be obligated to pay interest exceeding such rate, and all agreements, conditions or stipulations, if any, which may in any event or contingency whatsoever operate to bind, obligate or compel Borrower to pay a rate of interest exceeding the maximum allowed by law, shall be without binding force or effect, at law or in equity, to the extent only of the excess of interest over such maximum interest allowed by law. In the event any interest is charged in excess of the maximum allowed by law , Borrower acknowledges and stipulates that any such charge shall be the result of an accidental and bona fide error, and such Excess shall be, first, if a Matured Default has occurred and is continuing, applied to reduce the principal of any Liabilities due, and, second, returned to Borrower, it being the intention of the parties not to enter at any time into a usurious or otherwise illegal relationship. Borrower and the Agent both recognize that, with fluctuations of index rates and applicable margins, such an unintentional result could inadvertently occur. By the execution of this Agreement, Borrower covenants that: (a) the credit or return of any Excess shall constitute the acceptance by Borrower of such Excess; and (b) Borrower shall not seek or pursue any other remedy, legal or equitable, against the Agent based, in whole or in part, upon the charging or receiving of any interest in excess of the maximum authorized by law. For the purpose of determining whether or not any Excess has been contracted for, charged or received by the Agent, all interest at any time contracted for, charged or received by the Agent in connection with the Liabilities shall be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread in equal parts during the entire term of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if for any period of time interest on any of Borrower's obligations is calculated at the Highest Lawful Rate rather than the rate otherwise applicable under this Agreement, and thereafter such applicable rate becomes less than the Highest Lawful Rate, the rate of interest payable on the Borrower's obligations shall remain at the Highest Lawful Rate until the Lenders have received the amount of interest which such Lenders would have received during such period on the Borrower's obligations had the rate of interest not been limited to the Highest Lawful Rate during such period.

Obligations Several

All Loans under, and all payments and other amounts received in connection with, this Agreement (including, without limitation, amounts received as a result of the exercise by any Lender of any right of set-off), shall be effectively shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the respective Pro Rata Percentages of the Lenders. If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the principal of, or interest on, or fees in respect of, any amount due to such Lender under this Agreement (other than pursuant to or the normal and customary processing fees charged by an Issuer in connection with the Issuance of or drawings under a Letter) in excess of its Pro Rata Percentage of payments on account of similar amounts due to all the Lenders, such Lender shall purchase from the other Lenders such participation in such amounts due to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; , that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (a) the amount of such Lender's required repayment to (b) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. Disproportionate payments of interest shall be shared by the purchase of separate participation in unpaid interest obligations, disproportionate payments of fees shall be shared by the purchase of separate participation in unpaid fee obligations, and disproportionate payments of principal shall be shared by the purchase of separate participation in unpaid principal obligations. Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of Borrower in the amount of such participation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Lender may receive and retain an amount in excess of its Pro Rata Percentage to the extent, but only to the extent, that such excess results from such Lender's Highest Lawful Rate exceeding another Lender's Highest Lawful Rate.

, today announced record fourth quarter net income attributable to the company of $25.8 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.2 billion. In the same three month period of 2009, the company reported income of $16.2 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, on revenues of $916 million. The company's 2010 full year results were its second highest with earnings of $64.7 million, or $3.48 per diluted share, on $3.4 billion of revenues. In the prior year, the company earned $38.4 million, or $2.08 per diluted share, and total revenues were $3.0 billion.
MAUMEE, OHIO, FEBRUARY 8, 2011The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Grain & Ethanol Group's 2010 operating income was a record $81.4 million. This compares to operating income of $51.4 million in 2009. These results were led by the grain business, which achieved a best ever performance due primarily to strong space income. The ethanol business and the investment in Lansing Trade Group also had solid performances. Total 2010 revenues for the Grain & Ethanol Group were $2.4 billion; this includes $928 million of grain and ethanol sales made in accordance with origination and marketing agreements between the company and its ethanol joint ventures. In 2009, the group's total revenues were $2.2 billion and included $806 million of the previously mentioned sales. For the fourth quarter, the group's operating income was a record $38.6 million, in contrast to $27.8 million earned during the same period in 2009. The fourth quarter increase in operating income was due to markedly improved results in both the grain business and Lansing Trade Group. The grain business benefited from significant space income and the net reversal of $6.7 million of reserves following the settlement of a long standing collection matter. The ethanol business returned to profitability in the fourth quarter, but its results were significantly below the same period of the prior year. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $913 million; in comparison, the group's revenues for the same period last year were $722 million.
The Plant Nutrient Group ended the year with record operating income of $30.1 million due primarily to an increase in volume of more than 30 percent. In 2009, the group had an operating income of $11.3 million. Revenues for 2010 and 2009 were $619 million and $491 million, respectively. Revenues increased in 2010 due to the volume increase, which was partially offset by a modest decrease in the average selling price. For the fourth quarter, the group's operating income was a record $8.9 million on $159 million of revenues. Last year the group had operating income of $1.7 million during the same three month period on revenues of $111 million. The significant improvement in the fourth quarter was due to material increases in both volume and gross margin. Volume was up almost 20 percent due to excellent fall application conditions and the continued re-stocking of the retail pipeline. Gross margin increased primarily due to price escalation.
The Rail Group had operating income of $0.1 million in 2010, an improvement over its $1.0 million loss in 2009. Gross profit from the leasing business was significantly lower than the prior year due mainly to lower average utilization and lease rates. The full year results include gains on sales of railcars and related leases of $5.5 million in 2010 and $1.7 million in 2009. The majority of the 2010 gains, or $4.3 million, related to the scrapping of railcars. The average utilization rate for 2010 was 73.6 percent, which was down from the prior year average of 78.1 percent. However, the group ended the year with an improved utilization rate of 81.7 percent. Revenues of $95 million for 2010 were comparable to the $93 million reported in the prior year. The Rail Group had an operating loss of $1.1 million in the fourth quarter on revenues of $22 million. In 2009, the operating loss for the same three month period was $1.5 million on revenues of $21 million.
The Turf & Specialty Group's full year operating income was $3.4 million on revenues of $124 million. In 2009, the group had operating income of $4.7 million, and total revenues were $125 million. The 2009 results included a $1.3 million non-recurring gain. The group incurred an operating loss of $1.4 million in the fourth quarter on revenues of $18 million. Last year, its operating loss for the same period was $1.1 million on revenues of $19 million.
The Retail Group had an operating loss of $2.5 million in 2010. In the prior year, the group's operating loss was $2.8 million. Total sales for the group were $151 million in 2010, or 7 percent below the 2009 total of $162 million. The Retail Group's fourth quarter operating loss was $0.1 million on revenues of $43 million. Last year, during the same three month period, the operating loss was $0.7 million, and total revenues were $42 million.
"Clearly, both our full year and fourth quarter earnings were heavily influenced by the results within our agricultural business units. The record full year and quarterly earnings in both our Grain & Ethanol and Plant Nutrient groups, reflects our solid position in this industry," CEO Mike Anderson stated. "Our 2010 Rail Group results continue to be negatively impacted by the overall economy. The increase in utilization rate at the end of the year, however, was encouraging to see," Mr. Anderson added. "We intend to continue to serve our customers and grow this company as we did in 2010 with the addition of O'Malley Grain, B4Grain, and our significant investment in the Iowa Northern Railroad."
The company will host a webcast on Wednesday, February 9, 2011 at 11:00 A.M. ET, to discuss its performance. This can be accessed under the heading "Investor" on its website at .

NEWS RELEASE

, today announced record first quarter net income attributable to the company of $17.3 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.0 billion. In the same three month period of 2010, the company reported results of $12.3 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, on $722 million of revenues.
MAUMEE, OHIO, MAY 4, 2011The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
During the quarter, the company re-evaluated its reportable segments. As a result, the Grain & Ethanol Group was separated into two reportable segments, specifically the Grain Division and the Ethanol Division. The company's investment in Lansing Trade Group is included in the Grain Division. Segment information for earlier periods has been restated for comparability purposes.
Although the Grain Division led the company in first quarter income, the Plant Nutrient Group enjoyed the largest year to year increase in income. Continued good carry in the grain markets, particularly wheat, coupled with improved farm income opportunity created favorable fundamentals for our traditional agricultural businesses in the first quarter. Increased demand for U.S. exports of grains and other agricultural products to feed an ever growing world population along with the U.S. corn based ethanol demand continues to create positive agriculture fundamentals.
The Grain & Ethanol Group reported first quarter operating income of $18.7 million, which was just $2.0 million lower than its year earlier record result of $20.7 million. These results were led by the Grain Division. The division reported record operating income of $15.1 million in the first quarter of 2011, and $12.2 million for the same period of the prior year. The division benefited from continued strong space income and record first quarter earnings from the investment in Lansing Trade Group. Revenues for the Grain Division were $639 million and $402 million for the first quarter of 2011 and 2010, respectively. Revenues increased significantly due to the overall climb in grain prices.
The Ethanol Division earned an operating income of $3.6 million in the first quarter. This compares to $8.5 million earned during the same period of the prior year. The decreased income is the result of a decline in the company's earnings from the ethanol LLC's, which have been negatively impacted by lower ethanol margins. Total revenues for the quarter were $132 million. In comparison, the division's revenues for the same period last year were $119 million.
The Plant Nutrient Group achieved operating income of $5.1 million during the first quarter. In the same three month period of 2010, the group reported $0.7 million of operating income. This improved performance was due entirely to an increase in margin. Volume was virtually unchanged from the prior year. The margin improvement is primarily the result of the lagging effect of price escalation in the second half of 2010. Revenues for the first quarter of 2011 and 2010 were $124 million and $103 million, respectively. Revenues grew due to an increase in the average selling price per ton.
The Rail Group had an operating income of $3.5 million in the first quarter on revenues of $29 million. In the same three month period of 2010, the group earned $1.0 million and revenues were $27 million. This quarter, the group recognized $4.8 million in gains on sales of railcars and related leases, whereas last year $2.6 million was recorded. Gross profit from the leasing business was lower due primarily to lower average lease rates, decreased end of lease income, and increased maintenance expense incurred when preparing cars to return to service. The average utilization rate for the quarter was 82 percent in comparison to 70 percent for the same period last year.
The Turf & Specialty Group earned operating income of $3.3 million on $47 million of revenues during the first quarter. Last year, the group reported $2.7 million of income on $42 million of revenues for the period. Turf products tonnage was up from the prior year, however, margin per ton decreased slightly due to changing product mix.
The Retail Group had an operating loss of $2.7 million during the first quarter on revenues of $31 million. During the same period of the prior year the group had a loss of $2.8 million, and total revenues were $30 million.
In the prior year, the company recorded a one time adjustment to increase income tax expense by $1.5 million, as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law during the first quarter of 2010. This adjustment had an earnings per share impact of $0.09 on the 2010 first quarter results.
"We are pleased to be able to report record first quarter earnings," CEO Mike Anderson stated. "The investments made in our agricultural businesses over the last several years, including our investment in Lansing Trade Group, are paying off nicely in this very positive agricultural environment. It is also worth noting that the quarterly operating results for each of our non- agricultural businesses improved over the prior year result as well," added Mr. Anderson.
The company will host a webcast on Thursday, May 5, 2011 at 11:00 A.M. ET, to discuss its performance. This can be accessed under the heading "Investor" on its website at .

, today announced second quarter net income attributable to the company of $45.2 million, or $2.42 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.3 billion. In the same three month period of 2010, the company reported results of $25.2 million, or $1.36 per diluted share, on revenues of $811 million. During the first six months of 2011, the company earned a record $62.5 million, or $3.34 per diluted share. In the first half of 2010, The Andersons reported results of $37.4 million, or $2.02 per diluted share. The revenue for the first six months of 2011 and 2010 were $2.3 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. It is important to remember that revenues in commodity-based businesses do not serve as good predictors of income or economic performance.
MAUMEE, OHIO, August 3, 2011The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Grain Division led the company's second quarter income with its record results. The Plant Nutrient Group also had highly favorable results. Higher than usual space income in the grain markets, particularly wheat, along with favorable fundamentals in other areas of the agricultural sector impacted the second quarter results.
The Grain & Ethanol Group reported record second quarter operating income of $45.3 million, which was more than double its year earlier result of $19.6 million. The group had record operating income through June of $64.0 million this year, in comparison to first half 2010 operating income of $40.3 million.
The Grain Division reported record operating income of $36.5 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $13.4 million for the same period last year. The division benefited from continued strong space income as a result of significant basis gains that were realized earlier in the year than is typical, and good second quarter earnings from its investment in Lansing Trade Group. Revenues for the Grain Division were $797 million and $361 million for the second quarter of 2011 and 2010, respectively. Revenues increased significantly due primarily to higher grain prices. The Grain Division's operating income for the first six months of the year was $51.6 million on revenues of $1.4 billion. Last year, its first half operating income was $25.6 million on revenues of $763 million.
The Ethanol Division earned an operating income of $8.8 million in the second quarter. This compares to $6.2 million earned during the same period of the prior year. The higher income is the result of an increase in the company's earnings from its investments in its three ethanol limited liability company affiliates. Total revenues for the quarter were $165 million. In comparison, the division's revenues for the same period last year were $113 million. Revenues increased primarily due to higher ethanol prices. The Ethanol Division's operating income through June was $12.4 million on revenues of $297 million. In the prior year, its first half operating income was $14.8 million on revenues of $232 million.
The Plant Nutrient Group achieved operating income of $24.1 million during the second quarter of 2011, on revenues of $260 million. In the same three month period of 2010, the group had an operating income of $19.0 million on revenues of $228 million. This improved performance was due primarily to an increase in margin, as volume declined year over year. Margins were strong primarily as a result of nutrient price appreciation attributable to strong world demand and to a lesser extent due to a favorable product mix that included more value added products. The group's first half 2011 operating income was $29.2 million on $383 million of revenues. Last year, the operating income through the first six months was $19.7 million on revenues of $332 million. Increased revenues this year are due to higher selling prices.
The Rail Group had an operating income of $2.8 million in the second quarter on revenues of $30 million. In the same three month period of 2010, the group earned $0.1 million and revenues were $24 million. This quarter, the group recognized $2.3 million in gains on sales of railcars and related leases, whereas last year a gain of $1.7 million was recorded. Gross profit from the leasing business was also higher. The average utilization rate for the quarter was 85 percent in comparison to 71 percent for the same period last year. The group's first half operating income this year was $6.3 million on $58 million of revenues. In 2010, operating income through June was $1.1 million and revenues were $50 million. These results included gains on sales of railcars and related leases of $7.1 million and $4.3 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively.
The Turf & Specialty Group had an operating income of $1.8 million in the second quarter this year on $42 million of revenues. Last year, the group reported operating income of $2.5 million on $41 million of revenues for the same period. Turf products tonnage decreased slightly, and gross profit per ton declined due to higher input costs. Through the first half of 2011, the group's operating income was $5.1 million, which is similar to the prior year's result. The group's revenues for 2011 and 2010 through June were $89 million and $83 million, respectively.
The Retail Group had an operating income of $1.9 million during the second quarter of 2011 on revenues of $45 million. During the same period of the prior year, the group had an operating income of $2.1 million and revenues were $44 million. Through the first six months, the group lost $0.8 million and revenues were $77 million. Last year through June, the group lost $0.7 million on revenues of $74 million.
"We are pleased to be able to report record year to date earnings. While we have always mentioned that our second and fourth quarters are strong for us, these second quarter results were unusually strong due to the significant and accelerated grain basis income," CEO Mike Anderson stated. "The investments made in our agricultural businesses over the last several years are benefitting from a positive agricultural environment. I am particularly proud of the Grain Division's record results this year as well as PNG's strong second quarter results in the face of a delayed spring planting season. It is also worth noting that the environment in the Rail industry has improved and we believe the worst is behind us," added Mr. Anderson.
The company will host a webcast on Thursday, August 4, 2011 at 11:00 A.M. ET, to discuss its performance. This can be accessed under the heading "Investor" on its website at .

E-mail: nickconrad@andersonsinc.com
today announced third quarter net income attributable to the company of $10.9 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, on revenues of $939 million. In the third quarter of 2010, the company reported results of $1.4 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, on revenues of $707 million. For the first nine months of 2011, the company earned a record $73.4 million, or $3.92 per diluted share, on revenues of $3.3 billion. In the same period of 2010, The Andersons reported results of $38.8 million, or $2.09 per diluted share, on $2.2 billion of revenues. The majority of the year to year revenue increase relates to rising prices in our agricultural businesses. It is important to remember that revenues in commodity-based businesses may not serve as good indicators of income or economic performance.
MAUMEE, OHIO, November 8, 2011The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Grain & Ethanol Group reported third quarter operating income of $12.8 million, which was significantly higher than its year earlier result of $2.5 million. The group had record operating income through September of $76.8 million, in comparison to operating income of $42.8 million for the same period in 2010.
The Grain Division reported operating income of $8.3 million in the third quarter of 2011 versus $3.2 million for the same period last year. The division benefited from continued strong space income and record third quarter earnings from its investment in Lansing Trade Group. Revenues for the Grain Division were $539 million and $389 million for the third quarter of 2011 and 2010, respectively. Revenues increased significantly due to higher grain prices. The Grain Division's operating income for the first nine months of the year was $60.0 million on revenues of $2.0 billion. Last year, its operating income through September was $28.8 million on revenues of $1.2 billion.
The Ethanol Division earned an operating income of $4.4 million in the third quarter. This compares to a loss of $0.8 million during the same period of the prior year. The higher income is the result of an increase in the company's earnings from the investment in three ethanol limited liability company affiliates. Total revenues for the quarter were $179 million. In comparison, the division's revenues for the same period last year were $109 million. Revenues increased primarily due to higher ethanol prices. The Ethanol Division's operating income through September was $16.8 million on revenues of $477 million. In the prior year, its operating income for the same period was $14.0 million on revenues of $341 million.
The Plant Nutrient Group achieved operating income of $6.6 million during the third quarter of 2011 on revenues of $138 million. In the same three month period of 2010, the group had an operating income of $1.5 million on revenues of $129 million. This improved performance was due primarily to an increase in margin. Margins were strong primarily as a result of nutrient price appreciation. Total volume was down, year over year, primarily due to re-stocking of the nutrient pipeline some of which occurred in the prior quarter. The group's first nine months' operating income this year was $35.8 million on $521 million of revenues. Last year, its operating income through the first nine months was $21.2 million on revenues of $461 million. Increased revenues this year are due to higher selling prices.
The Rail Group had an operating income of $1.1 million in the third quarter on revenues of $24 million. In the same three month period of 2010, the group earned $0.1 million and revenues were $22 million.

No agreements, conditions, provisions or stipulations contained in this Agreement or in any of the other Financing Agreements, or any Default or Matured Default, or any exercise by the Agent of the right to accelerate the payment of the maturity of principal and interest, or to exercise any option whatsoever, contained in this Agreement or any of the other Financing Agreements, or the arising of any contingency whatsoever, shall entitle the Agent to collect, in any event, interest exceeding the maximum authorized by law, and in no event shall Borrower be obligated to pay interest exceeding such rate, and all agreements, conditions or stipulations, if any, which may in any event or contingency whatsoever operate to bind, obligate or compel Borrower to pay a rate of interest exceeding the maximum allowed by law, shall be without binding force or effect, at law or in equity, to the extent only of the excess of interest over such maximum interest allowed by law. In the event any interest is charged in excess of the maximum allowed by law , Borrower acknowledges and stipulates that any such charge shall be the result of an accidental and bona fide error, and such Excess shall be, first, if a Matured Default has occurred and is continuing, applied to reduce the principal of any Liabilities due, and, second, returned to Borrower, it being the intention of the parties not to enter at any time into a usurious or otherwise illegal relationship. Borrower and the Agent both recognize that, with fluctuations of index rates and applicable margins, such an unintentional result could inadvertently occur. By the execution of this Agreement, Borrower covenants that: (a) the credit or return of any Excess shall constitute the acceptance by Borrower of such Excess; and (b) Borrower shall not seek or pursue any other remedy, legal or equitable, against the Agent based, in whole or in part, upon the charging or receiving of any interest in excess of the maximum authorized by law. For the purpose of determining whether or not any Excess has been contracted for, charged or received by the Agent, all interest at any time contracted for, charged or received by the Agent in connection with the Liabilities shall be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread in equal parts during the entire term of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if for any period of time interest on any of Borrower's obligations is calculated at the Highest Lawful Rate rather than the rate otherwise applicable under this Agreement, and thereafter such applicable rate becomes less than the Highest Lawful Rate, the rate of interest payable on the Borrower's obligations shall remain at the Highest Lawful Rate until the Lenders have received the amount of interest which such Lenders would have received during such period on the Borrower's obligations had the rate of interest not been limited to the Highest Lawful Rate during such period.

All Loans under, and all payments and other amounts received in connection with, this Agreement (including, without limitation, amounts received as a result of the exercise by any Lender of any right of set-off), shall be effectively shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the respective Pro Rata Percentages of the Lenders. If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the principal of, or interest on, or fees in respect of, any amount due to such Lender under this Agreement (other than pursuant to , the normal and customary processing fees charged by an Issuer in connection with the Issuance of or drawings under a Letter, or with respect to Bank Products Obligations as provided by ) in excess of its Pro Rata Percentage of payments on account of similar amounts due to all the Lenders, such Lender shall purchase from the other Lenders such participation in such amounts due to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; , that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (a) the amount of such Lender's required repayment to (b) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. Disproportionate payments of interest shall be shared by the purchase of separate participation in unpaid interest obligations, disproportionate payments of fees shall be shared by the purchase of separate participation in unpaid fee obligations, and disproportionate payments of principal shall be shared by the purchase of separate participation in unpaid principal obligations. Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of Borrower in the amount of such participation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Lender may receive and retain an amount in excess of its Pro Rata Percentage to the extent, but only to the extent, that such excess results from such Lender's Highest Lawful Rate exceeding another Lender's Highest Lawful Rate.

E-mail: nickconrad@andersonsinc.com
MAUMEE, OHIO, FEBRUARY 8, 2012The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE), today announced record net income attributable to the company of $95.1 million, or $5.09 per diluted share, on revenues of $4.6 billion. In the prior year, the company earned $64.7 million, or $3.48 per diluted share, and total revenues were $3.4 billion. The company earned $21.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, or $1.17 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.3 billion. In the same three month period of 2010, the company reported income of $25.8 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.2 billion. The majority of the year to year revenue increase relates to rising prices in its agricultural businesses. It is important to remember that revenues in commodity-based businesses may not serve as good indicators of income or economic performance.
The Grain Group's 2011 operating income was a record $87.3 million. This compares to operating income of $64.4 million in 2010. The group achieved this performance due primarily to significant space income, which was impacted by substantial wheat basis appreciation and spread gains. Additionally, Lansing Trade Group had its best ever annual performance. Total revenues for the Grain Group were $2.8 billion and $1.9 billion in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Revenues increased significantly due to higher grain prices. For the fourth quarter, the group's operating income was $27.3 million on revenues of $876 million. In the same three month period of 2010, the group had income of $35.6 million on revenue of $785 million. For the quarter, the grain business benefited from strong space income, the reversal of a $3.2 million bad debt reserve, and solid performance by Lansing Trade Group.
The Ethanol Group achieved an operating income of $23.3 million in 2011. This compares to $17.0 million in the prior year. The higher income is the result of an increase in the company's earnings from its investment in three ethanol limited liability companies. The ethanol plants have continued to maximize efficiency; additionally the plants have invested further in corn oil, E-85, and CO2, which have proven to be profitable business additions. Total revenues for the year were $642 million. In comparison, the group's revenues for the prior year were $469 million. Revenues increased primarily due to higher ethanol prices. The group's fourth quarter operating income was $6.5 million on revenues of $165 million. During the same three month period of 2010, its operating income was $3.0 million on revenues of $128 million.
The Plant Nutrient Group ended the year with record operating income of $38.3 million due primarily to an increase in margin resulting mainly from nutrient price appreciation and to a lesser degree from product mix. In 2010, the group had an operating income of $30.1 million. Revenues for 2011 and 2010 were $691 million and $619 million, respectively. Revenues increased in 2011 due to higher nutrient prices, which were partially offset by a decrease in volume. For the fourth quarter, the group's operating income was $2.5 million on $170 million of revenues. Last year the group had operating income of $8.9 million during the same three month period on revenues of $159 million. The income decline in the fourth quarter includes $4.7 million of charges due to the recording of a lower of cost or market inventory adjustment and asset impairment charges.
The Rail Group had operating income of $9.8 million in 2011, a significant improvement over its $0.1 million income in 2010. Gross profit from the leasing business was significantly higher than the prior year due mainly to higher utilization and lease rates. The full year results include gains on sales of railcars and related leases of $8.4 million and $5.5 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The average utilization rate for 2011 was 84.6 percent, which was up from the prior year average of 73.6 percent. Revenues of $107 million for 2011 were higher than the $95 million reported in the prior year. The Rail Group had an operating income of $2.3 million in the fourth quarter on revenues of $25 million. In 2010, the operating loss for the same three month period was $1.1 million on revenues of $22 million.
The Turf & Specialty Group's full year operating income was $2.0 million on revenues of $130 million. In 2010, the group had operating income of $3.4 million, and total revenues were $124 million. The group incurred an operating loss of $1.8 million in the fourth quarter on revenues of $18 million. Last year, its operating loss for the same period was $1.4 million on similar revenues.
The Retail Group had an operating loss of $1.5 million in 2011. In the prior year, the group's operating loss was $2.5 million. Total sales for the group were $158 million in 2011, or 5 percent above the prior year total of $151 million. The Retail Group's fourth quarter operating income was $0.5 million on revenues of $45 million. Last year, during the same three month period, the operating loss was $0.1 million and total revenues were $43 million.
"Clearly, both our full year and fourth quarter earnings were heavily influenced by the results within our agricultural businesses. The record full year earnings in both our Grain and Plant Nutrient Groups, and second best year in the Ethanol Group, is gratifying," CEO Mike Anderson stated. "Our 2011 Rail Group results improved significantly from the prior year as a result of improved economic conditions." Mr. Anderson added. "In the last year we have demonstrated our commitment to growth by adding 1.7 million bushels of grain storage capacity, beginning construction on a grain shuttle loader facility in Nebraska, and acquiring two businesses in the Plant Nutrient Group  Immokalee Farmer Supply in Florida in October of 2011, and New Eezy Gro, an Ohio based company, last week. We intend to continue to pursue our growth strategy in 2012 and beyond."
The company will host a webcast on Thursday, February 9, 2012 at 11:00 A.M. ET, to discuss its performance. This can be accessed under the heading "Investor" on its website at .

, today announced record first quarter net income attributable to the company of $18.4 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.1 billion. In the same three month period of 2011, the company reported results of $17.3 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, on $1.0 billion of revenues.
MAUMEE, OHIO, MAY 7, 2012 The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
The Grain Group reported record first quarter operating income of $19.4 million in 2012, and $15.1 million for the same period of the prior year. The group benefited from strong space income and very good first quarter earnings from the investment in Lansing Trade Group. First quarter revenues for the group were $700 million and $638 million for 2012 and 2011, respectively. Revenues increased due to a slight increase in both the average grain price and bushels sold.
The Ethanol Group had operating income of $0.1 million in the first quarter. This compares to $3.6 million earned during the same period of 2011. The decreased income is the result of a decline in the company's earnings from its ethanol investment affiliates, whose income was negatively impacted by lower ethanol margins resulting from increased industry production and lower demand led by declining exports. There was, however, increased income from corn oil, E-85, and CO2. Total revenues for the quarter were $151 million. In comparison, the group's revenues for the same period last year were $133 million. The revenue increase is primarily due to an increase in the average price per gallon.
The Plant Nutrient Group achieved operating income of $5.8 million during the first quarter. In the same three month period of 2011, the group reported $5.1 million of operating income. This improved performance was due entirely to an increase in volume. Margin was down slightly from the prior year due to lower price appreciation. The volume increase is primarily the result of good application weather in March and pent up demand from the fourth quarter of 2011. Revenues for the first quarter of 2012 and 2011 were $175 million and $124 million, respectively. Revenues grew due to an increase in both the average selling price and volume.
The Rail Group had record first quarter operating income of $8.0 million on revenues of $36 million. In the same three month period of 2011, the group earned $3.5 million and revenues were $29 million. The group's revenue and income benefitted from higher utilization and lease rates. The group recognized $6.3 million in gains on sales of railcars and related leases, whereas last year during the same quarter $4.8 million was recorded. The average utilization rate for the quarter was 85.7 percent in comparison to 82.4 percent for the same period last year. Income from the railcar repair business has also increased considerably.
The Turf & Specialty Group reported operating income of $2.2 million on $45 million of revenues during the first quarter. Last year, the group reported $3.3 million of income on $47 million of revenues for the period.
The Retail Group had an operating loss of $2.7 million during the first quarter of both 2012 and 2011. Revenues for both years were also comparable at $30 million and $31 million for 2012 and 2011, respectively.
"Our agricultural businesses continue to perform well. Although we will not see the same wheat basis gains we did last year, we are pleased with the year-to-date corn planting progress, on what is expected to be an approximate 96 million acre crop. It is also gratifying to report record earnings in our Rail Group, which struggled for a few years during the economic downturn," CEO Mike Anderson stated. "Quality growth investments continue to be a priority for us. In January, we added New Eezy Gro, to our Plant Nutrient Group; an Ohio based specialty agricultural and industrial company with two locations. Last week, our new ethanol investment affiliate, The Andersons Denison Ethanol LLC, acquired an existing ethanol plant in Denison, Iowa from Amaizing Energy Company. We will operate the plant and handle all marketing and origination services as we do for the other three ethanol LLCs in which we have an investment," added Mr. Anderson.
"In spite of the above we believe the second quarter will be challenging, primarily due to the expectation of a significant drop in wheat space income in the Grain Group. Lower margins are also expected during the second quarter in both our Ethanol and Plant Nutrient groups. We do believe, however, that these factors will be partially offset by significantly increased performance in Rail. Overall, we expect 2012 to be our second best year ever," concluded Mr. Anderson.
The company will host a webcast on Tuesday, May 8, 2012 at 11:00 A.M. ET, to discuss its performance. This can be accessed under the heading "Investor" on its website at .

THE ANDERSONS, INC. REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
Second Quarter Earnings of $1.56 per Diluted Share
The Grain, Plant Nutrient and Rail Groups Lead Earning Results
MAUMEE, OHIO, August 2, 2012-The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
, today announced second quarter net income attributable to the company of $29.2 million, or $1.56 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.3 billion. In the same three month period of 2011, the company reported results of $45.2 million, or $2.42 per diluted share on similar revenues. During the first six months of 2012, the company earned $47.6 million, or $2.54 per diluted share. In the first half of 2011, The Andersons reported record results of $62.5 million, or $3.34 per diluted share. The revenue for the first six months of 2012 and 2011 were $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively.
The Grain Group reported operating income of $15.3 million in the second quarter of 2012 and $36.5 million for the same period last year, driven primarily by a return to more normal space income. As noted previously, wheat space income in the second quarter of the prior year was extraordinary and likely not repeatable. The group benefited from record second quarter earnings from its investment in Lansing Trade Group. Revenues for the Grain Group were $719 million and $797 million for the quarter in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The group's operating income for the first six months was $34.7 million on revenues of $1.4 billion. Last year, its first half operating income was $51.6 million on similar revenues.
The Ethanol Group had an operating loss of $2.1 million in the second quarter, compared to earnings of $8.8 million during the same period last year. The loss was primarily the result of a decrease in the company's earnings from its ethanol investment affiliates, whose income was significantly impacted by lower ethanol margins resulting from increased corn costs and lower ethanol demand. Income from co-products such as corn-oil, E-85, and CO2 continued to have a positive impact on the financials. Total revenues for the quarter in 2012 and 2011 were comparable at $168 million and $165 million, respectively. The group's operating loss through June was $2.0 million on revenues of $318 million. Last year, its first half operating income was $12.4 million on revenues of $297 million.
The Plant Nutrient Group achieved operating income of $28.0 million during the second quarter on revenues of $309 million. In the same three month period of 2011, the group had operating income of $24.1 million on revenues of $260 million. This improved performance was due to increased volume. Margins were down slightly year over year, but still historically strong. The group's first half 2012 operating income was $33.8 million on $484 million of revenues. Last year, the operating income through the first six months was $29.2 million on revenues of $383 million.
The Rail Group achieved record operating income of $7.2 million in the second quarter on revenues of $32 million. In the same three month period of 2011, the group earned $2.8 million and revenues were $30 million. This quarter, the group recognized $2.4 million in gains on sales of railcars and related
leases and non-recourse transactions, which is comparable to the gain of $2.3 million recorded in the prior year. Gross profit from the leasing business was significantly higher due primarily to an increase in the average lease rate. The average utilization rate for the quarter was approximately 85 percent, which is consistent with last year. Income from the railcar repair business increased considerably as well. The group's first half operating income was a record $15.2 million on $68 million of revenues. In 2011, operating income through June was $6.3 million and revenues were $58 million. The rail fleet has increased to approximately 23,100 cars from 22,400 last year. In addition, the Rail Group executed several transactions in the quarter that will result in the recognition of $4.3 million in operating income next quarter.
The Turf & Specialty Group had operating income of $2.8 million in the second quarter on $44 million of revenues. Last year, the group reported operating income of $1.8 million on $42 million of revenues for the same period. Through the first half of 2012, the group's operating income was $5.0 million on $89 million of revenues, which is similar to the prior year's result.
 
The Retail Group had an operating income of $1.4 million during the second quarter of 2012 on revenues of $44 million. During the same period of the prior year, the group had an operating income of $1.9 million and revenues were $45 million. Through the first six months, the group lost $1.3 million and revenues were $75 million. Last year through June, the group lost $0.8 million on revenues of $77 million.
We had a good quarter, although our expectations for the remainder of the year have been tempered by the drought conditions currently being experienced, which will certainly impact our grain and ethanol businesses, CEO Mike Anderson stated. Although the results of our Ethanol Group have declined, given the current ethanol margin environment, we feel the results demonstrate that our business structure, including co-products, services, and equity partners, perform much better in a down market than the general industry. I am particularly proud of the Rail Group's record results this quarter as well as PNG's strong results, which continue to demonstrate the portfolio benefits of our business mix added Mr. Anderson.

(a) Within 20 days following the Closing Date, BUYER, and SELLER, will prepare an unaudited Measurement Date consolidated balance sheet (the Closing Balance Sheet) and calculation of Working Capital Adjustment, pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.1(c) (the Working Capital Adjustment Statement). The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with its application in the preparation of the Interim Balance Sheet, except as otherwise required pursuant to this Agreement, while Working Capital Adjustment Statement shall be calculated in accordance with Sections 2.1(c) and 2.3. If BUYER and SELLER are unable to agree upon the Working Capital Adjustment Statement within such period, BUYER's version of such statement will be submitted to SELLER for review and resolution pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.4(b), (c) and (d).
(b) Upon receipt from BUYER, SELLER shall have 15 days to review the Working Capital Adjustment Statement (the Review Period). If SELLER disagrees with BUYER's computation of Working Capital Adjustment, SELLER may, on or prior to the last day of the Review Period, deliver a notice to BUYER (the Notice of Objection), which sets forth its objections to BUYER's calculation of Working Capital Adjustment;
provided
that
the Notice of Objection shall include only objections based on (i) non-compliance with the standards set forth in
Section 2.1(c)
for the determination of Working Capital Adjustment or disagreement with the valuations of the items described in
Section 2.3
, and
4
(ii) mathematical errors in the computation of Working Capital Adjustment. Any Notice of Objection shall specify those items or amounts with which SELLER disagrees, together with a detailed written explanation of the reasons for disagreement with each such item or amount, and shall set forth SELLER's calculation of Working Capital Adjustment based on such objections. To the extent not set forth in the Notice of Objection, SELLER shall be deemed to have agreed with BUYER's calculation of all other items and amounts contained in the Working Capital Adjustment Statement.
(c) Unless SELLER delivers the Notice of Objection to BUYER within the Review Period, SELLER shall be deemed to have accepted BUYER's calculation of Working Capital Adjustment and the Working Capital Adjustment Statement shall be final, conclusive and binding. If SELLER delivers the Notice of Objection to BUYER within the Review Period, SELLER and BUYER shall, during the 30 days following such delivery or any mutually agreed extension thereof, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items and amounts in order to determine the amount of Working Capital Adjustment. If, at the end of such period or any mutually agreed extension thereof, BUYER and SELLER are unable to resolve their disagreements, they shall jointly retain and refer their disagreements to an independent accounting firm of national reputation selected by the SELLER's and BUYER's respective independent certified public accountants or investment banking firms (the Independent Expert). The parties shall instruct the Independent Expert promptly to review
Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4
and to determine solely with respect to the disputed items and amounts so submitted whether and to what extent, if any, the Working Capital Adjustment set forth in the Working Capital Adjustment Statement requires adjustment. The Independent Expert shall base its determination solely on written submissions by BUYER and SELLER and not on an independent review. BUYER and SELLER shall make available to the Independent Expert all relevant books and records and other items reasonably requested by the Independent Expert. The parties shall request that the Independent Expert deliver to BUYER and SELLER, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than 45 days after its retention, a report which sets forth its resolution of the disputed items and amounts and its calculation of Working Capital Adjustment;
provided
that
in no event shall Working Capital Adjustment as determined by the Independent Expert be less than BUYER's calculation of Adjusted Working Capital set forth in the Working Capital Adjustment Statement nor more than SELLER's calculation of Working Capital Adjustment set forth in the Notice of Objection. The decision of the Independent Expert shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. The costs and expenses of the Independent Expert shall be allocated between the parties based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by such party. Each party agrees to execute, if requested by the Independent Expert, a reasonable engagement letter, including customary indemnities in favor of the Independent Expert.
(d) Final Working Capital Adjustment means the Working Capital Adjustment (i) shown in the Working Capital Adjustment Statement delivered by BUYER to SELLER pursuant to Section 2.4(a), if no Notice of Objection with respect thereto is timely delivered by SELLER to BUYER pursuant to Section 2.4(b); or (ii) if a Notice of Objection is so delivered, as determined pursuant to Section 2.4(c). If the Adjusted Working Capital as of the Interim Balance Sheet Date amount exceeds the Adjusted Working Capital as of the Measurement Date, SELLER shall pay to BUYER, in the manner and with interest as provided in Section 2.5, an amount of cash equal to such excess (the Excess Amount). If Adjusted Working Capital as of the Interim Balance Sheet Date is less than Adjusted Working Capital as of the Measurement Date , BUYER shall pay to SELLER, in the manner and with interest as provided in Section 2.5, an amount of cash equal to the amount of such deficiency (the Deficit Amount).
2.5. Settlement of Definitive Purchase Price.
5
(a) Within three Business Days after Final Adjusted Working Capital has been finally determined pursuant to Section 2.4(a)-(d): (i) if there is an Excess Amount, SELLER shall pay to BUYER an amount equal to such Excess Amount, together with interest calculated as set forth below, and (ii) if there is a Deficit Amount, BUYER shall pay to SELLER an amount equal to such Deficit Amount, together with interest calculated as set forth below. Any such payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by BUYER or SELLER, as the case may be, at least one Business Day prior to such transfer. The amount of any payment to be made pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the Prime Rate as published in
The Wall Street Journal
, in effect from time to time during the period from the Closing Date to the date of payment. Such interest shall be calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed, without compounding. If a portion of the Final Adjusted Working Capital amount is not in dispute, and is not being reviewed by the Independent Expert (the Non-Disputed Amount), then an amount equal to the excess of the Non-Disputed Amount over the amount in dispute shall be payable within three Business Days of the calculation thereof (for example, if the Non-Disputed Amount is $10,000, and the amount being disputed is $3,000, then $7,000 shall be payable within such 3 Business Day period, with the remaining non-disputed $3,000 being payable, or offset, when the disputed amount is resolved under Section 2.4.).
(b) Any rights accruing to a party under this Section 2.5 shall be in addition to and independent of the rights to indemnification under Article VIII.
2.6 Purchase Price Allocation
. The Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Purchased Assets (or groups of such assets) for tax purposes on the basis of the relative fair market values of such Purchased Assets (or groups of such assets) as of the Closing Date in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 1060 of the Code (the Purchase Price Allocation). On or before December 31, 2012, BUYER, at its expense, shall obtain third party appraisals of the tangible Purchased Assets and provide SELLER with written notice of the relative fair market values of the Purchased Assets (or groups of Purchased Assets). SELLER shall have the right to consent to such determination of fair market values, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If SELLER does not so consent and BUYER and SELLER are unable to resolve a dispute relating to the Purchase Price Allocation within 15 days after SELLER provides BUYER with written notice of dispute (or such longer period as SELLER and BUYER agree), then the determination of the Purchase Price Allocation shall be resolved by an independent third-party appraiser mutually selected by BUYER and SELLER, the cost of which shall be shared equally by SELLER and BUYER and the determination of which shall be final and binding on the Parties.

BUYER and SELLER acknowledge that after the Closing, BUYER and SELLER may have common customers who owe receivables to each of them. BUYER and SELLER shall each advise their common account obligor customers that their respective receivables are separate, and payments thereof should not be combined, nor should disputes by any customer with BUYER or SELLER be the basis of an attempted offset or deduction against a receivable owed to the other party. Payments made by a common customer to BUYER or SELLER shall be assumed to be made solely for the account owed to that party. Payments received in error by one party, as determined by the named payee on any check or payment directions specifying the party to be paid, shall be promptly delivered by BUYER or SELLER to the correct party, as applicable.
(b) BUYER shall, upon SELLER's request, attempt to collect SELLER's Receivables on behalf of SELLER. SELLER acknowledges that BUYER is making no representation, warranty, guaranty or assurance of any kind as to the collectability or timeliness of any Receivable payment, nor shall BUYER be responsible to contest any assertion of setoff, counterclaim, or any other defense by any account obligor of any Receivable. BUYER's obligation hereunder shall be to use its best efforts to submit invoices in the amounts claimed by SELLER, and to make follow-up contact with each account obligor to discuss payment, and to keep an accurate record of collections, and make timely repayment of collections to SELLER. BUYER shall be under no obligation to engage in any legal collection activity.

SELLER hereby represents and warrants to BUYER that each Receivable requested to be collected by BUYER is legal, valid and properly due and owing in the amount stated by SELLER, and to SELLER's knowledge, not subject to counterclaim, right of set-off or other defenses. If SELLER requests that BUYER collect a Receivable from a common account obligor of SELLER and BUYER, and such account obligor makes a single payment to BUYER in an amount insufficient to pay all then outstanding amounts owed to BUYER and SELLER, then BUYER and SELLER shall share such payment pro rata in accordance with the respective balances then due and owing to each of them by such common account obligor. In such event, BUYER shall provide its calculations of such allocation to SELLER with its payment to SELLER, which shall be binding upon the parties absent manifest error. SELLER shall promptly, within 2 days, advise BUYER of any payments SELLER may receive in respect of any Receivable which SELLER has requested BUYER to collect.
BUYER DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER EXPRESS AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES RELATING TO ANY COLLECTION SERVICES IT MAY PROVIDE, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.

SELLER agrees to provide such services unless SELLER concludes in good faith that it cannot provide such services without demonstrable undue hardship to SELLER. Transition Services will also include SELLER's retention of employees who are to be hired by BUYER and the leasing of such employees' services to BUYER for a temporary period to enable an orderly transition of benefits and other employment services. BUYER shall receive the Transition Services only for the benefit of the Business as transferred to BUYER pursuant to this Agreement. SELLER warrants that the Transition Services will be performed in substantially the same manner and contain substantially the same elements as when the Transition Services were provided to the Business as owned by SELLER prior to the Closing Date.

5.9 Post-Closing Inventory Deliveries. Pursuant to certain of the Assumed Contracts,BUYER shall undertake SELLER's Inventory delivery obligations to third party customers following the Closing Date. SELLER and BUYER shall cooperate in good faith to assure timely and complete performance of such delivery obligations.

. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no contracts, properties, rights or other assets of SELLER shall be deemed sold, transferred or assigned to BUYER pursuant to this Agreement if the attempted sale, transfer or assignment to BUYER without the consent or approval of another party or Governmental Entity would be ineffective or would constitute a breach of contract or a violation of any Law or would in any other way materially adversely affect the rights of SELLER (or BUYER as transferee or assignee) and such consent or approval is not obtained on or prior to the Closing Date. In such case, to the extent possible, (a) the beneficial interest in or to such contracts, properties, rights or other assets, to the extent the same would otherwise constitute Purchased Assets (collectively, the Beneficial Rights), shall in any event pass as of the Closing Date to BUYER under this Agreement, and (b) pending such consent or approval, BUYER shall assume and discharge the liabilities of SELLER under such Beneficial Rights, to the extent such obligations would otherwise constitute Assumed Liabilities, as agent for SELLER, and SELLER shall act as BUYER's agent in the receipt of any benefits, rights or interest received from the Beneficial Rights. BUYER and SELLER shall use their respective best efforts (and bear their respective costs of such efforts) to obtain and secure all consents and approvals that may be necessary to effect the legal and valid sale or transfer of the contracts, properties, rights or other assets underlying the Beneficial Rights. BUYER and SELLER shall make or complete such transfers as soon as reasonably possible and cooperate with each other in any other reasonable arrangement designed to provide BUYER with the Beneficial Rights and to provide for BUYER's discharge of any liability arising under the contracts, properties, rights or other assets underlying the Beneficial Rights to the extent such liability would otherwise constitute an Assumed Liability.
5.11
    
Further Assurances
. From time to time after the Closing Date, upon request of either Party and without further consideration, each Party shall execute and deliver to the requesting Party such documents and take such action as the requesting Party reasonably requests to consummate more effectively the intent and purpose of the Parties under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
5.12. Superior Proposal. From and after the date of this Agreement, SELLER shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its parent company or affiliate or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or representatives, directly or indirectly through another Person, to (i) solicit, initiate or encourage, or take any other action designed to, or to facilitate any inquiries with respect to or the making of any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Acquisition Proposal.

SELLER shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and request the prompt return or destruction of all Proprietary Information previously furnished.

provided,
that notice of such determination, and copies of or identical access to, all information provided to such Person, is promptly (and in any event within 48
19
hours of such determination) given to BUYER. BUYER shall have a right of first refusal to match any Superior Proposal within 15 days of receipt of written notice thereof from SELLER by issuing its written intention to do so, subject to the same terms and conditions provided in the Acquisition Proposal. If BUYER shall elect not to accept such Superior Proposal, but material changes are thereafter made to the Acquisition Proposal, such changes shall be communicated in writing to BUYER, who shall have a right of first refusal to accept such revised terms within 15 days of receipt of such notice.
Superior Proposal means an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made by a third party (other than one made in response to any solicitation by the GPRE or its officers, employees, directors, or representatives in violation of this Section) which the GPRE board determines in good faith, after consulting with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, and taking into account such facts as the GPRE board considers to be appropriate (including conditions to and expected timing and risks of consummation of such Acquisition Proposal and any break-up fees or expense reimbursement provisions), would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to the holders of GPRE common stock.

Neither the board of directors of GPRE nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or qualify or modify in any manner adverse to BUYER), or publicly propose to withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to BUYER), the approval, adoption or recommendation by the board of directors or any committee thereof of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) approve, adopt or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a GPRE Adverse Recommendation) or (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, or allow GPRE or any of its subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent,

memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar arrangement constituting or related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in this Section) (a GPRE Acquisition Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to Closing and subject to this Section 5.12, the board of directors of GPRE, in response to an Acquisition Proposal that the board of directors of GPRE determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors) constitutes a Superior Proposal that was unsolicited, made after the date of this Agreement, and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.12(a), may make a GPRE Adverse Recommendation;
provided, however
, that GPRE shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a GPRE Adverse Recommendation pursuant hereto if it is in breach of its obligations under this Section 5.12.
Nothing contained in this Section shall prohibit GPRE from (x) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or a statement required under Rule 14a-9 under the Exchange Act or (y) making any disclosure to the shareholders of GPRE that is required by applicable law;
provided, however
, that in no event shall GPRE or its board of directors or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by this Section (it being understood that any accurate disclosure of factual information to the shareholders of GPRE that is required to be made to such shareholders under applicable federal securities laws shall not be considered a modification prohibited by clause (i)(A) of this Section).

The Parties acknowledge that the amount of the Green Plains Termination Fee represents their negotiated agreement as to the amount thereof, in lieu of any actual or other damage claim, in law or in equity, to be asserted hereunder. The Parties also agree that such fee is intended to represent estimated actual damages and are not intended as a penalty.
5.14. Environmental Matters. (a) BUYER and SELLER have agreed to the performance of Phase I environmental assessments pursuant to ASTM E 1527-05 standards, to be performed by a third party environmental consultant jointly approved by them for the Facilities (although BUYER may be the sole contracting party on the environmental consultant's engagement contract), the cost of which shall be borne equally by the parties (the Phase I Assessments). BUYER and SELLER acknowledge that the Phase I Assessments are not yet completed as of the date of this Agreement, but are expected to be completed prior to the Closing Date.

The environmental consultant will be instructed to explicitly recommend, or not recommend, the commission of a Phase II environmental assessment. If, within 15 days of receipt of the Phase I Assessments, BUYER and SELLER are unable to agree on the necessity or scope of any Phase II environmental assessment, the environmental consultant (or, if such environmental consultant is unwilling to perform such service, another environmental consultant agreed by BUYER and SELLER) will make such determination, whose determination will be binding upon the Parties. The cost of any such Phase II environmental assessment shall be borne equally by BUYER and SELLER.
(c) If the Phase II assessment shall confirm the presence of a Recognized Environmental Condition, SELLER shall cause, at SELLER's expense, after BUYER has incurred the first $250,000 of remediation expense, the remediation thereof to commercially reasonable and recognized standards under relevant state or federal standards
as promptly as practicable, up to a total cap of SELLER's remediation expense of $2,000,000. The environmental consultant will be instructed to explicitly state whether a Recognized Environmental Condition is, or is not, present, and if so, to present the specific remediation method and standards to be applied, or the process by which an appropriate remediation method and standards shall be determined. (or, if such environmental consultant is unwilling to perform such service, another environmental consultant agreed by BUYER and SELLER) If such remediation shall occur after the Closing Date, BUYER shall provide reasonable access to SELLER and its contractors to perform such remediation work, subject to commercially reasonable requirements for bonding, safety, mechanics lien protection, and like provisions customary for projects of this nature.

The Andersons Signs Agreement to Purchase 12 Grain Elevators and
Two Farm Agronomy Centers from Green Plains Grain Company
MAUMEE, OHIO, October 29, 2012 - The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE) announces today it has signed an agreement to purchase substantially all of the grain and agronomy assets of Green Plains Grain Company, LLC, a subsidiary of Green Plains Renewable Energy, Inc. (Nasdaq: GPRE) The transaction, which remains subject to certain customary closing conditions, is expected to close in the fourth quarter.
This will be the largest acquisition in our company's 65 year history, and will increase the storage capacity of our Grain Group by nearly 30 percent, says CEO Mike Anderson. This acquisition aligns with our geographic growth strategy for both our grain and plant nutrient businesses and we expect it will be accretive on a full-year basis in 2013.
The agreement involves the purchase of seven facilities in Iowa and five in Tennessee, with a combined grain storage capacity of about 32 million bushels, 12,000 tons of nutrient storage and more than 130 employees and working capital.
This acquisition is consistent with our strategy of expanding our footprint into high grain production geographies where we can leverage our core capabilities to serve more customers in diverse trade areas. It enables us to push further to the west and south, increasing our presence in Iowa and entering Tennessee, says Denny Addis, President, Grain Group. An additional benefit is our ability to now offer agronomy services in a combined manner with our grain business.
Stephens Inc. is acting as financial advisor to The Andersons and has delivered a fairness opinion to the Board of Directors in connection with the transaction.
The Andersons will host a webcast on Wednesday, Oct. 31, 2012 at 10:00 a.m. ET, to discuss this potential acquisition. The webcast can be accessed under the heading "Investor" on its website at

THE ANDERSONS, INC. REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
Third Quarter Earnings of $0.90 per Diluted Share
Rail Group Leads Earning Results
MAUMEE, OHIO, November 5, 2012-The Andersons, Inc. (NASDAQ: ANDE)
today announced third quarter net income attributable to the company of $16.9 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.1 billion. In the third quarter of 2011, the company reported results of $10.9 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, on revenues of $939 million. For the first nine months of 2012, the company earned $64.5 million, or $3.43 per diluted share, on revenues of $3.6 billion. In the same period of 2011, The Andersons reported results of $73.4 million, or $3.92 per diluted share, on $3.3 billion of revenues.
The Rail Group achieved record third quarter operating income of $19.1 million on revenues of $60 million. In the same three month period of 2011, the group earned $1.1 million and revenues were $24 million. This quarter, the group recognized $13.5 million in gains on sales of railcars and related leases and non-recourse transactions (where the company continues to provide car management services to the purchaser and typically holds an option to purchase the railcars at the end of the assigned lease). In the third quarter of 2011, the company recognized a gain on similar transactions of $0.7 million. Gross profit from the leasing business was significantly higher due primarily to an increase in the average lease rate. The average utilization rate for the quarter was approximately 84 percent, which is down slightly from 85 percent last year. The rail fleet has increased to approximately 23,400 cars from 22,300 last year. The group's first nine months operating income was $34.3 million on $128 million of revenues. In 2011, operating income through September was $7.4 million and revenues were $82 million. These results include gains similar to those aforementioned of $22.2 million and $7.7 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
The Grain Group had operating income of $10.8 million in the third quarter of 2012 versus $8.3 million for the same period last year. The group benefited from an early harvest, which resulted in higher gross profit on sales in comparison to the prior year third quarter. Space income was down considerably, as expected. This was offset by record third quarter earnings from the company's investment in Lansing Trade Group. Revenues for the Grain Group were $677 million and $539 million for the third quarter of 2012 and 2011, respectively. Revenues increased primarily due to an increase in the bushels sold. The Grain Group's operating income for the first nine months of the year was $45.5 million on revenues of $2.1 billion. Last year, its operating income through September was $60.0 million on revenues of $2.0 billion. As announced last week, the group has entered into an agreement to purchase the majority of the grain and agronomy assets of Green Plains Grain Company, LLC, a subsidiary of Green Plains Renewable Energy, Inc. This acquisition includes seven facilities in Iowa and five in Tennessee, with a combined grain storage capacity of approximately 32 million bushels, which increases the group's storage capacity by nearly 30 percent. The Iowa locations also have 30 thousand tons of fertilizer storage space.
The Plant Nutrient Group's third quarter operating income was $0.8 million on revenues of $135 million. In the same three month period of 2011, the group had operating income of $6.6 million on revenues of $138 million. Margins in the third quarter were solid; however, in the prior year margins were significantly higher. The group's first nine months' operating income was $34.5 million on $619 million of revenues. Last year, its operating income through September was $35.8 million on revenues of $521 million. Increased revenues this year are due to both increased volume and higher selling prices.
The Ethanol Group had an operating loss of $0.9 million in the third quarter, compared to earnings of $4.4 million during the same period last year. The loss was primarily the result of a decrease in the company's earnings from its ethanol investment affiliates, whose income continues to be significantly impacted by lower ethanol margins that have resulted from increased corn costs and lower ethanol demand. Partially offsetting the group's lower margins are service income and income from co-products such as corn-oil, DDGs, E-85, and CO2.
Total revenues for the quarter in 2012 and 2011 were $210 million and $179 million, respectively. Revenues were up due to the addition of the Denison, Iowa facility in May. The group's operating loss through September was $2.9 million on revenues of $528 million. Last year, its nine month operating income was $16.8 million on revenues of $477 million.
The Turf & Specialty Group had an operating loss of $1.6 million in the third quarter on $22 million of revenues. Last year, the group reported an operating loss of $1.2 million on $23 million of revenues for the same period. Through the first nine months of 2012, the group's operating income was $3.4 million on $110 million of revenues. Last year, its operating income was $3.8 million for the same period on revenues of $112 million.
The Retail Group had an operating loss of $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2012 on revenues of $35 million. In the comparable period last year, the group's operating loss was $1.2 million and total revenues were $36 million. Through nine months, the group recorded a loss of $3.1 million and total revenues of $110 million. Last year through September the group lost $2.0 million on total revenues of $112 million.
We had a great quarter, due in a large part to the exceptional results seen in our Rail Group, which has had record results every quarter this year due to skillful management of its railcar assets, CEO Mike Anderson stated. We also had good results in the Grain Group, although some of its income has been accelerated due to the early harvest. The Grain Group's performance was impacted by record Lansing Trade Group earnings, added Mr. Anderson. Our expectations for the remainder of the year still remain tempered by the drought, which will continue to impact our grain and ethanol businesses through the first half of 2013. Our recent acquisitions and capital expansions, however, will pay dividends in the future. These include the acquisition of Mt. Pulaski Products, which was finalized last week, breaking ground on a new, state of the art, railcar blast and paint facility, the recent opening of our Anselmo, Nebraska grain elevator, and the previously mentioned Green Plains Grain Company, LLC acquisition. We will effectively manage through the 2012 drought, as we have to date, and will continue our focus on long term earnings growth, concluded Mr. Anderson.

FIRST AMENDMENT TO ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT
THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT
(this 
Amendment
) is made and effective as of November 30, 2012 between Green Plains Grain Company LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and Green Plains Grain Company TN LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, (each individually, and collectively as the context may require, 
SELLER
), Green Plains Renewable Energy, Inc. (GPRE) and The Andersons, Inc., an Ohio corporation (
BUYER
).
WHEREAS,
SELLER, BUYER and GPRE are parties to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of October 26 (the Agreement) which the Parties have agreed to amend to provide for the purchase by BUYER of the SELLER's accounts receivable pursuant to this Amendment.
NOW, THEREFORE,
in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement, SELLER, GPRE and BUYER agree that the Agreement is hereby amended as follows (capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings provided in the Agreement):
(j) all Receivables (excluding any intercompany receivables among SELLER, GPRE and their affiliates); and
(vi) the unpaid balance of all Receivables; and
The Receivables are due and owing in their entirety, and are not subject to any discount, rebate, counterclaim, diminution, offset or other claim which may grant the account obligors thereof any legal right to pay less than the outstanding balance thereof reflected in Schedule 3.1(t), except by operation of bankruptcy and insolvency laws for the protection of debtors. All Receivables will be paid in full by the account obligor not later than 150 days following the Closing Date.
5.5 Receivables. (a) As provided in Section 1.2, BUYER is acquiring SELLER's Receivables pursuant to this Agreement for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance thereof as of the Closing Date, less an amount equal to the product of such outstanding balance multiplied by a percentage equal to four (4.0) percent multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is 30 and the denominator of which is 365. Any Receivable not paid in full by the account obligor thereunder to BUYER within 150 days following the Closing Date (the Repurchase Date) shall be repurchased by SELLER from BUYER for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance thereof on the Repurchase Date. Within 15 days following the Repurchase Date, BUYER will submit to SELLER written notice of the outstanding balance of any unpaid Receivables as of the Repurchase Date, together with a detailed accounting of the collection history of such account obligor with BUYER showing the calculation used to determine such unpaid balance (the Receivables Notice). If SELLER shall dispute the calculations presented in the Receivables Notice, SELLER shall submit a Notice of Objection relating thereto in writing to BUYER within 15 days of its receipt thereof. SELLER shall pay the purchase price to
BUYER and BUYER shall transfer all right to the undisputed outstanding balance of the Receivables to SELLER 30 days following the Repurchase Date, unless the dispute resolution provisions provided in the next sentence shall apply in which event such payment and transfer shall occur 3 days following such resolution. The provisions of Sections 2.4(b) and 2.4(c) with respect to the resolution of disputes shall be applied to resolve any dispute reflected in such Notice of Objection.
(b) If BUYER shall have generated additional receivables after the Closing Date from any party who shall also be an account obligor of any Receivable, payments received from such party shall first be applied to any outstanding obligation specifically designated in writing by such party. All other payments received from such party shall be applied first, in date order, to the Receivables and then to any such additional receivables generated by BUYER unless the account obligor of any Receivable shall have indicated in writing its disagreement with the amount thereof, or alleges the existence of any counterclaim, offset or other reduction applicable against such Receivable, in which event the payments received from such account obligor (unless the first sentence of this clause (b) shall apply) shall be applied, in date order, to all other uncontested Receivables of such account obligor and then to any such additional receivables of such account obligor generated by BUYER.
(c) BUYER shall provide an invoice to the account obligor at least once per month prior to the Repurchase Date and shall otherwise attempt to follow SELLER's collection practices to the extent consistent with BUYER's own collection practices, provided, however, anything in the foregoing portion of this sentence to the contrary notwithstanding: (i) BUYER shall have no obligation to commence any legal process, including the initiation of any civil lawsuit, the filing of any criminal complaint, foreclosure upon any collateral, commencement of any involuntary bankruptcy or receivership petition, (ii) BUYER shall have no obligation to incur any out of pocket expenses or unreasonable internal expenses in connection therewith, and (iii) BUYER shall have no obligation to engage in any activity which, in the opinion of BUYER's counsel, shall subject BUYER to any risk of legal liability (items (i) through (iii) collectively referred to as Formal Collection Processes). BUYER shall provide to SELLER a listing of all unpaid Receivables on a monthly basis and inform SELLER of any assertion by any account obligor with respect to a Receivable as to defense or counterclaim to the payment thereof and shall reasonably cooperate with SELLER, at SELLER's expense, in jointly pursuing collection of the account. In the event BUYER chooses not to commence any Formal Collection Process requested by SELLER in conjunction with nonpayment or any defense or counterclaim with respect to an obligor, SELLER may repurchase the Receivable at that time and pursue any collection method it determines to be appropriate.
(d) SELLER shall, in cooperation with BUYER, promptly following the Closing Date, advise the account obligors of the sale of the Receivables, and shall direct such account obligors to make all future payments to such address or lockbox as BUYER shall designate. Payments received following the Closing Date by SELLER in respect of any Receivable shall be promptly delivered by SELLER to BUYER. BUYER shall deliver to SELLER any checks or instruments received by BUYER but bearing SELLER's name and SELLER shall thereupon endorse such checks or instruments to BUYER for deposit within 3 days of receipt thereof unless SELLER shall have determined that such check or instrument is a payment of another obligation owed by such account obligor which is not a Receivable. Any such checks or instruments which are not endorsed by SELLER shall not be applied to any Receivable which shall remain unpaid and subject to SELLER's repurchase obligation hereunder. SELLER shall provide a detailed accounting of the other obligation which SELLER asserts is the intended account to be paid. Nothing herein shall be construed to waive or release BUYER's right to assert that any such check or instrument was an intended payment to BUYER for a receivable generated by BUYER but erroneously made out to SELLER.
6. Section 8.1 is amended by adding the follow as clause (c) thereto:
(c) If the Closing occurs, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Article 8, in addition to the indemnification provided in Section 8.1(a) and (b), SELLER and GPRE shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless BUYER and its Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees and controlling persons, from and against all Losses asserted against or incurred by any such entity or person as a result of any: (i) breach as of the Closing Date of the representations and warranties of SELLER contained in Section
3.1(t) of this Agreement (but not in duplication of any ; and (ii) breach of the covenants of SELLER contained in Section 5.5 of this Agreement. All such indemnified representations and warranties of the parties shall survive the Closing Date for a period of eighteen months. All Losses described in this Section 8.1(c) shall be indemnified in full, without deductible, or minimum or maximum amount. Amounts paid in respect of any Receivable by any account obligor which are rescinded or returned by operation of any bankruptcy, insolvency or other law for the protection of creditors shall be added to, and regarded as, Losses for purposes of this indemnification. No claim or payment made pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) shall be applied or credited against, or otherwise serve to reduce, the minimum or maximum indemnification obligations provided in Section 8.1(a) and (b). In determining the amount of any Losses in respect of the breach of any representation or warranty for purposes of this Section 8.1(c) only (but not for determining whether there has been a breach), any representation or warranty that is qualified in scope as to materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifications shall be deemed to be made or given without such qualification, except where any such representation or warranty requires disclosure of lists or items of a material nature or above a specified threshold.
7. The terms and conditions of the Agreement, except to the extent specifically amended in this Amendment, are hereby ratified and confirmed, and shall be construed and interpreted in manner consistent with this Amendment as the context may require.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF,
the Parties have caused their duly authorized officers to execute and deliver this Asset Purchase Agreement as of the day and year first written above.

THE ANDERSONS, INC. REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER & FULL YEAR RESULTS
Full Year Earnings of $4.23 per Diluted Share
Rail and Plant Nutrient Groups set New Records
MAUMEE, OHIO, February 6, 2013-The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE),
today announced net income attributable to the company of $79.5 million, or $4.23 per diluted share, on revenues of $5.3 billion. The company had a strong year, surpassed only by the prior year in which it earned $95.1 million, or $5.09 per diluted share, on revenues of $4.6 billion. The company earned $15.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, or $0.80 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.7 billion. In the same three month period of 2011, the company reported net income of $21.7 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.3 billion. The majority of the year to year revenue increase relates to rising volume and prices, and growth, in the agricultural businesses.
The Rail Group achieved record operating income of $42.8 million in 2012, a significant improvement over its $9.8 million 2011 operating income. Gross profit from the leasing business was significantly higher than the prior year due mainly to higher lease rates, as overall utilization rate for both years was consistent at 84.6 percent. The group recognized $23.7 million in pre-tax gains on sales of railcars and related leases and non-recourse transactions (where the company continues to provide car management services to the purchaser and typically holds an option to purchase the railcars at the end of the assigned lease). In 2011, the company recognized gains of $8.4 million on similar transactions. Revenues of $156 million for 2012 were higher than the $107 million reported in the prior year due mainly to increased car sales and higher lease rates. The rail fleet increased by over 600 cars in 2012, to approximately 23,300 cars. The Rail Group had operating income of $8.6 million in the fourth quarter on revenues of $29 million. In 2011, operating income for the same three month period was $2.3 million on revenues of $25 million. These results include gains on sales of railcars and related leases and non-recourse transactions of $1.5 million and $0.7 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
The Plant Nutrient Group had record operating income of $39.3 million in 2012, surpassing 2011 earnings by $1.0 million. Revenues for 2012 and 2011 were $797 million and $691 million, respectively. While margins declined in 2012, both income and revenues increased due to higher volume. For the fourth quarter, the group's operating income was $4.7 million on $178 million of revenues. Last year the group had operating income of $2.5 million during the same three month period on revenues of $170 million. Increased operating income in the quarter was due to higher volume as favorable weather patterns increased nutrient application.
The Grain Group's 2012 operating income was $63.6 million, compared to operating income of $87.3 million in the prior year. The group had considerably lower space income in 2012, as a result of the drought, but an increase in bushels sold. In 2011, the group benefited from significant escalation in wheat basis. Lansing Trade Group contributed strongly to the Grain Group's result with its best ever annual performance. Total revenues for the Grain Group were $3.3 billion and $2.8 billion in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Revenues increased due to greater sales volume and higher grain prices. For the fourth quarter, the group's operating income was $18.1 million on revenues of $1.2 billion. In the same three month period of 2011, the group had operating income of $27.3 million on revenues of $876 million. The group acquired the majority of the Green Plains Grain Company assets, on December 3, 2012. The acquisition included seven facilities in Iowa and five in Tennessee, with grain storage capacity of approximately 32 million bushels. The Grain Group's storage capacity increased nearly 30 percent, and 30,000 tons of fertilizer storage was added as well.
The Ethanol Group had an operating loss of $3.7 million in 2012, compared to operating income of $23.3 million in the prior year. The operating income decline was due to significantly lower ethanol margins resulting from weak gasoline demand, an oversupply of ethanol, and high corn costs caused by last year's drought. The ethanol plants, however, continue to benefit from co-product sales of corn oil, E-85, Distillers Dried Grains and CO2. Total 2012 revenues were $743 million, up from $642 million in 2011. Revenues increased due to an increase in volume, the majority of which was due to the addition of the Denison, Iowa, facility in 2012. The group's fourth quarter operating loss was $0.8 million on revenues of $215 million. During the same three month period of 2011, operating income was $6.5 million on revenues of $165 million.
The Turf & Specialty Group's full year operating income was $2.2 million on revenues of $131 million. In 2011, the group had operating income of $2.0 million, and total revenues were $130 million. The group incurred an operating loss of $1.2 million in the fourth quarter on revenues of $21 million. Last year, operating loss for the same period was $1.8 million on revenues of $18 million. During the quarter, the group acquired the Mt. Pulaski cob business, which approximately doubled the production capacity of the Cob Division.
The Retail Group had an operating loss of $4.0 million in 2012, which included charges associated with closing its Woodville store. In the prior year, the group's operating loss was $1.5 million. Total 2012 sales for the group were $151 million, compared to sales of $158 million in the prior year. The Retail Group's fourth quarter operating income was a loss of $0.9 million on revenues of $41 million. Last year, during the same three month period, the group's operating income was $0.5 million and total revenues were $45 million.
This is definitely one of those years where our purposeful diversification paid off, CEO Mike Anderson stated. The Rail Group had its best year ever, due to skillful management of its railcar portfolio. Similarly, our Plant Nutrient Group had its second record year in a row even though margins decreased, as they increased sales volume and prudently managed their inventory. Our Grain Group also had good results, in part due to the record earnings of Lansing Trade Group, even though there were unfavorable impacts caused by the drought, Mr. Anderson added. In the last year we demonstrated our commitment to growth by acquiring New Eezy Grow, Inc., Denison, Mt. Pulaski, and the majority of the assets of the Green Plains Grain Company. We also opened our Anselmo, Nebraska grain elevator in August and look forward to opening a new railcar blast and paint facility this spring. As we have in the past, we will continue to focus on long term earnings growth.

THE ANDERSONS, INC. REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
First Quarter Earnings of $0.67 per Diluted Share
Rail Group Leads Earning Results
MAUMEE, OHIO, MAY 7, 2013 The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE)
announced first quarter net income attributable to the company of $12.6 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.3 billion. In the same three month period of 2012, the company reported results of $18.4 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, on $1.1 billion of revenues.
The Rail Group had record first quarter operating income of $14.6 million on revenues of $46 million. In the same three month period of 2012, the group earned $8.0 million and revenues were $36 million. The group's revenue and income benefited from higher lease rates and increased income from car financings. The group recognized $9.3 million in pre-tax gains on sales of railcars and related leases and non-recourse transactions. In 2012, the company recognized gains of $6.3 million on similar transactions. The average utilization rate for the quarter was 84.6 percent in comparison to 85.7 percent for the same period last year. The rail fleet has increased by more than 500 cars during the past year to 23,508 cars.
The Grain Group reported first quarter operating income of $8.3 million in 2013 in comparison to $19.4 million for the same period of the prior year. The Grain Group had considerably lower space income this quarter as inventories have declined as a result of the 2012 drought and market carry was much lower than the previous year. The group, however, benefited from record earnings from its investment in Lansing Trade Group. First quarter revenues for the Grain Group were $836 million and $700 million for 2013 and 2012, respectively. Revenues increased due to higher grain prices and greater sales volume, which resulted primarily from the addition of the former Green Plains Grain facilities.
The Ethanol Group had operating income of $2.5 million in the first quarter. This compares to $0.1 million earned during the same period of 2012. The higher income is the result of improved ethanol margins and increased co-product income. The sale of co-products such as corn oil, E-85, Distillers Dried Grains and CO2 remains a focus of the group as it contributes to a more consistent income base. Total revenues for the quarter were $199 million. In comparison, the group's revenues for the same period last year were $151 million. The revenue increase is primarily due to the added volume from the Denison, Iowa plant, which was acquired in the second quarter of 2012.
The Plant Nutrient Group had an operating loss of $0.6 million during the first quarter on revenues of $112 million. In the same three month period of 2012, the group reported operating income of $5.8 million and revenues of $175 million. The lower revenue and income were primarily due to weather related delays in fieldwork that led to approximately a one-third decrease in volume; this volume has likely been shifted to the second quarter. Margins from year to year are down slightly due to a very slow start to the season and limited inventory price appreciation.
The Turf & Specialty Group achieved record operating income of $4.0 million on $47 million of revenues during the first quarter. Last year, the group reported $2.2 million of operating income on $45 million of revenues for the period. Margin for the lawn business increased; and the increase more than offsets the decrease in volume from the prior year first quarter. Process improvements made in the lawn business last year are resulting in operational efficiencies.
The Retail Group had an operating loss of $3.2 million during the first quarter, which included $0.8 million of costs associated with the closing of the Woodville, Ohio store. In the prior year, the group's operating loss for the same three month period was $2.7 million. Revenues for the quarter were comparable at $31 million and $30 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Our Rail Group continues to perform well, as they skillfully manage their railcar portfolio. We are pleased with the continued strong performance of Lansing Trade Group and improved margins in the ethanol business, CEO Mike Anderson stated.
The 2012 drought, however, continues to impact our profitability. As we have mentioned before, this will continue to impact our grain and ethanol businesses this year. While the Plant Nutrient Group was impacted by adverse weather in the first quarter, they should benefit from an anticipated record corn crop planting in the second quarter, as long as the weather cooperates, added Mr. Anderson.

NEWS RELEASE
The Andersons and Lansing Trade Group to Acquire Canadian Entity
MAUMEE, OHIO, and OVERLAND PARK, KANSAS, June 3, 2013 - The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE) and Lansing Trade Group, LLC announce today they have entered into an agreement to acquire Thompsons Limited, a grain and food-grade bean handler and agronomy input provider, headquartered in Blenheim, Ontario, and operating through 12 locations across the province and in Minnesota.
The acquisition, which remains subject to certain customary closing conditions, is expected to close at the beginning of the third quarter. The business, which Lansing Trade Group and The Andersons will equally own, will continue to operate as Thompsons Limited. Lansing Trade Group's current trading office located in Chatham, Ontario will be consolidated into Thompsons.
For The Andersons, this acquisition establishes a foothold in Ontario with a similarly diversified agricultural company adjacent to our eastern corn-belt roots. It also enables us to leverage our strengths with those of our partner Lansing Trade Group, says CEO Mike Anderson. Thompsons is a highly respected, integrated grain, food-grade bean and agronomy business with a similar strategy of cultivating and maintaining strong relationships with growers and end users globally.
Thompsons Limited has always been a respected name in the Ontario agriculture markets, says Bill Krueger, President and CEO of Lansing Trade Group. The opportunity for Lansing to grow our existing Canadian presence with such a cornerstone company fits our long term strategy. Our partnership with The Andersons will facilitate the entity's immediate growth in the crop nutrients sector. Thompsons Limited will benefit from the combined strength of Lansing and The Andersons in its other areas of business including grains, food-grade products and farm services.
Established in 1924, Thompsons is an integrated supplier of value-added agricultural products and services to growers in Ontario, Minnesota and North Dakota and to food processing customers worldwide. Thompsons owns and operates 12 elevators, 11 retail farm centers, 2 seed processing plants, 5 bean processing plants and a wheat processing plant. Thompsons has a combined owned and leased grain storage capacity of 20 million bushels and 30,000 metric tons of nutrient capacity.
