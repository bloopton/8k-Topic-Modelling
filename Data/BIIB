Exhibit 99.1
San Diego, California (September 5, 2002)IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Nasdaq: IDPH) today announced that it has completed a preliminary review of the clinical results of its two Phase II clinical trials of IDEC-114 for patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, and that the data did not support further development in this indication.
"The data indicated that while IDEC-114 was well-tolerated at the dose levels administered, the level of clinical efficacy seen did not support further study in psoriasis," said Paul Grint, M.D., Chief Medical Officer. "However, we are encouraged by the safety profile of this antibody, and are actively evaluating other immunologic disorders for Phase II clinical testing. We will focus on diseases where the immunopathology is mediated by CD4 cells rather than CD8 cells, which are known to be dependent for their activation on the pathway being blocked by IDEC-114," added Dr. Grint.
It is IDEC's intent to present detailed results from these studies at a future peer review venue. In the meantime, the development of IDEC-114 in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) continues as planned. IDEC is completing a Phase I, single-agent, multiple-dose trial of IDEC-114 in relapsed NHL and plans to begin accrual in a Phase I/II combination trial with Rituxan in relapsed low grade NHL.
IDEC-114 is a PRIMATIZED anti-CD80 (anti-B7-1) monoclonal antibody that selectively targets an important co-stimulatory molecule on antigen-presenting cells. The antibody inhibits the binding of the B7-1 ligand on antigen-presenting cells to the CD28 receptor on T cells, thus blocking the second signal for inflammatory T-cell activation. Inappropriately activated T cells are implicated in many autoimmune disorders, making IDEC-114 potentially useful in a wide variety of disease states.
IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation is a leader in the discovery, development, and commercialization of targeted immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. IDEC discovered and developed the first monoclonal antibody product (Rituxan) and the first radioimmunotherapy product (Zevalin) approved in the United States for the treatment of cancer. IDEC is a San Diego based, integrated biopharmaceutical company with multiple products in clinical stage development and strategic alliances in a variety of research platforms. For a menu of IDEC's current news releases and quarterly reports or to retrieve a specific release, call (888) 329-2309.
The statements made in this press release contain certain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events or results may differ from IDEC's expectations. For example, the timing, success and cost of preclinical research and clinical studies, the timing, acceptability and review periods for regulatory filings, the timing of and ability to obtain regulatory approval of products, the achievement of future product sales, the level of manufacturing performance and the risk factors listed from time to time in IDEC's SEC filings including but not limited to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001 and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2002, may affect the actual results achieved by IDEC. These forward-looking statements represent the company's judgment as of the date of this release. The company disclaims, however, any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
IDEC Pharmaceuticals and Rituxan are registered U.S. trademarks of the company. Zevalin is a trademark of the company. The company's headquarters are located at 3030 Callan Road, San Diego, CA 92121.

Dated: April 15, 2003
 
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Nasdaq: IDPH) today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2003.  Total revenues for the first quarter ended March 31, 2003 were $117.2 million, compared to $79.7 million for the first quarter of 2002. Net income was $41.2 million, or $0.24 per share on a diluted basis, compared to $29.7 million, or $0.17 per share on a diluted basis, for the same period in 2002.
SAN DIEGO, California, (April 15, 2003):
 
Revenues for the first quarter of 2003 included $110.9 million recorded for IDEC's joint business arrangement with Genentech, Inc. for the commercialization of Rituxan (Rituximab), which IDEC copromotes in the U.S. with Genentech, compared to $78.2 million for the first quarter of 2002. Revenues in the first quarter of 2003 also included $5.7 million in U.S. net sales of Zevalin (ibritumomab tiuxetan) which IDEC markets alone in the U.S. and was launched in April 2002.
 
Rituxan Revenues
 
U.S. net sales of Rituxan in the first quarter of 2003, as recorded by Genentech, were $310 million compared to $235 million for the same period in 2002.
 
"Rituxan sales continue to drive growth in earnings," said William R. Rohn, IDEC's president and chief operating officer. "Net U.S. sales increased $75 million in the first quarter, representing a 32 percent increase from the same quarter last year."
 
Worldwide net sales of Rituxan during the first quarter of 2003 of $341 million, as reported by Genentech, included $31 million of ex-US sales to its partners F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. and Zenyaku Kogyo Co. Ltd. of Japan. IDEC's royalty revenue on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. is based on Roche's and Zenyaku's end-user sales and is recorded with a one-quarter lag. IDEC recognized, during the first quarter of 2003, $14.7 million in royalties from Roche's and Zenyaku's end-user sales during the fourth quarter of 2002.
 
Revenues from unconsolidated joint business reflect the financial results from the commercialization of Rituxan by IDEC and Genentech. Revenues from unconsolidated joint business includes various revenues associated with Rituxan commercialization such as IDEC's share of the pretax copromotion profits, reimbursements from Genentech for IDEC's Rituxan-related sales force and development expenses, and royalty revenues on sales of Rituximab outside the United States by Roche and Zenyaku.  Roche has marketing rights to Rituximab outside of the U.S., and copromotes Rituxan in Japan with Zenyaku.
 
IDEC's share of copromotion profits is received in two tiers, a lower tier that resets annually at the beginning of each year and a higher tier that applies once a certain copromotion profit level is met. IDEC's profit-sharing formula was reset to the lower tier on January 1, 2003. The profit-sharing formula increased to the higher tier in January 2003 when the annual fixed copromotion profit level was achieved.
 
Operating Costs and Expenses
 
Operating costs and expenses for the first quarter of 2003 increased to $54.1 million from $38.1 million for the first quarter of 2002. The higher 2003 operating expenses are primarily the result of increased sales and marketing expenses to support commercialization of Zevalin, increased research and development expenses resulting from the expansion of our product development pipeline, and increased personnel, facility and insurance expenses.
 
Cash Position
 
IDEC ended the first quarter of 2003 with cash, cash equivalents and securities available-for-sale totaling $1.5 billion.
 
General Information
 
IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation is a leader in the discovery, development, and commercialization of targeted immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. IDEC discovered and developed the first commercially available radioimmunotherapy product (Zevalin) approved in the United States, which is used to treat certain non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.  IDEC also discovered and, with co-promotion partner Genentech, Inc., developed the first monoclonal antibody product (Rituxan) approved in the United States for the treatment of cancer. Rituxan is approved in over 70 countries worldwide and is also used to treat various types of non-Hodgkin's lyphomas.  IDEC is a San Diego based, integrated biopharmaceutical company with multiple products in clinical stage development and strategic alliances in a variety of research platforms.

For example, the risk factors listed from time to time in IDEC's SEC filings including but not limited to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 may affect the actual results achieved by IDEC.

Item 5.    Other Events
        On Monday, June 23, 2003, IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation ("IDEC") and Biogen, Inc. ("Biogen") announced that they have signed a merger agreement (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which IDEC will combine with Biogen in an all-stock transaction (the "Transaction"). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, IDEC will issue Biogen stockholders 1.15 shares of IDEC common stock for each outstanding share of Biogen common stock. Upon completion of the Transaction, IDEC stockholders will own 50.5% of the combined company and Biogen stockholders will own 49.5% of the combined company. Completion of the Transaction is subject to approval by the stockholders of both companies, as well as regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. The parties anticipate that the Transaction will be completed in the late third quarter or early fourth quarter of 2003. A copy of the joint press release announcing the Transaction is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Exhibit 2.1 to this Form 8-K. The joint press release includes an overview of the material terms of the Transaction and descriptions of the companies. IDEC intends to file a registration statement on Form S-4 to register the shares of IDEC common stock to be issued in the Transaction.
        In connection with the Transaction, IDEC has entered into an amendment (the "Rights Agreement Amendment") to its Amended and Restated Rights Agreement dated as of July 26, 2001 (the "Rights Agreement"). A copy of the amendment is attached as Exhibit 4.1 to this Form 8-K. A copy of the Rights Agreement is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to IDEC's Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on July 27, 2001. The Rights Agreement Amendment clarifies that, prior to the effectiveness of the Transaction, holders of Biogen common stock will not be deemed to beneficially own shares of IDEC common stock issuable in connection with the Transaction (under the Rights Agreement, in general, the rights will become exercisable if a person acquires more than a certain percentage of beneficial ownership of IDEC's then outstanding common stock).
        The foregoing summary of the Transaction and the Merger Agreement is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the Merger Agreement and the above-referenced joint press release, attached to this Form 8-K as Exhibits 2.1 and 99.1, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing summary of the Rights Agreement Amendment and the Rights Agreement is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the Rights Agreement Amendment, attached to this Form 8-K as Exhibit 4.1 and incorporated herein by reference, and the Rights Agreement, attached as Exhibit 4.1 to IDEC's Form 8-K filed July 27, 2001 and incorporated herein by reference.

        SECTION 2.2

        (a)
    Exchange Agent.
    At or prior to the Effective Time, IDEC shall engage an institution reasonably satisfactory to Biogen to act as exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the "
Exchange Agent
"), pursuant to an agreement reasonably satisfactory to Biogen. At the Effective Time, IDEC shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of Biogen Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, certificates representing the shares of IDEC Common Stock issuable pursuant to
Section 2.1(a)
. In addition, IDEC shall make available by depositing with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time after the Effective Time as needed, cash in an amount sufficient to make the payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.1(e)
and any dividends or distributions to which holders of shares of Biogen Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2(c)
. All cash and IDEC Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "
Exchange Fund
."
        (b)
    Exchange Procedures.
    Promptly after the Effective Time, IDEC shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Biogen Common Stock (the "
Certificates
"), which at the Effective Time were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.1
hereof, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as IDEC may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing whole shares of IDEC Common Stock,
cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.1(e)
and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.2(c)
. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by IDEC, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of whole shares of IDEC Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates surrendered by such holder) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.1
(which shall be uncertificated book entry form unless a physical certificate is requested), payment in lieu of fractional shares which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 2.1(e)
and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.2(c)

In the event of a transfer of ownership of Biogen Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of Biogen, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of IDEC Common Stock may be issued to a Person (as defined in
Section 8.3(o)
) other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of IDEC Common Stock to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of IDEC that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.2(b)
, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration (and any amounts to be paid pursuant to
Section 2.1(e)
or
Section 2.2(c)
) upon such surrender. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any amount payable pursuant to
Section 2.1(e)
or
Section 2.2(c)
.
        (c)
    Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares.
    No dividends or other distributions with respect to IDEC Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of IDEC Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to
Section 2.1(e)
hereof, until such Certificate has been surrendered in accordance with this
Article II
. Subject to Applicable Law (as defined in
Section 3.1(g)(i))
, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the recordholder thereof, without interest, (i) promptly after such surrender, the number of whole shares of IDEC Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor pursuant to this
Article II
, together with any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of IDEC Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.1(e)
and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of IDEC Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of IDEC Common Stock.
        (d)
    No Further Ownership Rights in Biogen Common Stock.
    All shares of IDEC Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
Article II
and any cash paid pursuant to
Section 2.1(e)
or
Section 2.2(c)
shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Biogen Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Biogen shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Biogen Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II
.
        (e)
    Termination of Exchange Fund.
    Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to IDEC, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II
shall thereafter look only to IDEC for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of IDEC Common Stock pursuant to
Section 2.1(e)
and any dividends or distributions pursuant to
Section 2.2(c)
.
        (f)
    No Liability.
    None of IDEC, Merger Sub, Biogen or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of IDEC Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to seven years after the Effective Time, or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any shares of IDEC Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of IDEC Common Stock or any dividends or distributions with respect to IDEC Common Stock issuable in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in
Section 3.1(c)(v)
), any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
        (g)
    Investment of Exchange Fund.
    The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by IDEC on a daily basis
provided
that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to former stockholders of Biogen after the Effective Time pursuant to this
Article II
. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable pursuant to this
Article II
shall promptly be paid to IDEC.
        (h)
    Withholding Rights.
    IDEC or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person who was a holder of Biogen Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time such amounts as IDEC or the Exchange Agent may be required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by IDEC or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would otherwise have been paid.
        (i)
    Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.
    In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of IDEC Common Stock as may be required pursuant to
Section 2.1(a)
, cash for fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.1(e)
and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.2(c)
;
provided
,
however,
that IDEC may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form reasonably satisfactory to IDEC, or a bond in such sum as IDEC may reasonably direct as indemnity, against any claim that may be made against IDEC or the Exchange Agent in respect of the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Benefit Plans
") with or for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer or director of Biogen or any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates (as defined in
Section 3.1(i)(vi)

Each Biogen Benefit Plan, including any material amendments thereto, that is capable of approval by, or registration or qualification for special tax status with, the appropriate taxation, social security or supervisory authorities in the relevant country, state, territory or the like (each, an "
Approval

For purposes of this Agreement, "
Funded Retirement Plan
" means, with respect to a party, a Benefit Plan that is a "pension plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (whether or not such Benefit Plan is subject to ERISA) and under which the assets to satisfy the benefit obligations are legally segregated from the general assets of such party or its Subsidiaries and are not subject to the creditors of such party or its Subsidiaries. None of Biogen or any other person or entity under common control within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (an "
ERISA Affiliate
") with Biogen has incurred any liability to a Funded Retirement Plan under Title IV of ERISA (other than for contributions not yet due) or to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (other than for payment of premiums not yet due) that, when aggregated with other such liabilities, would result in a material liability of Biogen and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, which liability has not been fully paid.
        (vi)  At no time has Biogen or any ERISA Affiliate of Biogen participated in and/or been obligated to contribute to any Benefit Plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA.
        (vii) No Biogen Benefit Plan provides health benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to employees or former employees of Biogen or any Subsidiary of Biogen after retirement or other termination of service (other than coverage mandated by Applicable Law or benefits, the full cost of which is borne by the employee or former employee).
        (viii) Neither the negotiation and execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event under any Biogen Benefit Plan that will or may result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration of payment, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any employee or former employee of Biogen or any Subsidiary of Biogen. There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement with an employee or former employee of Biogen to which Biogen or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as of the date of this Agreement, that, individually or collectively and as a result of the transaction contemplated hereby (whether alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) or otherwise, would reasonably be likely to give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Sections 280G or 162(m) of the Code.

        (iii)  The unpaid Taxes of Biogen and its Subsidiaries (A) did not, as of the most recent financial statements contained in the Biogen SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of such financial statements (rather than in any notes thereto), and (B) do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time since the date of such financial statements in accordance with the past custom and practice of Biogen and its Subsidiaries in filing their Tax Returns.
        (iv)  There is no audit, examination, deficiency, refund litigation, proposed adjustment or matter in controversy with respect to any Taxes or Tax Return of Biogen or its Subsidiaries which if determined adversely would be expected to result in a material Tax deficiency.

        (viii) Biogen and each of its Subsidiaries has delivered or made available to IDEC complete copies of all material income Tax Returns of Biogen and each of its Subsidiaries, including any predecessors thereof, for taxable years ending between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2002, excepting such Tax Returns as have not been filed for the taxable year ending December 31, 2002 pursuant to appropriate extensions with respect thereto.
        (ix)  Neither Biogen nor any of its Subsidiaries has: (A) filed a consent under Section 341(f) of the Code concerning collapsible corporations; (B) agreed to make nor is it required to make any material adjustment under Section 481(a) of the Code by reason of a change in accounting method or otherwise; (C) constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (I) in the two years prior to the date of this Agreement or (II) in a distribution which could otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in connection with the Merger; or (D) taken any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
        (x)   Neither Biogen nor any of its Subsidiaries is, or has been, a United States real property holding corporation (as defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code) during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.

None of IDEC or any ERISA Affiliate of IDEC has incurred any liability to a Funded Retirement Plan under Title IV of
ERISA (other than for contributions not yet due) or to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (other than for payment of premiums not yet due) that, when aggregated with other such liabilities, would result in a material liability of IDEC and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, which liability has not been fully paid.
        (vi)  At no time has IDEC or any ERISA Affiliate of IDEC participated in and/or been obligated to contribute to any Benefit Plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA.

        (viii) Neither the negotiation and execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event under any IDEC Benefit Plan that will or may result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration of payment, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any employee or former employee of IDEC or any Subsidiary of IDEC. There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement with an employee or former employee of IDEC to which IDEC or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as of the date of this Agreement, that, individually or collectively and as a result of the transaction contemplated hereby (whether alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) or otherwise, would reasonably be likely to give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Sections 280G or 162(m) of the Code.

        (iii)  The unpaid Taxes of IDEC and its Subsidiaries (A) did not, as of the most recent financial statements contained in the IDEC SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of such financial statements (rather than in any notes thereto), and (B) do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time since the date of such financial statements in accordance with the past custom and practice of IDEC and its Subsidiaries in filing their Tax Returns.
        (iv)  There is no audit, examination, deficiency, refund litigation, proposed adjustment or matter in controversy with respect to any Taxes or Tax Return of IDEC or its Subsidiaries which if determined adversely would be expected to result in a material Tax deficiency.
Neither IDEC nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of any claim made by a governmental authority in a jurisdiction where IDEC or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, does not file a Tax Return, that IDEC or such Subsidiary is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

        (vi)  There are no outstanding requests, agreements, consents or waivers to extend the statutory period of limitations applicable to the assessment of any Taxes or deficiencies against IDEC or any of its Subsidiaries, and no power of attorney granted by either IDEC or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Taxes is currently in force.
        (vii) Neither IDEC nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement providing for the allocation or sharing of Taxes imposed on or with respect to any individual or other Person, and neither IDEC nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an affiliated group (or similar state, local or foreign filing group) filing a consolidated income Tax Return (other than the group the common parent of which is IDEC) or (B) has any liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than IDEC or any of its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation  1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise.
        (viii) IDEC and each of its Subsidiaries has delivered or made available to Biogen complete copies of all material income Tax Returns of IDEC and each of its Subsidiaries, including any predecessors thereof, for taxable years ending between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2002, excepting such Tax Returns as have not been filed for the taxable year ending December 31, 2002 pursuant to appropriate extensions with respect thereto.
        (ix)  Neither IDEC nor any of its Subsidiaries has: (A) filed a consent under Section 341(f) of the Code concerning collapsible corporations; (B) agreed to make nor is it required to make any material adjustment under Section 481(a) of the Code by reason of a change in accounting method or otherwise; (C) constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (I) in the two years prior to the date of this Agreement or (II) in a distribution which could otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in connection with the Merger; or (D) taken any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
        (x)   Neither IDEC nor any of its Subsidiaries is, or has been, a United States real property holding corporation (as defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code) during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.

        (c)
    Superior Proposals.
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Section 4.2(a)
, in the event that Biogen or IDEC, as the case may be, receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Alternative Transaction Proposal which is determined (in accordance with
Section 8.3(q)
) to be a Superior Proposal (as defined in
Section 8.3(q)
), it may then take the following actions (but only (1) if and to the extent that (x) its Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so is reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under Applicable Law,

(y) Biogen or IDEC, as the case may be, has given the other party at least one business day prior written notice of its intention to take any of the following actions and of the identity of the Person or group making such Superior Proposal and the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and (2) if it shall not have breached in any material respect any of the provisions of this

        (d)

Change of Recommendation

        (4)   The Board of Directors of Biogen or IDEC, as the case may be, has concluded in good faith, after receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the failure of the Board of Directors to effect a Change of Recommendation is reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under Applicable Law; and
        (5)   Biogen or IDEC, as the case may be, shall have complied with
Section 4.2(c)
and shall not have breached in any material respect any of the other provisions set forth in this

        SECTION 5.1
    Preparation of SEC Documents; Stockholders' Meetings.
    
        (a)   As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, IDEC and Biogen shall prepare and file with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement, and IDEC shall prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of IDEC and Biogen shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing. IDEC will use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to IDEC's stockholders, and Biogen will use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to Biogen's stockholders, in each case as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. IDEC shall also take any action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or to file a general consent to service of process) required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance of shares of IDEC Common Stock in the Merger and the conversion of Biogen Options into options to acquire IDEC Common Stock, and Biogen shall furnish all information concerning Biogen and the holders of Biogen Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement will be made by IDEC without Biogen's prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) and without providing Biogen the opportunity to review and comment thereon. IDEC will advise Biogen promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the IDEC Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information (including any Change of Recommendation) relating to IDEC or Biogen, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by IDEC or Biogen which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the stockholders of IDEC and Biogen.
        (b)   Each of Biogen and IDEC shall, as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act, take all action necessary in accordance with Applicable Law and the Biogen Organizational Documents, in the case of Biogen, and the IDEC Organizational Documents, in the case of IDEC, to duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders to be held as promptly as practicable to consider, in the case of IDEC, the Share Issuance, the IDEC Charter Amendment and approval of the New IDEC Stock Plan (as defined in
Section 8.3(n)
) and the New IDEC Annual Bonus Plan (as defined in
Section 8.3(m)
) (the "
IDEC Stockholders' Meeting
") and, in the case of Biogen, the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger (the "
Biogen Stockholders' Meeting
"). Subject to
Section 4.2(d)
, each of Biogen and IDEC will use all commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of, in the case of IDEC, the Share Issuance, the IDEC Charter Amendment and approval of the New IDEC Stock Plan and the New IDEC Annual Bonus Plan, and, in the case of Biogen, the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger, and will take all other action necessary
or advisable to secure the vote or consent of its stockholders required by the rules of the Nasdaq National Market or Applicable Law to obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Biogen or IDEC may adjourn or postpone the Biogen Stockholders' Meeting or IDEC Stockholders' Meeting, as the case may be, to the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement is provided to its respective stockholders in advance of a vote on, in the case of IDEC, the Share Issuance, the IDEC Charter Amendment and approval of the New IDEC Stock Plan and the New IDEC Annual Bonus Plan, and, in the case of Biogen, the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, or, if, as of the time for which the Biogen Stockholders' Meeting or IDEC Stockholders' Meeting, as the case may be, is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Biogen Common Stock or IDEC Common Stock, as the case may be, represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting. Each of Biogen and IDEC shall ensure that the Biogen Stockholders' Meeting and the IDEC Stockholders' Meeting, respectively, is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited in connection with the Biogen Stockholders' Meeting or IDEC Stockholders' Meeting, as the case may be, are solicited in compliance with Applicable Law, the rules of the Nasdaq National Market and, in the case of Biogen, the Biogen Organizational Documents, and, in the case of IDEC, the IDEC Organizational Documents. Without the prior written consent of Biogen, the IDEC Charter Amendment, the Share Issuance and approval and adoption of the New IDEC Stock Plan and the New IDEC Annual Bonus Plan are the only matters which IDEC shall propose to be acted on by IDEC's stockholders at the IDEC Stockholders' Meeting. Without the prior written consent of IDEC, approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger is the only matter which Biogen shall propose to be acted on by Biogen's stockholders at the Biogen Stockholders' Meeting.
        (c)   Each of Biogen and IDEC will use commercially reasonable efforts to hold the Biogen Stockholders' Meeting and IDEC Stockholders' Meeting, respectively, on the same date as the other party and as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement.
        (d)   Except to the extent expressly permitted by
Section 4.2(d)
: (i) the Board of Directors of each of Biogen and IDEC shall recommend that its stockholders vote in favor of, in the case of Biogen, the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger at the Biogen Stockholders' Meeting, and, in the case of IDEC, the Share Issuance, the IDEC Charter Amendment and approval and adoption of the New IDEC Stock Plan and the New IDEC Annual Bonus Plan at the IDEC Stockholders' Meetings, (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the Board of Directors of (A) IDEC has recommended that IDEC's stockholders vote in favor of the Share Issuance, the IDEC Charter Amendment and approval and adoption of the New IDEC Stock Plan and the New IDEC Annual Bonus Plan at the IDEC Stockholders' Meeting and (B) Biogen has recommended that Biogen's stockholders vote in favor of approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger at the Biogen Stockholders' Meeting, and (iii) neither the Board of Directors of Biogen or IDEC nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to the other party, the recommendation of its respective Board of Directors that the respective stockholders of Biogen or IDEC vote in favor of, in the case of Biogen, the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, and, in the case of IDEC, the Share Issuance, the IDEC Charter Amendment and approval and adoption of the New IDEC Stock Plan and the New IDEC Annual Bonus Plan.
        SECTION 5.2
    Accountant's Letters.
    Each of Biogen and IDEC shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to the other party two letters from their respective independent accountants, one dated approximately as of the date the Form S-4 is declared effective and one dated approximately as of the Closing Date, each addressed to the other party, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the other party and customary in scope and substance for comfort letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the Form S-4.
        SECTION 5.3
    Access to Information; Confidentiality.
    
        (a)   Subject to the CDA and subject to Applicable Law, each of IDEC and Biogen shall, and shall cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the other party and to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives of such other party, reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to all their respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records (
provided
that such access shall not interfere with the business or operations of such party) and, during such period, each of IDEC and Biogen shall, and shall cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other party (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws and (b) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request. No review pursuant to this
Section 5.3
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein, the covenants or agreements of the parties hereto or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto under this Agreement.
        (b)   Each of IDEC and Biogen will hold, and will cause its respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information in accordance with the terms of the CDA.
        SECTION 5.4
    Reasonable Efforts.
    
        (a)   Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use their commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, including all filings required by the HSR Act (the initial filing required by the HSR Act to be filed promptly within the meaning of the HSR Act) and any applicable antitrust, competition or similar laws of any foreign jurisdiction, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. Subject to Applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information and in addition to
Section 5.4(b)
, Biogen and IDEC shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, all the information relating to Biogen and its Subsidiaries or IDEC and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Each assumed Biogen Option shall be vested immediately following the Effective Time as to the same percentage of the total number of shares subject thereto as it was vested as to immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent such Biogen Option (either by its terms or by the terms of another agreement) provides for acceleration of vesting.

termination, and that each participant's accumulated contributions for such offering period are applied towards the purchase of Biogen Common Stock immediately prior to such termination unless the participant has previously withdrawn from such offering period in accordance with the terms of such plan. Effective as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, all Continuing Employees (as defined in
Section 5.12(c)
) shall be permitted to participate in the IDEC Purchase Plan in accordance with the terms of such plan.
        (c)   For one year following the Effective Time, IDEC shall provide or cause to be provided to those of its employees and employees of the Surviving Corporation or any other Affiliate of IDEC who were employees of Biogen immediately prior to the Effective Time ("

        (d)   Following the Effective Time, IDEC shall recognize (or cause to be recognized) the service of each Continuing Employee with Biogen or its Subsidiaries for purposes of (i) eligibility and vesting under any IDEC Benefit Plan, (ii) determination of benefits levels under any vacation or severance IDEC Benefit Plan and (iii) determination of "retiree" status under any IDEC Benefit Plan, for which the Continuing Employee is otherwise eligible and in which the Continuing Employee is offered participation, in each case except where such crediting would result in a duplication of benefits. To the extent IDEC establishes or designates an IDEC Benefit Plan to provide group health benefits to Continuing Employees, (i) each such IDEC Benefit Plan shall waive pre-existing condition limitations with respect to Continuing Employees to the same extent waived or no longer applicable under the applicable group health plan of Biogen and (ii) each Continuing Employee shall be given credit under the applicable IDEC Benefit Plan for amounts paid under the corresponding group health plan of Biogen or an Affiliate during the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums for such plan year.
        (e)   As of the Effective Time, IDEC shall assume and agree to perform in accordance with their terms all employment, severance and other compensation agreements and arrangements existing as of the date hereof, and provided to IDEC by Biogen prior to the date hereof, between Biogen or any Biogen Subsidiary and any director, officer or employee thereof and any such agreements or arrangements entered into after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time by Biogen or any Biogen Subsidiary in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.
        (f)    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of either party to terminate, any Continuing Employee for any reason or (ii) require either party to continue any IDEC Benefit Plan or Biogen Benefit Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time.

Exhibit 99.1
AVONEX(R) and Rituxan(R) Products Anchor Autoimmune Disease and Cancer Therapeutic Focus
Biogen Shareholders to Receive 1.150 Shares of IDEC for Each Biogen Share, Resulting in Approximately Equal Ownership of BIOGEN IDEC INC.
BIOGEN IDEC INC. Expects 15% Compound Annual Sales Growth, Cash EPS Growth of 20%, and Over $300 Million of Operating Expense Synergies Through 2007
Expected to be Cash EPS Accretive by 15 Plus Percent Upon Closing
Fusion of Complementary Products, Pipeline and R&D Strengths Significantly Accelerates Strategic Plans of Both Companies
William H. Rastetter to be Executive Chairman, James C. Mullen to be CEO of Combined Company
        SAN DIEGO, and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 23, 2003 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX/Creating a new global biotechnology industry leader, with top products and capabilities in cancer and autoimmune diseases, IDEC Pharmaceutical Corporation (Nasdaq: IDPH) and Biogen, Inc. (Nasdaq: BGEN) today announced that they have signed a definitive merger agreement. The combined company will be called BIOGEN IDEC INC.
        "Biogen and IDEC are two remarkably complementary companies in virtually every sensetherapeutic focus, R&D capabilities, manufacturing infrastructure and financial position," said William H. Rastetter, Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of IDEC.
        "Bringing our companies together accelerates both companies' strategic plans and creates a biotechnology leader with the products, pipeline, infrastructure and financial resources to grow faster and create sustainable shareholder value beyond what either company could achieve separately," said James C. Mullen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Biogen.
        IDEC has a strong franchise in cancer and a growing focus on autoimmune diseases, while Biogen is strong in the autoimmune area and is increasingly developing capabilities in cancer. The merger is expected to enable the companies to:
significantly accelerate their strategic plans;
diversify their product portfolios and revenue bases, with two blockbuster drugs, AVONEX(R) (Interferon beta-1a) and Rituxan(R) (rituximab), and 10 products in clinical development;
strengthen their commitments to R&D through an annual R&D budget of more than $550 million and 1,000 dedicated R&D employees;
broaden their respective drug-development programs, including becoming a partner-of-choice for companies seeking to partner promising biologic products in development;
avoid duplicative and costly infrastructure buildups, particularly in manufacturing and general administration;
achieve cumulative operating expense synergies of over $300 million through 2007; and
achieve cumulative capital expenditure synergies of over $175 million through 2007.
        Based on expected growth from the combined product line-up and the anticipated contribution of pipeline products, as well as anticipated sales, marketing and manufacturing synergies and capital investments avoided, the companies foresee BIOGEN IDEC achieving 15 percent compound annual
revenue growth, and approximately 20 percent compound annual cash earnings per share growth in the 2003 - 2007 period.
        "With $550 million in R&D spending per year and 1,000 R&D employees, BIOGEN IDEC expects to continue to pioneer breakthrough products for patients with high unmet medical needs," Mr. Mullen concluded.
        "Both operationally and culturally, this combination is a perfect fit," said Dr. Rastetter. "The companies' scientists and management teams have known and respected their counterparts for years. This led earlier this year to a collaborative agreement in cancer out of which grew both a closer relationship and the recognition that we each had the strategic pieces that the other was looking for."
Transaction Summary
        Under terms of the merger agreement, each share of Biogen common stock will be exchanged for 1.150 shares of IDEC common stock. On a pro-forma, fully diluted basis, IDEC shareholders will own 50.5 percent of the stock of the combined company and Biogen shareholders will own 49.5 percent.
        The merger agreement has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies. The transaction is subject to approval by the shareholders of both companies, as well as regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of Q3 or early in Q4 of 2003.
        Goldman, Sachs & Co. acted as financial advisors and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP acted as legal counsel to Biogen. Merrill Lynch & Co. acted as financial advisors and Pillsbury Winthrop LLP acted as legal counsel to IDEC.
Profile of the Combined Company
        The combined company will have pro forma 2002 revenue of $1.55 billion and a strong balance sheet with more than $1.5 billion in net cash.
        Excluding merger-related expenses, such as in process R&D write-off and amortization of identifiable intangible assets, the transaction is expected to be accretive by 15 plus percent to IDEC cash EPS immediately following closing of the transaction. On a GAAP EPS basis, the transaction is expected to be accretive within two to three years.
        BIOGEN IDEC will be headquartered in Cambridge, MA and will maintain centers of excellence in San Diego and Cambridge focused, respectively, on oncology and immunology. In addition, BIOGEN IDEC will have international operations in Europe, Canada, Australia, and Japan.
        The two companies have already determined the organizational structure of BIOGEN IDEC and have selected members of the senior management team. In addition to Dr. Rastetter, who will become Executive Chairman of the combined company, and Mr. Mullen, who will become the CEO, the leadership will consist of: Peter N. Kellogg, Chief Financial Officer of Biogen, who will become CFO; William R. Rohn, President and Chief Operating Officer of IDEC, who will become COO; Nabil Hanna, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of IDEC, who will become head of research; and Burt A. Adelman, M.D., Executive Vice President, Research and Development of Biogen, who will become head of development. Each member of the management team brings two to three decades of industry experience to the combined entity. The Board of Directors of the combined company will consist of 10 independent directors, five chosen from each company plus Mr. Mullen, CEO, and Dr. Rastetter, Executive Chairman.
Key Product Highlights
        The BIOGEN IDEC product lineup will be led by two blockbuster drugs, each with annual net sales of more than $1 billion:
AVONEX, for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. AVONEX maintains a market share of close to 50 percent in the U.S., with 2002 worldwide net sales of $1.113 billion.
Rituxan for the treatment of certain B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Worldwide net sales of Rituxan, which was discovered by IDEC and which IDEC co-promotes in the U.S. with Genentech, Inc., were $1.479 billion in 2002. IDEC receives a share of operating profits from sales of Rituxan in the U.S., which was $324.5 million in 2002, and a royalty on sales outside the U.S., which was $45.43 million in 2002.
Products recently launched by the two companies in the U.S. include:
AMEVIVE(R) (alefacept), a biologic launched by Biogen in February 2003 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.
Zevalin(R) (ibritumomab tiuxetan), a radioimmunotherapy for the treatment of certain B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, launched by IDEC in April 2002.
R&D Highlights
        The combined company will have a projected initial R&D budget of over $550 million and 1,000 R&D employees, including approximately 400 in discovery research. A deep pipeline of products in development includes ANTEGREN(R) (natalizumab), in partnership with Elan Corporation plc, now in Phase III clinical studies for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease; and Rituxan for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, also in Phase III studies. Altogether there are 10 candidates in clinical studies for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases.

Revenues for the second quarter of 2003 included $118.4 million recorded for IDEC's joint business arrangement with Genentech for the commercialization of Rituxan (Rituximab), which IDEC copromotes in the U.S. with Genentech, compared to $92.5 million for the second quarter of 2002.  Revenues in the second quarter of 2003 also included $5.0 million in U.S. net sales of Zevalin (ibritumomab tiuxetan), which IDEC markets alone in the U.S. and was launched in April 2002, compared to $3.3 million for the second quarter of 2002.
 
Rituxan Revenues
 
U.S. net sales of Rituxan in the second quarter of 2003, as recorded by Genentech, were $328 million compared to $257 million for the same period in 2002.
 
"We were very pleased with the performance of Rituxan in the second quarter," said William R. Rohn, IDEC's president and chief operating officer. "Net U.S. sales increased $71 million in the second quarter, representing a 28 percent increase from the same quarter last year."
 
IDEC's royalty revenue on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. is based on Roche's and Zenyaku's end-user sales and is recorded with a one-quarter lag.  IDEC recognized, during the second quarter of 2003, $13.9 million in royalties from Roche's and Zenyaku's end-user sales during the first quarter of 2003.
Revenues from unconsolidated joint business reflect the financial results from the commercialization of Rituxan by IDEC and Genentech.  Revenues from unconsolidated joint business includes various revenues associated with Rituxan commercialization such as IDEC's share of pretax copromotion profits, reimbursements from Genentech for IDEC's Rituxan-related sales force and development expenses, and royalty revenues on sales of Rituximab outside the United States by Roche and Zenyaku.  Roche has marketing rights to Rituximab outside of the U.S., and copromotes Rituxan in Japan with Zenyaku.
 
 
Operating Costs and Expenses
Operating costs and expenses for the second quarter of 2003 increased to $80.4 million from $47.1 million for the second quarter of 2002.  The higher 2003 operating expenses are primarily the result of the $20 million one-time signing payment made to Genentech, the write-off of $3.1 million of Zevalin commercial inventory that did not meet quality specifications, increased legal expenses to protect IDEC's intellectual property rights, and increased sales and marketing expenses to support commercialization of Zevalin.
Cash Position
IDEC ended the second quarter of 2003 with cash, cash equivalents and securities available-for-sale totaling $1.5 billion.

ARTICLE 8 MANUFACTURE AND SUPPLY
IDEC shall be responsible for, at its own expense, process development, scale-up, validation and FDA licensure of its existing C2B8-producing CHO cell line to the 2,750 liter fermenter scale.  As soon as practicable after the Original Effective Date, IDEC will transfer to Genentech a re-amplified CHO C2B8-producing cell line, and, within 30 days of the Original Effective Date, transfer the technology to be licensed to Genentech under the terms and conditions of the Expression Technology License of even date herewith, and provide reasonable training of Genentech personnel as requested by Genentech necessary to allow Genentech to scale up C2B8 process with the re-amplified cell line.  Immediately after receipt of IDEC's re-amplified CHO C2B8 producing cell line by Genentech, Genentech will begin work, at its own expense, on the scale-up of a re-amplified cell line in optimal growth media to produce C2B8 at commercial scale.  If Genentech determines that such scale up is not commercially feasible, it will so notify the JDC.  Upon the decision of the JDC to go forward, Genentech will, at its own expense, attempt to scale

If Genentech has successfully scaled up a cell line to its commercial scale and IDEC is then manufacturing C2B8, Genentech will, at its own expense, transfer the optimized cell line and information sufficient to allow IDEC to manufacture C2B8 by essentially the same process used by Genentech except for the size of the fermentation vessel.  If bridging or any other studies are required to permit the use or sale of C2B8 produced by Genentech by the optimized process, the costs of such clinical studies shall be paid by Genentech, but shall be charged against Operating Profits over the first three years after the first commercial sale of C2B8 produced by the optimized process.  IDEC will otherwise be responsible, at its own expense, for all expenses incurred in obtaining Regulatory Approvals for the manufacturing process used to produce C2B8, except that Genentech, at its own expense, will pay the expenses incurred to receive FDA licensure of Genentech facilities.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.1, costs incurred by either Party under this Section 8.1 after Regulatory Approval in the United States shall be charged to Operating Profits.
 
IDEC shall, pursuant to a Supply Agreement to be entered into between the Parties prior to the date of the first submission of an application or registration for Regulatory Approval, supply all requirements for C2B8 in final vial form for commercial sale in all territories for the first two years after the first Regulatory Approval in the United States or Europe, whichever comes earlier (the "Initial Commercial Period").  The average annual Cost of Goods Sold of C2B8 packaged in final vial form during the Initial Commercial Period shall be the lower of (i) or (ii) .  IDEC may continue to supply, at its option, commercial requirements for C2B8 up to the capacity of its current manufacturing plant in San Diego (the "Supply Option").  The Supply Option shall be exercised, if at all, by written notice on or before the date of the first Regulatory Approval including a good faith estimate of IDEC's planned production levels.  If the parties determine that the FDA will not grant establishment licenses to two manufacturing facilities using different scales of production, then the parties will use best efforts to develop a manufacturing capacity plan by the first Regulatory Approval.  Subsequent to the Initial Commercial Period, if both Parties are manufacturing Licensed Product at the same time, the Cost of Goods Sold for both Parties used for calculation of Operating Profits shall be the lower of Genentech's or IDEC's actual cost of Goods Sold for commercial production of C2B8 packaged in final vial form.

Exhibit 99.2
 
Genentech and IDEC Announce Humanized Anti-CD20 Antibody Development Collaboration
Friday June 20, 4:19 pm ET
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. and SAN DIEGO(BUSINESS WIRE)June 20, 2003Genentech, Inc. (NYSE:DNA - News) and IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Nasdaq:IDPH - News) today announced plans to develop one or more new humanized anti-CD20 antibodies targeting B-cell disorders for a broad range of indications. Financial terms of the profit-sharing collaboration were not disclosed.
 
Genentech and IDEC plan to file an investigational new drug application (IND) on their first humanized anti-CD20 antibody by the end of this year. The companies plan to work efficiently together to develop and commercialize additional anti-CD20 products that are targeted for specific patient populations, depending on the severity of their B-cell disorder. The primary focus of this collaboration will be to develop and launch a humanized anti-CD20 molecule while evaluating the utility for more efficacious follow-on humanized molecules.
 
Humanized anti-CD20 antibodies work by binding to a particular protein (the CD20 antigen) on the surface of normal and malignant B-cells. From there, they recruit the body's natural defenses to attack and kill the marked B-cells. Stem cells (B-cell progenitors) in bone marrow lack the CD20 antigen, allowing healthy B-cells to regenerate after treatment and return to normal levels within several months.
 
This
will be the second collaboration between Genentech and IDEC. In 1995, Genentech and IDEC signed an agreement to develop and market Rituxan (Rituximab), a chimeric anti-CD20 antibody. In November 1997, Rituxan became the first recombinant antibody to receive U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for cancer in the United States, and in 2002, had sales of more than $1 billion. More than 300,000 patients have been treated to date with Rituxan worldwide. Rituxan is indicated for the single-agent treatment of relapsed or refractory low-grade or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).
 
"We are delighted to broaden our already successful collaboration with Genentech," said William R. Rohn, IDEC's president and chief operating officer. "Our plan to develop a humanized anti-CD20 antibody is both an opportunity to strengthen our current oncology franchise as well as to extend it into a variety of autoimmune disease indications."
"This collaboration should help the companies to continue to play a leading role in addressing B-cell disorders," said Joseph S. McCracken, vice president of Business and Commercial Development of Genentech. "We look forward to expanding our relationship with IDEC and developing one or more new molecules that may provide significant benefit to patients with B-cell mediated diseases."

Item 5.    Other Events
        On Friday, June 20, 2003, IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation ("IDEC") and Genentech, Inc. ("Genentech") announced that they had entered into an amended and restated collaboration agreement dated as of June 19, 2003 (the "Collaboration Agreement") to develop one or more new humanized anti-CD20 antibodies targeting B-cell disorders for a broad range of indications.
        The Collaboration Agreement provides for the coordination of commercial efforts related to Rituxan and development efforts related to new products. Under the agreement, the parties have agreed to collaborate diligently to develop certain new product candidates. The parties will share in the development expenses of any new products developed under the agreement and each will contribute specified personnel to the development efforts. In addition, the parties have agreed to employ certain marketing and sales efforts with respect to sales of products in the United States.
        Under the agreement, IDEC will receive certain royalty payments on products sold outside the United States and Canada and both parties will share operating profits or losses on sales of products within the United States. The royalty period with respect to each product to be sold outside the United States is 11 years from the first commercial sale of such product. Rituxan achieved net sales of $638 million in the United States for the first half of 2003 (of which IDEC recorded $192 million as its share of copromotion profits) and $1.08 billion in the United States for the year ended December 31, 2002 (of which IDEC recorded $324 million as its share of copromotion profits).
        The Collaboration Agreement provides a mechanism by which either party may purchase or sell its rights in the copromotion territory from or to the other party. Upon the occurrence of specified events that constitute a change of control of IDEC, Genentech may elect to present an offer to IDEC to purchase IDEC's copromotion rights. IDEC must then accept Genentech's offer or purchase Genentech's copromotion rights for an amount scaled (using the profit sharing ratio between the parties) to Genentech's offer.
        The agreement also (i) contains representations, warranties and covenants by each of the parties, (ii) contains confidentiality and indemnity obligations of the parties, (iii) provides for a joint management committee between the parties to oversee the activities of the parties under the agreement, (iv) provides for certain development and commercialization obligations of the parties and (v) addresses manufacturing and supply matters pertaining to the products that are the subject of the agreement.
        The obligations of the parties under the agreement terminate at various times. In general, (i) with respect to products as to which Genentech is obligated to pay a royalty, the obligations of the parties terminate at such time as the royalty obligations for such products terminate and (ii) with respect to products that are copromoted, the obligations of the parties terminate at such time as the parties are no longer entitled to receive a share of operating profits and losses under the agreement. Following expiration of the agreement, but not an earlier termination, all licenses granted by a party under the agreement to the other party will become fully paid and irrevocable.
        The Collaboration Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Explanatory Note
        This Form 8-K/A is being filed solely for the purpose of re-filing the redacted Collaboration Agreement and does not reflect any events occurring after the date of filing of the original Form 8-K or otherwise modify or update any of the information contained therein.

In addition, and notwithstanding the dispute resolution provisions of Sections 3.1 through 3.4, with regard to the commercialization of New Products, including without limitation G2H7, and with regard to all Franchise Products (including without limitation C2B8)
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]
, Genentech shall have final decision-making control over the implementation of each such commercialization plan, including without limitation, marketing and promotional activities and materials (e.g., medical education, medical information, public relations, investigator sponsored studies, publication planning, sales resource analysis and key opinion leader development), provided, however, that Genentech shall not have the right to (i) exceed (in the aggregate) the Annual Commercial Operating Budget approved with such commercialization plan by
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]
without the unanimous approval of the JCC, (ii) assign tasks to IDEC that were not otherwise approved by unanimous consent of the JCC, (iii) assign an initial pricing for a Franchise Product, unless such initial pricing is within
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]
of the current price for C2B8, or (iv) materially amend a commercialization plan without the unanimous approval of the JCC. For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that Genentech's implementation of a commercialization plan shall not be deemed a material amendment to such commercialization plan, unless such implementation would materially modify the strategic direction agreed upon by the Parties thereunder. All documentary information, promotional materials and oral presentations (where practical) regarding the detailing and promoting of New Products shall maximize the brand equity of the products and display, where appropriate (i.e., to the extent such materials identify or otherwise make reference to either of the Parties), the names and logos of each of IDEC and Genentech with equal prominence.
        
5.5    Training Program.
    Genentech shall develop training programs relating to Franchise Products for the sales forces of each respective Party and for any Third Parties engaged in selling or promotion, and shall assign responsibility to itself, IDEC or a Third Party for the preparation of materials and conduct of training. The Parties agree to utilize such training programs on an ongoing basis to assure a consistent, focused promotional strategy. The initial training as to any Franchise Product shall be carried out at a time which is mutually acceptable to the Parties, and which is prior to but reasonably near the date on which the first Regulatory Approval for such Franchise Product is expected in the Co-Promotion Territory. As additional members are added to the Parties' respective sales forces, training will be given to groups of the newly selected members.
        
6.1    Development Efforts.
    Genentech will use commercially reasonable and diligent efforts to develop C2B8, including pursuing preclinical development and clinical development of C2B8 and obtaining Regulatory Approvals therefor in all countries in the Licensed Territory, taking into account the scientific and commercial potential of C2B8, including, without limitation, each of the potential indications in the Field for C2B8. Within ninety (90) days of the Original Effective Date, Genentech agrees to provide IDEC with a written development strategy for C2B8 in the Licensed Territory indicating (i) whether Genentech will develop C2B8 alone or with a partner in Europe, (ii) the identity of its European partner (if any), and (iii) a list of clinical trials which Genentech would conduct for C2B8 approval in Europe assuming adequate quantities of C2B8 are available.
        
6.2    Marketing Efforts.
    Genentech will use commercially reasonable and diligent efforts to commercialize C2B8 in each country in which Regulatory Approval is granted, taking into account the
scientific and commercial potential for C2B8, including without limitation each of the potential indications therefor.
        
6.3    Development Costs and Marketing Costs.
    Genentech shall bear all Development Costs and Marketing Costs for C2B8 for development or marketing in the Licensed Territory. Genentech shall have the sole responsibility for, and right to make all decisions regarding, all development and marketing activities in the Licensed Territory.
        
6.4    Cooperation on Development Efforts.
    To facilitate cooperation between the Parties on the worldwide development and marketing of C2B8, Genentech shall keep IDEC informed of all substantive development activities in the Licensed Territory, and agrees to use its good faith efforts to have an IDEC representative attend meetings of any development committee or similar body governing development activities of Licensed Products in the Licensed Territory. Genentech shall consider in good faith any comments made by such IDEC representative. The Parties agree that they will do nothing during C2B8 development activities to imperil early Regulatory Approvals in any country in any territory. Genentech further agrees that its European development plan for Licensed Products will not specify clinical trials on a time line that would delay or slow Regulatory Approval in the United States.

of the royalties it pays on account of the manufacture, use or sale of Licensed Products against royalties it owes to IDEC. Prior to the Original Effective Date, Genentech discussed with IDEC the significant Third Party royalties that it believed at such time would be payable on sales of Licensed Products. In addition, Genentech shall receive a credit of
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]
of the royalties it pays on account of the
manufacture, use or sale of New Products against royalties it owes to IDEC; provided, however that the royalty that would otherwise be due under Section 7.7(b) shall not be reduced below a

7.14    Sales By Sublicensees.
    In the event Genentech grants licenses or sublicenses to others to make or sell Franchise Products in the Licensed Territory, such licenses or sublicenses shall include an obligation for the licensee or sublicensee to account for and report its Royalty-Bearing Sales of such Franchise Products on the same basis as if such sales were Royalty-Bearing Sales by Genentech, and Genentech shall pay royalties to IDEC as if the Royalty-Bearing Sales of the licensee or sublicensee were Royalty-Bearing Sales of Genentech.
        
8.1    Process Development, Manufacturing Approvals of C2B8.
    IDEC shall be responsible for, at its own expense, process development, scale-up, validation and FDA licensure of its existing C2B8-producing CHO cell line to the 2,750 liter fermenter scale. As soon as practicable after the Original Effective Date, IDEC will transfer to Genentech a re-amplified CHO C2B8-producing cell line, and, within 30 days of the Original Effective Date, transfer the technology to be licensed to Genentech under the terms and conditions of the Expression Technology License of even date herewith, and provide reasonable training of Genentech personnel as requested by Genentech necessary to allow Genentech to scale up C2B8 process with the re-amplified cell line. Immediately after receipt of IDEC's re-amplified CHO C2B8 producing cell line by Genentech, Genentech will begin work, at its own expense, on the scale-up of a re-amplified cell line in optimal growth media to produce C2B8 at commercial scale. If Genentech determines that such scale up is not commercially feasible, it will so notify the JDC. Upon the decision of the JDC to go forward, Genentech will, at its own expense, attempt to scale up another cell line selected by the JDC or the cell line used for 2,750 liter fermenter scale production. If Genentech has successfully scaled up a cell line to its commercial scale and IDEC is then manufacturing C2B8, Genentech will, at its own expense, transfer the optimized cell line and information sufficient to allow IDEC to manufacture C2B8 by essentially the same process used by Genentech except for the size of the fermentation vessel. If bridging or any other studies are required to permit the use or sale of C2B8 produced by Genentech by the optimized process, the costs of such clinical studies shall be paid by Genentech, but shall be charged against Operating Profits over the first three years after the first commercial sale of C2B8 produced by the optimized process. IDEC will otherwise be responsible, at its own expense, for all expenses incurred in obtaining Regulatory Approvals for the manufacturing process used to produce C2B8, except that Genentech, at its own expense, will pay the expenses incurred to receive FDA licensure of Genentech facilities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.1, costs incurred by either Party under this Section 8.1 after Regulatory Approval in the United States shall be charged to Operating Profits.
        
8.2    Manufacture and Supply of C2B8.
    IDEC shall, pursuant to a Supply Agreement to be entered into between the Parties prior to the date of the first submission of an application or registration for Regulatory Approval, supply all requirements for C2B8 in final vial form for commercial sale in all territories for the first two years after the first Regulatory Approval in the United States or Europe, whichever comes earlier (the "Initial Commercial Period"). The average annual Cost of Goods Sold of C2B8 packaged in final vial form during the Initial Commercial Period shall be the lower of (i) 
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]
or (ii) 
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]
. IDEC may continue to supply, at its option, commercial requirements for C2B8 up to the capacity of its current manufacturing plant
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]
in San Diego (the "Supply Option"). The Supply Option shall be exercised, if at all, by written notice on or before the date of the first Regulatory Approval including a good faith estimate of IDEC's planned production levels. If the parties determine that the FDA will not grant establishment licenses to two manufacturing facilities using different scales of production, then the parties will use
best efforts to develop a manufacturing capacity plan by the first Regulatory Approval. Subsequent to the Initial Commercial Period, if both Parties are manufacturing Licensed Product at the same time, the Cost of Goods Sold for both Parties used for calculation of Operating Profits shall be the lower of Genentech's or IDEC's actual cost of Goods Sold for commercial production of C2B8 packaged in final vial form. After the Initial Commercial Period, Genentech shall manufacture all requirements of C2B8 for commercial sale in excess of that which IDEC has agreed to produce.
        
8.3    Transfer of Materials and Know-how for C2B8.
    
        (a)   IDEC shall on Genentech's request at any time transfer to, and fully enable Genentech with, the then most current version of all biological materials, know-how, reagents and expertise necessary for Genentech to undertake the manufacture of C2B8. IDEC shall periodically update biological materials and information related to C2B8 previously transferred to Genentech. All transfers of materials and information to Genentech shall be free of charge to Genentech; provided, however, IDEC's obligation to train Genentech personnel in the use of such material and information shall be limited to
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]
person hours.
        (b)   At the time Genentech completes the commercialization scale-up described in Section 8.1, if IDEC continues to manufacture commercial quantities of C2B8, Genentech will transfer to, and fully enable IDEC with, the then most current version of all biological materials, know-how, reagents and expertise applicable to the actual manufacturing process in use by IDEC necessary for IDEC to undertake the manufacture of C2B8 provided that IDEC uses such biological materials, know-how, reagents and expertise solely to manufacture C2B8. Genentech's obligation to train IDEC personnel in the use of such materials or information shall be limited to
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]
person hours.
        (c)   IDEC agrees to allow Genentech to audit, at its expense, any Regulatory Approval documentation in the possession of IDEC concerning products other than the Licensed Products to determine if such products utilize Genentech Patents or Genentech Know-how. Such audit(s) shall be conducted by an independent party to be mutually agreed upon by Genentech and IDEC, and shall be limited to one audit during any twelve month period.
        
8.4    Transfer Price of Products for C2B8.
    The transfer price for C2B8 supplied to Genentech for sale in the Licensed Territory will be
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]
. IDEC will invoice Genentech within 10 days after each shipment of C2B8 to the Licensed Territory on a shipment by shipment basis. Genentech shall pay each invoice within thirty (30) days of receipt of both of C2B8 and invoice.
        
8.5    Manufacture of C2B8 for Clinical Trials.
    
        (a)   IDEC will supply at no cost all quantities of C2B8 for pre-clinical studies and clinical trials in the Co-Promotion Territory directed toward obtaining the first Regulatory Approval in the Co-Promotion Territory.
        (b)   IDEC shall supply to Genentech, at IDEC's
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]
until the beginning of the Initial Commercial Period and at
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]
thereafter, all quantities of C2B8 for preclinical studies and clinical trials in the Licensed Territory or for expanded needs beyond those set forth in the original Development Plan.
        
8.6    Manufacture and Supply of Franchise Products (other than C2B8).
    Genentech shall be responsible, and have complete decision making control for all process development, scale-up, validation and FDA licensure for the manufacture of all Franchise Products (other than C2B8) in the Co-Promotion Territory, the cost of which shall be considered Development Costs pursuant to this Agreement. In addition, Genentech, either itself or through a third party manufacturer, shall be responsible for the manufacture and supply of clinical and commercial supply of New Products for the
Co-Promotion Territory (Genentech shall use commercially reasonable and diligent efforts to maintain a reasonable Cost of Goods Sold for manufacture and supply of all Franchise Products).
        
8.7    Right of First Negotiation for Manufacture and Supply of Franchise Products in the Co-Promotion Territory.
    In the event Genentech decides to seek a Third Party (other than F. Hoffmann La Roche AG) to manufacture and supply a particular Franchise Product in the Co-Promotion Territory, Genentech shall promptly notify IDEC in writing. IDEC shall have thirty (30) days from the date of Genentech's notice to IDEC to provide written notice to Genentech that it elects to negotiate with Genentech the rights under which it may manufacture and supply such Franchise Product in the Co-Promotion Territory, and a failure to timely so elect shall be deemed a decision not to negotiate for such rights. In the event that IDEC timely notifies Genentech of its desire to engage in such negotiations, then for a period of ninety (90) days, Genentech and IDEC shall use good faith efforts to agree upon terms under which IDEC would manufacture and supply such Franchise Product in the Co-Promotion Territory. In the event that IDEC and Genentech have not entered into a definitive agreement within ninety (90) days of IDEC's election to negotiate, then Genentech shall be free to grant to any Third Party the right to manufacture and supply such Franchise Product in the Co-Promotion Territory on any terms that Genentech considers appropriate.
        
9.1    Licensed Products
    
        (a)   Licenses To Genentech Within The Field. IDEC grants to Genentech a worldwide license (including Asia, pursuant to the First Amendment) under the IDEC Patents and IDEC Know-how and IDEC regulatory submissions in the Field to develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, have sold and import Licensed Products. Such license shall be co-exclusive with IDEC in the Co-Promotion Territory and exclusive even as to IDEC in the Licensed Territory.
        (b)   Nonexclusive License To IDEC. Genentech grants IDEC a nonexclusive license in the United States and Canada to use Genentech Know-how and Genentech Patents in the Field solely for the purposes of developing, manufacturing, having manufactured, using, selling, offering for sale, having sold and importing C2B8 and such additional Licensed Products as the Parties mutually agree to develop in the Co-Promotion Territory. IDEC covenants and agrees not to develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, have sold or import any product using any of the Genentech Know-how or Genentech Patents outside of the Field. If Genentech is sublicensing any Third Party patents under this grant, IDEC shall pay any royalties owed to any such Third Party on account of the manufacture, use or sale of any Licensed Products by IDEC.

12.11    Infringement Defense.
    
        (a)   
Defense in the Co-Promotion Territory
. If a Third Party asserts that a patent or other right owned by it is infringed by any Franchise Product in the Co-Promotion Territory, the JMC shall establish a plan for a common defense and select the Party responsible for managing such plan. The costs of any such action incurred by one or both of the Parties at the direction of the JMC (including the costs of any judgment, award, decree or settlement) will be chargeable to the collaboration as Other Operating Income/Expense pursuant to Exhibit A.
        (b)   
Defense in the Licensed Territory
. If a Third Party asserts that a patent or other right owned by it is infringed by any Franchise Product in the Licensed Territory, Genentech will be solely responsible for deciding how and whether to defend against any such assertions at its cost and expense. If Genentech is required to pay royalties to such Third Party as a result of such action, it will be entitled to deduct
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]
of such royalties against royalties owing to IDEC under, but only to the extent permitted by, Section 7.7(d).
        
13.1    Representations and Warranties.
    Each of the Parties hereby represents and warrants, as of the Restated Effective Date, as follows:
        (a)   This Agreement is a legal and valid obligation binding upon such Party and enforceable in accordance with its terms. The execution, delivery and performance of the Agreement by such Party does not conflict with any agreement, instrument or understanding, oral or written, to which it is a party or by which it is bound, nor violate any law or regulation of any court, governmental body or administrative or other agency having jurisdiction over it.
        (b)   Such Party has not, and during the term of the Agreement will not, grant any right to any Third Party relating to its respective Patents and Know-how in the Field which would conflict with the rights granted to the other Party hereunder.
        (c)   Each Party represents and warrants that it has the right to grant the licenses granted herein.
        (d)   Except as set forth on Exhibit D of the Original Agreement, IDEC is not obligated under any agreement as of the Original Effective Date to pay any Third Party royalties with respect to C2B8
As used in this Section 13.1, "Patents" means IDEC Patent with respect to IDEC, and Genentech Patents and Genentech NP Patents with respect to Genentech; and "Know-how" means IDEC Know-how with respect to IDEC, and Genentech Know-how with respect to Genentech.
        
13.2    Performance by Affiliates.
    The Parties recognize that each may perform some or all of its obligations under this Agreement through Affiliates, provided, however, that each Party shall remain responsible and be guarantor of the performance by its Affiliates and shall cause its Affiliates to comply with the provisions of this Agreement in connection with such performance.
        
14.1    Information.
    Genentech and IDEC will disclose and make available to each other all preclinical, clinical, regulatory, commercial and other information, including without limitation all information relevant to the joint promotion of Franchise Products, developed by Genentech or IDEC concerning Franchise Products at any time during the term of this Agreement. Each Party will use commercially reasonable and diligent efforts to disclose to the other Party all significant information promptly after it is learned or its significance is appreciated. Each Party shall own and maintain its own database of clinical trial data accumulated from all clinical trials of Franchise Products for which it was responsible and of adverse drug event information for all Franchise Products. At the option of the requesting Party, such data shall be provided in a computer readable format by the providing Party, to the extent available, which shall also assist in the transfer and validation of such data to the receiving Party.
        
14.2    Complaints.
    Each Party shall maintain a record of all complaints it receives with respect to any Franchise Product. Each Party shall notify the other of any complaint received by it in sufficient detail and within five (5) business days after the event, and in any event in sufficient time to allow the responsible Party to comply with any and all regulatory requirements imposed upon it in any country.
        
14.3    Adverse Drug Events.
    The Parties recognize that the holder of a Drug Approval Application may be required to submit information and file reports to various governmental agencies on compounds under clinical investigation, compounds proposed for marketing, or marketed drugs. Information must be submitted at the time of initial filing for investigational use in humans and at the time of a request for market approval of a new drug. In addition, supplemental information must be provided on compounds at periodic intervals and adverse drug experiences must be reported at more frequent intervals depending on the severity of the experience. Consequently, each Party agrees to:
        (a)   provide to the other for initial and/or periodic submission to government agencies significant information on the drug from preclinical laboratory, animal toxicology and pharmacology studies, as well as adverse drug experience reports from clinical trials and commercial experiences with the compound;
        (b)   in connection with investigational drugs, report to the other within three (3) days of the initial receipt of a report of any unexpected or serious experience with the drug, or sooner if required for either Party to comply with regulatory requirements; and
        (c)   in connection with marketed drugs, report to the other within five (5) business days of the initial receipt of a report of any adverse experience with the drug that is serious and unexpected or sooner if required for either Party to comply with regulatory requirements. Serious adverse experiences mean any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution, or any experience that is fatal or life threatening, is permanently disabling, requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, or is a congenital anomaly, cancer, or overdose. An unexpected adverse experience is one not identified in nature, specificity, severity or frequency in the current investigator brochure or the U.S. labeling for the drug. Each Party also agrees that if it contracts with a Third Party for research to be performed by such Third Party on the drug, that Party agrees to require such Third Party to report to contracting Party the information set forth in subparagraph (a), (b), and (c) above.
        
14.4    Records of Net Sales and Costs.
    Each Party will maintain complete and accurate records which are relevant to costs, expenses, sales and payments under this Agreement and such records shall be open during reasonable business hours for a period of three (3) years from creation of individual records for examination at the other Party's expense, and, with respect to the audit provisions of Section A.6.1 and A.6.2 of Exhibit A, such examination shall not be conducted more often than once each year by an independent public accountant selected by the other Party as described in A.6 of Exhibit A. Any records or accounting information received from the other Party shall be Confidential Information for purposes of Article 11. Results of any such audit shall be provided to both Parties, subject to Article 11.
        
14.5    Publicity Review.
    The Parties agree that the public announcement of the execution of this Agreement shall be in the form of a press release to be agreed upon on or before the Restated Effective Date and thereafter each Party shall be entitled to make or publish any public statement consistent with the contents thereof. Thereafter, IDEC and Genentech will jointly discuss and agree, based on the principles of this Section 14.5, on any statement to the public regarding this Agreement or any aspect of this Agreement subject in each case to disclosure otherwise required by law or regulation as determined in good faith by each Party. The principles to be observed by IDEC and Genentech in such public disclosures will be: accuracy, the requirements for confidentiality under Article 11, the advantage a competitor of IDEC or Genentech may gain from any public statements under this Section 14.5, and the standards and customs in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries for such disclosures by companies comparable to IDEC and Genentech. The terms of this Agreement may also be disclosed to (i) government agencies where required by law, or (ii) Third Parties with the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, so long as such disclosure is made under a binder of confidentiality and so long as highly sensitive terms and conditions such as financial terms are extracted from the Agreement or not disclosed upon the request of the other Party.
        
15.1    Term.
    This Agreement, which shall commence as of the Restated Effective Date, shall continue the collaboration contemplated by the Parties under the Original Agreement, including the First Amendment and Second Amendment thereto, as modified hereby. The Parties have specifically provided elsewhere in this Agreement the term during which certain rights and obligations hereunder shall apply. Unless sooner terminated as provided herein and except as provided in Section 15.2 below, (a) the remaining provisions of this Agreement relating to activities in the Co-Promotion Territory shall continue in effect until the date on which the Parties are no longer entitled to receive a share of Operating Profits or Losses on any Franchise Product and (b) the remaining provisions of this Agreement relating to activities in the Licensed Territory shall continue in effect until the date on which Genentech is no longer required to pay a royalty on Royalty-Bearing Sales in the Licensed Territory. Those provisions shall govern the term of the rights and obligations specifically covered thereby. Upon the expiration, but not an earlier termination, of this Agreement, all licenses granted by either Party to the other Party hereunder shall become fully paid up and irrevocable.
        
15.2    Sale or Purchase of Co-Promotion Rights on Change of Control.
    
        (a)   
Purchase Option with respect to all Franchise Products and Third Party Anti-CD20 Products
. Genentech may, by written notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to IDEC (the "Auction Notice"), indicate a single price (the "Auction Price") at which Genentech would be willing to purchase from IDEC all of the rights held by IDEC hereunder with respect to all Licensed Products in the Co-Promotion Territory (the "Purchase Option"). This right will be exercisable at any time if (i) a single stockholder or group of affiliated stockholders, other than Genentech or an Affiliate, who would be required to file a Schedule 13D under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, acquires or
obtains the right to acquire voting stock of IDEC so that its total holdings of such stock equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the then outstanding voting stock of IDEC, or (ii) a Third Party acquires or obtains the right to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of IDEC, in which case Genentech must exercise such right within ninety (90) days after the date on which such stockholder or group of stockholders passes the fifty percent (50%) threshold or the date of such acquisition. Either such event shall be referred to as a "Change of Control Event." IDEC shall promptly notify Genentech upon IDEC's receipt of written notice that such Change of Control Event will be occurring and shall use best efforts to ensure that such notice is given to Genentech at least ninety (90) days before the occurrence of such Change of Control Event. The Auction Price may be in the form of (i) cash, (ii) a royalty on sales of the Licensed Products in the Co-Promotion Territory or (iii) some combination of the foregoing. Concurrent with the initiation of an Auction Notice by Genentech under this Section 15.2, a royalty price (the "Royalty Price") at which Genentech will purchase from IDEC all of the rights held by IDEC hereunder with respect to all New Products (including G2H7), and Third Party Anti-CD20 Products for which IDEC entered into a written agreement with Genentech pursuant to Section 2.6 prior to such date, in the United States shall be set. The Royalty Price with respect to such New Products and Third Party Anti-CD20 Products shall be based on the
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]
of such product at the time of Genentech's written notice to IDEC under this Section 15.2 as follows:
It is understood and agreed that Genentech shall only be required to make Royalty Price payments on such New Products or Third Party Anti-CD20 Products (which were opted in by IDEC pursuant to Section 2.6 prior to the Auction Notice) which were under development pursuant to an approved or proposed Development Plan or being commercially sold at the time of such Auction Notice, and that subsequent development of any products incorporating any protein or peptide, other than the proteins or peptides that were incorporated into such New Products or Third Party Anti-CD20 Products, shall not be subject to such Royalty Price payments.
        (b)
    Sales Option with respect to all Licensed Products
.    Within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Auction Notice, IDEC shall notify Genentech in writing whether it elects to accept the Auction Price for its rights with respect to all Licensed Products or pay Genentech the Profit Sharing Ratio times the Auction Price for such Licensed Products (where "the Profit Sharing Ratio"
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]
, to purchase all of the rights held by Genentech hereunder with respect to Licensed Products in the Co-Promotion Territory (the "Sales Option"); provided, however, if IDEC does not notify Genentech of its election within such period, IDEC shall be deemed to have sold its rights hereunder with respect to the Licensed Products in the Co-Promotion Territory at the Auction Price under the Purchase Option. If Genentech has not received a response within twenty (20) days after Genentech sends its initial notice hereunder, Genentech shall on the twentieth (20th) day after sending such initial notice, deliver a second notice by certified mail, return receipt requested. For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that IDEC shall have no right under this Agreement to purchase any of the rights held by Genentech hereunder with respect to New Products, and/or Third Party Anti-CD20 Products for which IDEC entered into a written agreement with Genentech pursuant to Section 2.6 prior to such date.
        (c)   On that date which is thirty (30) days after receipt of the Auction Notice:
        (i)    all rights held by IDEC (including any successor in interest) under Section 2.5 and 2.6, other than with respect to New Products and/or Third Party Anti-CD20-Products for which IDEC entered into a written agreement with Genentech pursuant to Section 2.6 prior to such date, shall terminate;
        (ii)   all rights held by IDEC (including any successor in interest) hereunder with respect to New Products in the United States, and Third Party Anti-CD20 Products for which IDEC entered into a written agreement with Genentech pursuant to Section 2.6 prior to such date, including the right to receive further payments from Genentech shall terminate and Genentech shall thereafter pay IDEC the Royalty Price for each such product in the United States, without offset of any kind; such obligation to continue, on a product-by-product basis, for eleven (11) years from the date of first commercial sale of such product in the United States (for avoidance of doubt, a sale for "compassionate use" shall not be deemed a first commercial sale);
        (iii)  Genentech or its designee shall make its Royalty Price payments to IDEC or its designee quarterly within sixty (60) days following the end of each calendar quarter for which such payments are due. Each Royalty Price payment shall be accompanied by a report summarizing the Net Sales or Operating Profits (or Losses), as applicable, for such New Product or Third Party Anti-CD20 Product, during the relevant calendar quarter. IDEC shall have the right, upon written notice to Genentech, and not more often than once each calendar year, to have an independent accounting
firm, selected by IDEC and reasonably approved by Genentech, inspect Genentech's books of accounts for the sole purpose of verifying the correctness of calculations or such costs, expenses or payments made under this Section 15.2 with respect to sales of such products.

                On October 14, 2003, IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2003.  A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.  This Form 8-K and the attached exhibit are provided under Item 12, Results of Operation and Financial Condition, and are furnished to, but not filed with, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
 
                Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Dated: October 14, 2003
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
SAN DIEGO, California, (October 14, 2003):
IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Nasdaq: IDPH) today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2003.  Net income was $45.5 million, or $0.26 per share on a diluted basis, compared to $38.4 million, or $0.22 per share on a diluted basis, for the same period in 2002.
Total revenues for the third quarter ended September 30, 2003 were $138.5 million, compared to $103.7 million for the third quarter of 2002.  Revenues for the third quarter of 2003 included $134.0 million recorded for IDEC's joint business arrangement with Genentech for the commercialization of Rituxan (Rituximab), which IDEC copromotes in the U.S. with Genentech, compared to $98.6 million for the third quarter of 2002.  Revenues in the third quarter of 2003 also included $4.4 million in U.S. net sales of Zevalin (ibritumomab tiuxetan), which IDEC markets alone in the U.S. and was launched in April 2002, compared to $5.0 million for the third quarter of 2002.
Rituxan Revenues
U.S. net sales of Rituxan in the third quarter of 2003, as recorded by Genentech, were $354 million compared to $270 million for the same period in 2002.
"Rituxan sales produced another notable performance in the third quarter of this year,"  said William R. Rohn, IDEC's president and chief operating officer. "Net U.S. sales increased $84 million in the third quarter, representing a 31 percent increase from the same quarter last year."
 
The net sales of Rituxan reported by Genentech in the third quarter included $18 million of ex-U.S. sales to its partners F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. and Zenyaku Kogyo Co. Ltd. of Japan.  IDEC's royalty revenue on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. is based on Roche's and Zenyaku's end-user sales and is recorded with a one-quarter lag.  IDEC recognized, during the third quarter of 2003, $18.7 million in royalties from Roche's and Zenyaku's end-user sales during the second quarter of 2003.
 
Revenues from unconsolidated joint business reflect the financial results from the commercialization of Rituxan by IDEC and Genentech.  Revenues from unconsolidated joint business includes various revenues associated with Rituxan commercialization such as IDEC's share of pretax copromotion profits, reimbursements from Genentech for IDEC's Rituxan-related sales force and development expenses, and royalty revenues on sales of Rituximab outside the United States by Roche and Zenyaku.  Roche has
 
marketing rights to Rituximab outside of the U.S., and copromotes Rituxan in Japan with Zenyaku.
 
Operating Costs and Expenses
 
Operating costs and expenses for the third quarter of 2003 increased to $67.1 million from $49.4 million for the third quarter of 2002.  The higher 2003 operating expenses are primarily the result of increased legal expenses to protect IDEC's intellectual property rights, increased sales and marketing expenses to support commercialization of Zevalin, increased personnel and facility expenses, and increased research and development expenses due to decreased capitalization of IDEC's manufacturing costs, as our manufacturing facilities were primarily used to support products in development in the third quarter of 2003.
 
Cash Position
 
IDEC ended the third quarter of 2003 with cash, cash equivalents and securities available-for-sale totaling $1.5 billion.

Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
        On November 12, 2003, Bridges Merger Corporation ("Merger Sub"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant, was merged with and into Biogen, Inc. ("Biogen") with Biogen continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant (the "Merger"). At the same time, the Registrant filed an amendment to its certificate of incorporation to change its name to Biogen Idec Inc. The merger and name change were made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 20, 2003, by and among the Registrant, Merger Sub and Biogen (the "Merger Agreement"). At a special meeting of the Registrant's stockholders held on November 12, 2003, the issuance of the Registrant's common stock under the Merger Agreement and the Registrant's change of name were approved by the requisite vote of the Registrant's stockholders. In addition, at a special meeting of Biogen stockholders held on November 12, 2003, the Merger Agreement was approved by the requisite vote of Biogen's stockholders.
        As a result of the Merger, each share of Biogen common stock issued and outstanding at the effective time of the Merger, other than shares held by dissenting stockholders, was converted into the right to receive 1.15 (the "Exchange Ratio") shares of the Registrant's common stock. In addition, the Registrant assumed all options outstanding at the effective time of the Merger under Biogen's existing stock option plans. Each such option is now exercisable for a number of shares of the Registrant's common stock, and at an exercise price, adjusted to reflect the Exchange Ratio.
        Upon completion of the Merger, Biogen's common stock was delisted from the Nasdaq National Market. In connection with the Merger, the Registrant's common stock symbol on the Nasdaq National Market was changed from "IDPH" to "BIIB."
        The issuance of the Registrant's common stock under the Merger Agreement was registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Form S-4/A (File No. 333-107098) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The joint proxy statement/prospectus filed by the Registrant with the SEC on October 6, 2003 contains additional information about this transaction.
        A copy of the Merger Agreement is included as an exhibit to the Registrant's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 23, 2003 and is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the press release dated November 12, 2003 announcing the completion of the Merger is attached as exhibit 99.1 to this Report and is incorporated herein by reference. Also attached to this Report as exhibits 99.2 and 99.3, and incorporated herein by reference herein, are certain historical financial statements of Biogen.

The Board of Directors, in its discretion, may determine at the time that the unvested shares of Restricted Stock are issued or at any time thereafter that any or all of the Company's outstanding repurchase rights shall terminate, and that any or all shares subject to such terminated rights shall become vested in full, upon the occurrence of any Corporate Change in Control.
(iii)
The Committee shall have the discretionary authority, exercisable either before or after the Participant's termination of employment, to cancel the Company's outstanding repurchase rights with respect to any or all unvested shares of Restricted Stock purchased or purchasable by the Participant under the Plan and thereby accelerate the vesting of those shares in whole or in part at any time.
(e)

To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of shares of Common Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year under the Plan and any other stock option plan of the Company or an Affiliate shall exceed $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Nonqualified Stock Options. Such Fair Market Value shall be determined as of the date on which each such Incentive Stock Option is granted.
(f)
No Incentive Stock Option may be granted to a person if, at the time of the proposed grant, such person owns (or is deemed to own under the Code) stock possessing more than ten percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company unless (A) the exercise price of such Incentive Stock Option is at least 110% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock at the time such Incentive Stock Option is granted and (B) such Incentive Stock Option is not exercisable after the expiration of five years from the date such Incentive Stock Option is granted.

(h)
Effect of Termination of Employment
. Except as set forth in Section 12(c), (d) or (e) or as the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion may otherwise provide in the applicable Agreement, and subject to the Committee's authority under Section 4, upon the termination of a Participant's employment for any reason other than For Cause, any and all shares to which restrictions on transferability apply shall be immediately forfeited by the Participant and transferred to, and reacquired by, the Company together with any dividends paid on such shares; provided that if the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, shall within thirty (30) days after such termination of employment notify the Participant in writing of its decision not to terminate the Participant's rights in such shares, then the Participant shall continue to be the owner of such shares subject to such continuing restrictions as the Committee may prescribe in such notice. In the event of a forfeiture of shares pursuant to this section, the Company shall repay to the Participant any amount paid by the Participant for such shares. In the event that the Company requires a return of shares, it shall also have the right to require

(f)
Special Provisions Regarding Awards
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the vesting of Phantom Stock granted pursuant to this Section 9 to Covered

11.
Other Awards; Stock Appreciation Rights.
(a)
Other forms of Awards (including any Stock Appreciation Rights, hereinafter "Other Awards") valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, Common Stock may be granted either alone or in addition to other Awards under the Plan. Other Awards may be granted by the Committee in its discretion, provided that any such Other Award shall be granted only in lieu of salary or cash bonuses payable to the Participant and shall (except as otherwise provided in Section 12, 13 or 14 hereof or with respect to Stock Appreciation Rights granted in connection with an Option) have a Vesting Date not earlier than the first anniversary of the date of grant of the Award. Subject to the provisions of the Plan (including those set forth in the preceding sentence), the Committee shall have sole and complete authority to determine the persons to whom and the time or times at which such Other Awards shall be granted, the number of shares of Common Stock to be granted pursuant to such Other Awards and all other conditions of such Other Awards.
(b)
A Stock Appreciation Right may be granted in connection with an Option, either at the time of grant of the Option or at any time thereafter during the term of the Option, or may be granted unrelated to an Option.
(c)
A Stock Appreciation Right related to an Option shall require the holder, upon exercise, to surrender such Option with respect to the number of shares as to which such Stock Appreciation Right is exercised, in order to receive payment of any amount computed pursuant to Section 11(f). Such Option will, to the extent surrendered, then cease to be exercisable.
(d)
In the case of Stock Appreciation Rights granted in relation to Options, if the Appreciation Right covers as many shares as the related Option, the exercise of a related Option shall cause the number of shares covered by the Stock Appreciation Right to be reduced by the number of shares with respect to which the related Option is exercised. If the Stock Appreciation Right covers fewer shares than the related Option, when a portion of the related Option is exercised, the number of shares subject to the unexercised Stock Appreciation Right shall be reduced only to the extent necessary so that the number of remaining shares subject to the Stock Appreciation Right is not more than the remaining shares subject to the Option.
(e)
Subject to Section 11(k) and to such rules and restrictions as the Committee may impose, a Stock Appreciation Right granted in connection with an Option will be exercisable at such time or times, and only to the extent that a related Option is exercisable, and will not be transferable except to the extent that such related Option may be transferable.
(f)
Upon the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right related to an Option, the holder will be entitled to receive payment of an amount determined by multiplying:
(i)
The difference obtained by subtracting the option exercise price per share specified in the related Option from the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of exercise of such Stock Appreciation Right, by
(ii)
The number of shares as to which such Stock Appreciation Rights will have been exercised.
(g)
A Stock Appreciation Right granted without relationship to an Option will be exercisable as determined by the Committee but in no event after ten years from the date of grant.
(h)
A Stock Appreciation Right granted without relationship to an Option will entitle the holder, upon exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right, to receive payment of an amount determined by multiplying:
(i)
The difference obtained by subtracting the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date the Stock Appreciation Right is granted from the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of exercise of such Stock Appreciation Right, by
(ii)
The number of shares as to which such Stock Appreciation Rights will have been exercised.
(i)
Notwithstanding Sections 11(f) and 11(h) above, the Committee may place a limitation on the amount payable upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right. Any such limitation must be determined as of the date of grant and noted in the applicable Agreements.
(j)
Payment of the amount determined under Sections 11(f) and 11(h) above may be made solely in whole shares of Common Stock valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right or alternatively, in the sole discretion of the Committee, solely in cash or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock. If the Committee decides that full payment will be made in shares of Common Stock, and the amount payable results in a fractional share, payment for the fractional share will be made in cash.
(k)
The Committee may impose such additional conditions or limitations on the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right as it may deem necessary or desirable to secure for holders of Stock Appreciation Rights the benefits of Rule 16b-3, or any successor provision in effect at the time of grant or exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right or as it may otherwise deem advisable.
12.
Termination of Employment.
(a)
A Participant who ceases (for any reason other than death, total and permanent disability, Retirement or termination of employment For Cause) to be an Employee of the Company or of an Affiliate may exercise any Option, Stock Appreciation Right or Other Award to the extent that such Award has vested on the date of such cessation. Except as set forth in the next sentence or as otherwise set forth in the Plan, such Option, Stock Appreciation Right or Other Award shall be exercisable only within three (3) months after such date of cessation, or, if earlier, within the originally prescribed term of the Award, unless the Committee shall set forth a different period in the applicable Agreement. For purposes of the Plan, employment shall not be deemed terminated by reason of a transfer to another employer which is the Company or an Affiliate. If any Option, Stock Appreciation Right or Other Award is not exercised following the Participant's termination within the time specified, the Award shall terminate and the shares covered by such Option, Stock Appreciation Right or Other Award shall revert to the Plan.
(b)
A Participant whose employment with the Company or an Affiliate is terminated For Cause shall forthwith immediately upon notice of such termination cease to have any right to exercise any Option, Stock Appreciation Right or Other Award, and the Option, Stock Appreciation Right or Other Award shall terminate and the shares covered by such Option, Stock Appreciation Right or Other Award shall revert to the Plan. For purposes of the Plan, termination "For Cause" shall be deemed to include (and is not limited to) dishonesty with respect to the Company or any Affiliate, insubordination, substantial malfeasance or non-feasance of duty, unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, breach by a Participant of any provision of any employment, nondisclosure, non-competition or similar agreement between the Participant and the Company or any Affiliate, and conduct substantially prejudicial to the business of the Company or an Affiliate. The determination of the Committee as to the existence of circumstances warranting a termination For Cause shall be conclusive. Any definition in an agreement between a Participant and the Company or an Affiliate, which contains a conflicting definition of For Cause and which is in effect at the time of such termination, shall supersede the definition in the Plan with respect to the Participant.
(c)
If a Participant ceases to be an Employee of the Company or of an Affiliate by reason of total and permanent disability, as determined by the Committee in accordance with the provisions of this Section 12(c), any Award held by such person (or a permitted transferee of such person) on the date of disability shall be fully exercisable as of the date of such cessation. A disabled Participant (or a permitted transferee of such person) may exercise such Award only within a period of one (1) year after the date of such cessation or within such different period as may be determined by the Committee and set forth in the applicable Agreement, or, if earlier, within the originally prescribed term of the Award. If any Award is not exercised following the Participant's total and permanent disability within the time specified, the Award shall terminate and the shares covered by such Award shall revert to the Plan. For purposes of the Plan, a Participant shall be deemed to have a total and permanent disability if such Participant is entitled to receive benefits under the applicable long-term disability program of the Company or an Affiliate of the Company, or, if no such program is in effect with respect to such Participant, if the Participant has become totally and permanently disabled within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code.
(d)
If a Participant dies while the Participant is an Employee of the Company or of an Affiliate, any Award held by such person (or a permitted transferee of such person) at the date of death shall be fully exercisable as of the date of the Participant's death. A deceased Participant's legal representatives or one who acquires the Award by will or by the laws of descent and distribution (or a permitted transferee of such person) may exercise such Award only within a period of one (1) year after the date of death or within such different period as may be determined by the Committee and set forth in the applicable Agreement, or, if earlier, within the originally prescribed term of the award. If any Award is not exercised following the Participant's death within the time specified, the Award shall terminate and the shares covered by such Award shall revert to the Plan.
(e)
Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Agreement, immediately upon a Participant's Retirement, such person's then unvested Awards, including those held by a permitted transferee of such person, shall automatically accelerate and become fully vested for fifty percent (50%) of the number of shares covered by such unvested Awards and for an additional ten percent (10%) of the number of shares covered by such unvested Awards for every year of employment by the Company or any of its Affiliates beyond ten (10) years, up to the remaining amount of the unvested Award. Upon Retirement, a retired Participant (or permitted transferee of such person) may exercise any then outstanding Awards to the extent
vested only within a period of three (3) years after the date of Retirement or within such different period as may be determined by the Committee and set forth in the applicable Agreement or, if earlier, within the originally prescribed term of the Award. If any Award is not exercised following the Participant's Retirement within the time specified, the Award shall terminate and the shares covered by such Award shall revert to the Plan. For purposes of the Plan, the term "Retirement" as to any Employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates shall mean such person's leaving the employment of the Company and its Affiliates after reaching age 55 with ten (10) years of service with the Company or its Affiliates, but not including pursuant to any termination For Cause or pursuant to any termination for insufficient performance, as determined by the Company.
(f)
Leave of Absence
. A Participant to whom an Award has been granted under the Plan who is absent from work with the Company or with an Affiliate because of temporary disability, or who is on a permitted leave of absence for any purpose, shall not, during the period of any such absence, be deemed by virtue of such absence alone, to have terminated his employment with the Company or with an Affiliate except as the Committee may otherwise expressly provide in the applicable Agreement.
13.
Effect of Corporate Transaction.
(a)
Options
. In the event of a Corporate Transaction, the Committee shall, prior to the effective date of the Corporate Transaction, as to each outstanding Option under the Plan either (i) make appropriate provisions for the Options to be assumed by the successor corporation or its parent or be replaced with a comparable options to purchase shares of the capital stock of the successor corporation or its parent; or (ii) upon written notice to the Participants provide that all Options must be exercised and the Plan will terminate (all Options having been made fully exercisable as set forth below in this Section 13; or (iii) terminate all Options in exchange for a cash payment equal to the excess of the then aggregate Fair Market Value of the shares subject to such Options (all Options having been made fully exercisable as set forth below in this Section 13) over the aggregate option exercise price thereof. Each outstanding Option under the Plan which is assumed in connection with a Corporate Transaction or is otherwise to continue in effect shall be appropriately adjusted, immediately after such Corporate Transaction, to apply and pertain to the number and class of securities which would have been issued, in consummation of such Corporate Transaction, to an actual holder of the same number of shares of the Common Stock as are subject to such Option immediately prior to such Corporate Transaction. Appropriate adjustments shall also be made to the option exercise price payable per share, provided the aggregate option exercise price payable for such securities shall remain the same.
(b)
Other Awards
. In the event of a Corporate Transaction, the Committee shall, prior to the effective date of the Corporate Transaction, as to each outstanding Award (other than an Option) under the Plan either (i) make appropriate provisions for the Awards to be assumed by the successor corporation or its parent or be replaced with a comparable award with respect to the successor corporation or its parent; (ii) provide that such Awards shall be fully vested and exercisable, as applicable, prior to such Corporate Transaction and, to the extent that such Awards (other than awards of Restricted Stock) are not exercised prior to such Corporate Transaction, shall terminate upon the consummation of the Corporate Transaction; or (iii) terminate all such Awards in exchange for a cash payment equal to the then aggregate Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock and cash payments subject to such Award (all Awards having been made fully exercisable as set forth below in this Section 13), less any applicable exercise price.
(c)
Involuntary Employment Action
. If at any time within two (2) years of the effective date of a Corporate Transaction there is an Involuntary Employment Action with respect to any Designated Employee, each then outstanding Award assumed or replaced under this Section 13 and held by such Designated Employee (or a permitted transferee of such person) shall, upon the occurrence of such Involuntary Employment Action, automatically accelerate so that each such Award shall immediately become fully vested or exercisable, as applicable. Upon the occurrence of an Involuntary Employment Action with respect to a Designated Employee, any outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Right held by such Designated Employee (and a permitted transferee of such person) shall be exercisable within one (1) year of the Involuntary Employment Action or, if earlier, within the originally prescribed term of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right. An "Involuntary Employment Action" as to a Designated Employee shall mean the involuntary termination of the Designated Employee's employment with the Company or an Affiliate other than For Cause, or the termination by the Designated Employee of his employment with the Company and its Affiliates upon the occurrence, without the Participant's express written consent, of any of the following circumstances unless such circumstances are corrected (provided such circumstances are capable of correction): (i) any adverse and material alteration and diminution in the Participant's position, title or responsibilities (other than a mere change in title or reporting relationship) as they existed immediately prior to the Corporate Transaction or as the same may be increased from time to time thereafter, (ii) a reduction of the Participant's annual base salary or targeted bonus opportunity, in each case as in effect on the date prior to the Corporate Transaction or as the same may be increased from time to time thereafter, or (iii) relocation of the offices at which the Participant is employed which increases the Participant's daily commute by more than 100 miles on a round trip basis.
(d)
Determination of Comparability
. The determination of comparability under this Section 13 shall be made by the Committee and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive.
(e)
Other Adjustments
. The class and number of securities available for issuance under the Plan on both an aggregate and per participant basis shall be appropriately adjusted by the Committee to reflect the effect of the Corporate Transaction upon the Company's capital structure.
(f)
Termination of the Plan
. In the event the Company terminates the Plan or elects to cash out Options or Stock Appreciation Rights in accordance with clauses (ii) and (iii) of paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 13, then the exercisability of each affected Award outstanding under the Plan shall be automatically accelerated so that each such Award shall immediately prior to such Corporate Transaction, become fully vested and may be exercised prior to such Corporate Transaction for all or any portion of such Award. The Committee shall, in its discretion, determine the timing and mechanics required to implement the foregoing sentence.
14.
Acceleration Upon Corporate Change in Control.
        In the event of a Corporate Change in Control the exercisability or vesting of each Award outstanding under the Plan shall be automatically accelerated so that each such Award shall immediately prior to such Corporate Change in Control, become fully vested or exercisable for the full number of shares of the Common Stock purchasable or cash payable under an Award to the extent not previously exercised and may be exercised for all or any portion of such shares or cash within the originally prescribed term of such Award. The Committee shall, in its discretion, determine the timing and mechanics required to implement the foregoing sentence. However, an outstanding Award under the Plan shall not be accelerated under this Section 14 if and to the extent one or more limitations imposed by the Committee at the time of grant preclude such acceleration upon a Corporate Change in Control.
15.
Rights as a Stockholder.
        No person shall have any rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares of Common Stock covered by or relating to any Award until the date of issuance of a stock certificate with respect to such shares. Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 3(c), no adjustment to any Award shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date occurs prior to the date such stock certificate is issued.
16.
No Employment Rights; No Right to Award.
        Nothing contained in the Plan or any Agreement shall confer upon any Participant any right with respect to the continuation of employment by the Company or an Affiliate or interfere in any way with the right of the Company or an Affiliate, subject to the terms of any separate employment agreement to the contrary, at any time to terminate such employment or to increase or decrease the compensation of the Participant. No person shall have any claim or right to receive an Award hereunder. The Committee's granting of an Award to a Participant at any time shall neither require the Committee to grant any other Award to such Participant or other person at any time or preclude the Committee from making subsequent grants to such Participant or any other person.
17.
Securities Matters.
(a)
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be obligated to cause to be issued or delivered any certificates evidencing shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Plan unless and until the Company is advised by its counsel that the issuance and delivery of such certificates is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations of governmental authority and the requirements of any securities exchange on which shares of Common Stock are traded. The Committee may require, as a condition of the issuance and delivery of certificates evidencing shares of Common Stock pursuant to the terms hereof, that the recipient of such shares make such agreements and representations, and that such certificates bear such legends, as the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or desirable.
(b)
The transfer of any shares of Common Stock hereunder shall be effective only at such time as counsel to the Company shall have determined that the issuance and delivery of such shares is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations of governmental authority and the requirements of any securities exchange on which shares of Common Stock are traded. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, defer the effectiveness of any transfer of shares of Common Stock hereunder in order to allow the issuance of such shares to be made pursuant to registration or an exemption from registration or other methods for compliance available under federal or state securities laws. The Committee shall inform the Participant (or a permitted transferee of such person) in writing of its decision to defer the effectiveness of a transfer. During the period of such deferral in connection with the exercise of an Option, the Participant (or a permitted transferee of such person) may, by written notice, withdraw such exercise and obtain the refund of any amount paid with respect thereto.
18.
Withholding Taxes.
        Whenever cash is to be paid pursuant to an Award, the Company or Affiliate by which the Participant is employed shall have the right to deduct therefrom an amount sufficient to satisfy any federal, state and local withholding tax requirements related thereto. Whenever shares of Common Stock are to be delivered pursuant to an Award, the Company shall have the right to require the Participant to remit to the Company or Affiliate by which the Participant is employed in cash an amount sufficient to satisfy any federal, state and local withholding tax requirements related thereto. With the approval of the Committee, a Participant may satisfy the foregoing requirement by electing to have the Company withhold from delivery shares of Common Stock having a value equal to the minimum amount of tax required to be withheld. Such shares shall be valued at their Fair Market
Value on the date of which the amount of tax to be withheld is determined. Fractional share amounts shall be settled in cash. Such a withholding election may be made with respect to all or any portion of the shares to be delivered pursuant to an Award.
19.
Notification of Election Under Section 83(b) of the Code.
        If any Participant shall, in connection with the acquisition of shares of Common Stock under the Plan, make the election permitted under Section 83(b) of the Code, such Participant shall notify the Company of such election within 10 days of filing notice of the election with the Internal Revenue Service.
20.
Notification Upon Disqualifying Disposition Under Section 421(b) of the Code.
        Each Agreement with respect to an Incentive Stock Option shall require the Participant to notify the Company of any disposition of shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the exercise of such Option under the circumstances described in Section 421(b) of the Code (relating to certain disqualifying dispositions), within 10 days of such disposition.
21.
Amendment or Termination of the Plan.
        No amendment to the Plan which (i) increases the number of shares of Common Stock issuable under the Plan (ii) materially changes the class of persons eligible to participate in the Plan, (iii) would have the effect of materially increasing the benefits accruing under the Plan to Participants or (iv) materially alters the provisions of the second paragraph of Section 4 shall be effective without approval by the stockholders of the Company. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, the Board of Directors may, at any time, suspend or terminate the Plan or revise or amend it in any respect whatsoever; provided, however, that stockholder approval shall also be required for any such amendment if and to the extent the Board of Directors determines that such approval is appropriate for purposes of satisfying Sections 162(m) or 422 of the Code or Rule 16b-3 or other applicable law or the requirements of any securities exchange upon which the securities of the Company trade. Nothing herein shall restrict the Committee's ability to exercise its discretionary authority pursuant to Section 4, which discretion may be exercised without amendment to the Plan. No action hereunder may, without the consent of a Participant, reduce the Participant's rights under any outstanding Award.
22.
Transferability.
        Awards granted under the Plan shall not be transferable by a participant other than (i) by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, or (ii) with respect to Awards other than Incentive Stock Options, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, as defined by the Code or Title 1 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or the rules thereunder, or (iii) as otherwise determined by the Committee. The designation of a beneficiary of an Award by a Participant shall not be deemed a transfer prohibited by this Section. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, an Award shall be exercisable, during a Participant's lifetime, only by the Participant (or by his or her legal representative) and shall not be assigned, pledged, or hypothecated in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) and shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempted transfer, assignment, pledge, hypothecation, or other disposition of any Award contrary to the provisions of this Section 22, or the levy of any attachment or similar process upon an Award, shall be null and void. Upon the death of a Participant, outstanding Awards granted to such Participant may be exercised only by the executor or administrator of the Participant's estate or by a person who shall have acquired the right to such exercise by will or by the laws of descent and distribution (or by a permitted transferee of such person). No transfer of an Award by will or the laws of descent and distribution, or as otherwise permitted by this Section 22, shall be effective to bind the Company unless the Committee shall have been furnished with (a) written notice thereof and with a copy of the will and/or such evidence as the Committee may deem necessary to establish the validity of the transfer and (b) an agreement by the transferee to comply with all the terms and conditions of the Award that are or would have been
applicable to the Participant and to be bound by the acknowledgments made by the Participant in connection with the grant of the Award.
23.
Dissolution or Liquidation of the Company.
        Upon the dissolution or liquidation of the Company other than in connection with transactions to which Section 13 is applicable, all Awards granted hereunder shall terminate and become null and void; provided, however, that if the rights hereunder of a Participant or one who acquired an Award by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, or as otherwise permitted by Section 22, have not otherwise terminated and expired, the Participant or such person shall have the right immediately prior to such dissolution or liquidation to exercise any Award granted hereunder to the extent that the right to exercise such Award has accrued as of the date immediately prior to such dissolution or liquidation. Awards of Restricted Stock that have not vested as of the date of such dissolution or liquidation shall be forfeited as of the date of such dissolution or liquidation.
24.
Effective Date and Term of Plan.
        The Plan shall be subject to the requisite approval of the stockholders of the Company. In the absence of such approval, any Awards shall be null and void. Unless extended or earlier terminated by the Board of Directors, the right to grant Awards under the Plan shall terminate on the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date. No extension of the Plan shall operate to permit the grant of Incentive Stock options following the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date. Awards outstanding at Plan termination shall remain in effect according to their terms and the provisions of the Plan.
25.
Applicable Law.
        The Plan shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the law of the State of Delaware, without reference to its principles of conflicts of law.
26.
Participant Rights.
        No Participant shall have any claim to be granted any award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment for Participants.
27.
Unfunded Status of Awards.
        The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan for incentive and deferred compensation. With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant pursuant to an Award, nothing contained in the Plan or any Agreement shall give any such Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company.
28.
No Fractional Shares.
        No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan. The Committee shall determine whether cash, other Awards, or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu of such fractional shares or whether such fractional shares or any rights thereto shall be forfeited or otherwise eliminated.
29.
Beneficiary.
        A Participant may file with the Committee a written designation of a beneficiary on such form as may be prescribed by the Committee and may, from time to time, amend or revoke such designation. If no designated beneficiary survives the Participant, the executor or administrator of the Participant's estate shall be deemed to be the Participant's beneficiary.
30.
Interpretation.
        The Plan is designed and intended to comply, to the extent applicable, with Section 162(m) of the Code, and all provisions hereof shall be construed in a manner to so comply.
31.
Severability.
        If any provision of the Plan is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of the Plan shall not be affected but shall be applied as if the invalid or unenforceable provision had not been included in the Plan.

Exhibit 10.74
I.
Purpose
        This Performance Based Management Incentive Plan (the "Plan") is maintained by IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation (the "Company") to:
A.
Attract and retain persons of outstanding competence.
B.
Stimulate outstanding effort to bring about exceptional operating performance and reward the contributors to this performance by providing them with a share of the resulting benefits.
        The Plan is intended to supplement a person's base salary and result in total cash compensation for above average performance that exceeds the average compensation levels of comparable companies. Incentive awards paid under the Plan are intended to satisfy the "qualified performance-based compensation" requirements of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
II.
Basic Concepts
        Since the purpose of the Plan is to stimulate and reward outstanding performance in the accomplishment of specific objectives, the Plan should generally be formally integrated with the objectives of the total management system. The Plan should thus support a continuing and meaningful emphasis on the effective use of goal setting and management by objectives and generally should be aligned with the goals reflected in the approved annual plan of the Company.
        Annual incentive award programs under the Plan shall be developed under the following basic concepts:
A.
The advance identification of the participants in the Plan and the establishment of target incentive awards, specific performance goals and the extent to which each such objective shall determine the actual award.
B.
The establishment of a range in the actual incentive awards available under the Plan to reflect the achievements of the respective participants as well as the achievement of the Company-wide performance goals.
III.
Eligibility
A.
Participation in the Plan shall be limited to executive officers of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates and certain other key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries nominated by the Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO") and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee"), or selected by the Compensation Committee (each employee participating in the Plan a "Participant").
B.
Unless otherwise specifically authorized by the Compensation Committee, persons approved for participation in the Plan (each employee participating in the Plan a "Participant") shall be excluded from participation in any other cash bonus or incentive program of the Company or its subsidiaries and affiliates.
IV.
Basis of Participation
A.
Participants may receive incentive awards under the Plan on the basis of percentages established in advance as recommended by the CEO and approved by the Compensation Committee as part of the annual compensation plan, or as established by the Compensation Committee.
B.
The target incentive award for a Participant shall be developed in accordance with the following:
        1.     In connection with the planning of their performance goals for the plan year, the CEO shall recommend (for approval by the Compensation Committee), or the Compensation Committee shall establish, the individual Participants and the target incentive award for each Participant (expressed as a percentage of the annual base pay of the Participant).
        2.     The target incentive award for each Participant (expressed as a percentage of annual base pay of the Participant) shall be established in accordance with guidelines established by the Compensation Committee.
        (a)   Because of the many variables in establishing base salary structures, the Plan does not contemplate achieving any degree of uniformity in the relationship of incentive awards to annual base pay. Therefore, the range of target incentive awards will be rather broad. Individual target incentive awards should be based upon consideration of:
        (i)    relative significance of the individual's function in directly influencing the performance of the Company;
        (ii)   the target incentive awards for individuals in similar roles at competing companies; and
        (iii)  the relative competitive total compensation for the respective positions.
C.
Each plan year, the Compensation Committee shall establish a formula for determining the amount of incentive award a Participant may receive and such formula shall specify the Participants or class of Participants to which such formula applies. Generally, a formula established by the Compensation Committee shall reflect both (1) Company-wide goals ("Corporate Goals") which generally should be based on key elements of the Company's annual plan and (2) specific goals relating to the performance of the respective Participant ("Individual Goals"). Corporate Goals and Individual Goals shall be objective and the formula shall be objective and state the method for computing the amount that may be paid to a Participant if the performance goal or goals are attained. A formula established by the Compensation Committee may provide that if certain specified goals are not met, no incentive awards will be awarded under the Plan for the plan year to which such formula applies.
D.
Subject to Sections VII.C, VIII.B, VIII.C and VIII.D, the actual incentive award to a Participant under the Plan shall be computed according to the formula determined pursuant to Section IV.C; provided, however, that the Compensation Committee shall have the discretion to decrease the amount of the incentive award payable. A Participant may receive an incentive award that is less than, equal to or greater than his or her target incentive award provided, however, that the calculation shall not be discretionary but rather shall be pursuant to an objective formula for computing the amount of compensation payable to the Participant if the applicable performance goals are attained.
E.
Individual Goals shall be established as follows:
        1.     Individual Goals shall be based on one or more of the business criteria set forth in Section V.B and shall relate to significant and measurable areas that require special attention during the plan year. The purpose is to add special emphasis to those particular activities and reward for their accomplishments. From year-to-year, it is expected that the emphasis will change both in relation to the selected Individual Goals as well as to the importance of such goals in determining the actual incentive award.
        2.     Individual Goals shall be precise in establishing the targets and the basis for measurement of accomplishment, and if there can be variations in the degree of accomplishment of an individual
goal, the extent to which such goal will be considered satisfied upon attainment of the levels of accomplishment shall be clearly stated.
        3.     Where Individual Goals relate to dollar objectives, they should be identified with or reconciled to amounts reflected in the Company's approved annual operating plan.
V.
Code Section 162(m) Requirements
A.
Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, incentive awards shall be paid solely on account of the attainment of one or more objective performance goals which (1) are pre-established by the Compensation Committee, (2) are based on one or more of the business criteria listed below in Section V.B, and (3) state, in terms of an objective formula or standard, the method for computing the amount of compensation payable to a Participant if the goal is attained; provided, however, that incentive awards may also be paid in accordance with Section VIII.B.
B.
Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, performance goals shall be based on one or more of the following business criteria: revenue growth; earnings per share; return on capital employed; profits after taxes; total return to stockholder and earnings before any one or more of the following items: interest, taxes, depreciation or amortization; operating income; cash flow; return on equity; return on invested capital; return on assets; cost reductions or savings; funds from operations; appreciation in the market value of Company common stock; progress on the Company's product pipeline; research productivity; movement of programs from research to development; product development; product market share; in-licensing and/or out-licensing; mergers and/or acquisitions; sales of assets and/or subsidiaries; litigation; information services related projects; employee turnover and/or other human resources activities; manufacturing quality; production measures; inventory levels; supply chain management; support services; site, plant, building and/or facility development; government relations; management and board of directors composition; leadership development and/or talent management.
C.
Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the calculation of an incentive award (including any increase above the target incentive award but excluding any decrease in the award payable) shall not be discretionary but rather shall be pursuant to an objective formula for computing the amount of incentive award payable to a Participant if the applicable goals are attained.
D.
Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, to the extent necessary to comply with the qualified performance-based compensation requirements of Code Section 162(m), award formulas shall be adopted in each performance period by the Compensation Committee no later than the latest time permitted by Code Section 162(m) (generally, for performance periods of one year or more, no later than 90 days after the commencement of the performance period). No incentive awards shall be paid to Participants unless and until the Compensation Committee makes a certification in writing with respect to the attainment of the performance goals with respect to such incentive award as required by Code Section 162(m). Although the Compensation Committee may in its sole discretion reduce an incentive award payable to a Participant pursuant to the applicable formula, subject to Section VIII.B the Compensation Committee shall have no discretion to increase the amount of a Participant's incentive award as determined under the applicable formula.
VI.
Administration
A.
The overall administration of the Plan shall be under the direction of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee shall consist solely of two or more members of the Company's Board of Directors who qualify as "outside directors" for purposes of Code Section 162(m).
B.
Responsibility for the operating administration of the Plan shall be under the direction of the Company's senior human resources officer.
VII.
Determination of Incentive Awards
A.
Promptly following the close of a plan year, the respective managers shall evaluate the performance of the Participants, determine the extent to which Individual Goals were achieved (in terms of percentage achievement, subject to a maximum percentage established annually by the Compensation Committee, which in no event shall be more than 225%) and, with assistance from the Company's chief human resources officer, forward a report on such evaluations and determinations to the Compensation Committee for review and approval. In all cases, the extent to which Individual Goals were achieved shall be determined only after a self-assessment has been completed.
B.
The final determination of the extent to which Corporate Goals were achieved (in terms of percentage achievement, subject to a maximum percentage established annually by the Compensation Committee, which in no event shall be more than 225%) will be made by the Compensation Committee, promptly following the availability of year-end financial and technical results.
C.
Subject to the limitation that the maximum amount payable under the Plan to any employee during any calendar year may not exceed $3,500,000 and subject to Sections IV.D, VIII.B, VIII.C and VIII.D, incentive awards to Participants shall be computed according to the formula established under Section IV.C, using, to the extent applicable to such formula, the percent achievement determined in accordance with Section VII.A and the percent achievement determined in accordance with Section VII.B.
VIII.
Payments, Termination of Employment and General Conditions
A.
Subject to Section VIII.C and VIII.D, payments to Participants who have been determined to be entitled to incentive awards shall be made in cash generally not later than the fifteenth day of the third calendar month following the close of the Company's fiscal year.
B.
A Participant must be employed by the Company on the last day of a plan year to be eligible for an incentive award. A Participant whose employment with the company is terminated prior to the end of a plan year due to death, disability or a change of ownership or control of the Company may receive an incentive award at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. A Participant whose employment with the Company is terminated for any reason other than death, disability or a change of ownership or control of the Company may receive an incentive award at the discretion of the Compensation Committee only if the applicable performance goals were attained prior to such termination.
C.
While it is the intent of the Company to continue the Plan during any year for which it is established and to make incentive awards to Participants in accordance with these policies and guidelines, the Company reserves the right to amend, modify or terminate the Plan, any annual incentive program under the Plan or any Participant's participation in the Plan at any time or on such conditions as the Compensation Committee shall deem appropriate; provided, however, that once the Compensation Committee has established the performance goals underlying an incentive award the Compensation Committee may not change either such performance goals or the formula for computing whether such goals were met and the Compensation Committee may not increase the amount of the target incentive award (the Compensation Committee may, however, decrease the amount of a Participant's actual incentive award). No Participant shall have any right to any incentive award under the Plan until such award and the amount thereof has been finally approved by the Compensation Committee and communicated to such Participant after the end of the plan year for which the award is being made.
D.
No incentive awards shall be paid under the Plan unless and until the material terms of the performance goals under which incentive awards may be paid have been approved by the Company's stockholders as required by Section 162(m) of the Code. So long as the Plan shall not have been previously terminated by the Company, the material terms of the performance goals under which incentive awards may be paid shall be resubmitted for approval by the Company's stockholders in the fifth year after the material terms of the performance goals under which incentive awards may be paid shall have first been approved by the Company's stockholders and every fifth year thereafter. In addition, the material terms of the performance goals under which incentive awards may be paid shall be resubmitted to the Company's stockholders for approval if the Plan is amended in any way which changes the persons eligible under the Plan, the business criteria listed in Section V.B, the maximum amount of compensation which may be paid to any Participant under the Plan in any calendar year, or the material terms of the performance goals.
E.
A Participant may designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries who, in the event of the Participant's death, shall receive payment of any incentive award that may be determined under Section VIII.B. Such designation shall be made by the Participant on a form prescribed by the Compensation Committee. The Participant may, at any time, change or revoke such designation. A beneficiary designation, or revocation of a prior beneficiary designation, will be effective only if it is made in writing on a form provided by the Compensation Committee, signed by the Participant and received by the Company. If a Participant does not designate a beneficiary or the beneficiary dies prior to receiving any payment of an incentive award, awards payable under the Plan otherwise to a beneficiary shall be paid to the Participant's estate. Submission of a beneficiary designation form and its receipt by the Company does not in any way alter or diminish the discretionary authority granted to the Compensation Committee under Section VIII.B.
F.
The Plan is not a contract between the Company and any Participant. Neither the establishment of the Plan, nor any action taken hereunder, shall be construed as giving any Participant any right to be retained in the employ of the Company. The Company is under no obligation to continue the Plan.
G.
A Participant's right and interest under the Plan may not be assigned or transferred, except as provided in Section VIII.E, and any attempted assignment or transfer shall be null and void and shall extinguish, in the Company's sole discretion, the Company's obligation under the Plan to pay incentive awards with respect to the Participant.
H.
The Plan shall be unfunded. The Company shall not be required to establish any special or separate fund, or to make any other segregation of assets, to assure payment of awards.
I.
The Company shall have the right to deduct from incentive awards paid any taxes or other amounts required by law to be withheld.
J.
It is the intent of the Company that the Plan and incentive awards under the Plan comply with the applicable provisions of Section 162(m) of the Code. To the extent that any legal requirement of Section 162(m) of the Code as set forth in the Plan ceases to be required under Section 162(m) of the Code, that Plan provisions shall cease to apply.
K.
The validity, construction, interpretation and effect of the Plan shall exclusively be governed by and determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions.

Exhibit 99.1
CAMBRIDGE, MA, and SAN DIEGO, CA, NOVEMBER 12, 2003IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Biogen, Inc. announced today that they have completed their merger transaction, creating a new global biotechnology industry leader, with top products and capabilities in oncology and immunology.
Stockholders of both companies approved the merger and merger-related proposals at special meetings held today, and all regulatory approvals and closing conditions have been satisfied. The combined company, Biogen Idec Inc., will commence trading on NASDAQ tomorrow under the stock symbol "BIIB."
"We are excited to begin our new life as Biogen Idec and to capitalize on the momentum we have generated as individual companies and in our work planning for a unified organization," said William H. Rastetter, Ph.D., the company's Executive Chairman. "Based on our existing collaboration in oncology, we knew that this combination would be an excellent fit, both operationally and culturally. Yet it still has been gratifying to witness the realization of this vision over the past five months during our integration planning process."
Biogen Idec begins operations with several impressive features, including:
 - 
Strong franchises in oncology and immunology, supported by centers of excellence in San Diego and Cambridge;
 - 
A diverse product portfolio and revenue base, with two blockbuster drugs, AVONEX (Interferon beta-1a) and RITUXAN (rituximab), and 10 products in clinical development;
 - 
An aggressive drug development program, with initiatives focused on making Biogen Idec a strategic partner for companies seeking to develop promising new therapies;
 - 
A strong commitment to pioneering new standards of care through an expected annual R&D budget of more than $550 million and 1,000 dedicated R&D employees, including approximately 400 in discovery research; and
 - 
Global reach, including operations in 16 European countries, as well as Japan, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. A vast network of distributors sells Biogen Idec products in over 50 countries.
"Since the announcement of our proposed merger in June, our lead products AVONEX and RITUXAN have performed exceptionally well, and we have continued to mark progress in our combined late-stage pipeline," said James C. Mullen, Biogen Idec's Chief Executive Officer. "In addition, Biogen Idec will leverage strategic assetsincluding $1.5 billion in net cash and manufacturing expertise and capacityto achieve our goal of in-licensing approximately 50 percent of our pipeline by 2010."
Biogen Idec's pipeline of products in development includes ANTEGREN (natalizumab), which, in partnership with Elan Corporation plc, is in Phase III clinical studies for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease; RITUXAN which is in Phase III trials for rheumatoid arthritis and other cancer indications; the second-generation oral fumarate, which is in Phase III clinical trials in Europe; and an anti-CD23 antibody, which will soon enter Phase II trials for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
The company will begin with a balance sheet of more than $1.5 billion in net cash, and a commitment toward delivering on each of the financial goals it has articulated since the merger was announced. The company expects to achieve 15 percent compound annual revenue growth and approximately 20 percent compound annual cash earnings per share growth through 2007, and to generate cumulative operating expense synergies of over $300 million and cumulative capital expenditure synergies of over $175 million through 2007.
The Board of Directors of Biogen Idec will consist of 12 directors, six from each company, including Mr. Mullen and Dr. Rastetter. Dr. Rastetter will serve as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. The 10 non-employee Board members are Alan Belzer, Lawrence C. Best, Alan B. Glassberg, M.D., Mary L. Good, Ph.D., Thomas F. Keller, Robert W. Pangia, Bruce R. Ross, the Honorable Lynn Schenk, Phillip A. Sharp, Ph.D. and William D. Young.
In addition to Dr. Rastetter and Mr. Mullen, Biogen Idec's executive officers are:
 - 
Burt A. Adelman, M.D., Executive Vice President, Development;
 - 
Thomas J. Bucknum, Executive Vice President, General Counsel, and Secretary;
 - 
John M. Dunn, Executive Vice President, New Ventures;
 - 
Nabil Hanna, Ph.D., Executive Vice President, Research;
 - 
Peter N. Kellogg, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer;
 - 
Connie Matsui, Executive Vice President, Corporate Strategy and Communication;
 - 
William R. Rohn, Chief Operating Officer; and
 - 
Craig E. Schneier, Ph.D., Executive Vice President, Human Resources
As a result of the merger, each share of Biogen common stock was converted into the right to receive 1.15 shares of Biogen Idec common stock.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Biogen, Inc. and Subsidiaries
1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Business
        Biogen, Inc. ("Biogen" or the "Company") is a global biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and markets novel human therapeutic products. Biogen's primary focus is developing pharmaceutical products that meet unmet medical needs particularly in its core therapeutic areas of neurology, dermatology and rheumatology. Biogen currently sells AVONEX (Interferon beta-1a) for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis ("MS") and, commencing in 2003, AMEVIVE (alefacept) for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Biogen also receives revenues from royalties on sales by our licensees of a number of products covered under patents that Biogen controls. In addition, Biogen has a pipeline of development stage products and a number of research programs in our core therapeutic areas and in other areas of interest. Certain items in prior years' financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.
Principles of Consolidation
        The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Additionally, the Company maintains a 50% equity interest in two joint ventures outside the U.S. The primary purpose of these entities is the distribution of AVONEX in Switzerland and AMEVIVE in Italy. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The Company records its share of the earnings or losses of these entities to other income (expense).
Use of Estimates
        The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgements that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition and bad debts, marketable securities, derivatives and hedging activities, inventories, patents, income taxes, research and development, loans, pensions, contingencies and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Translation of Foreign Currencies
        The functional currency for most of the Company's foreign subsidiaries is the local currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at current rates of exchange. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the year. Adjustments resulting from the translation of the financial statements of the Company's foreign operations into U.S. dollars are excluded from the determination of net income and are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders' equity. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company's subsidiaries which have the U.S. dollar as the functional currency are remeasured into U.S. dollars using current rates of exchange for monetary assets and liabilities and historical rates of exchange for nonmonetary assets. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are included in the results of operations in other income, net. The Company had foreign exchange gains totaling $2.2 million in 2002, and foreign exchange losses of $1.2 million and $2.8 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
        The Company considers only those investments, which are highly liquid, readily convertible to cash and which mature within three months from date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
        The carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other, approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities. Marketable securities are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices, consistent with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities". The fair values of trading securities, interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts are based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. The Company's long-term debt approximates fair value.
Inventories
        Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first-in/first-out ("FIFO") method. Included in inventory are raw materials used in the production of pre-clinical and clinical products which are expensed as research and development costs when consumed. The components of inventories for the periods ending December 31, are as follows:
        Biogen capitalizes inventory costs associated with certain products prior to regulatory approval, based on management's judgment of probable future commercialization. Biogen would be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre-approval inventory upon a change in such judgment, due to, among other potential factors, a denial or delay of approval by necessary regulatory bodies. At December 31, 2002, capitalized inventory related to AMEVIVE, which received regulatory approval in the U.S. in January 2003, was $25 million. At December 31, 2002, capitalized inventory related to pre-filled syringe formulation of AVONEX, which has not yet received regulatory approval, was $3.7 million.
        Biogen writes down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual realizable value is less than that estimated by Biogen, additional inventory write-downs may be required. The Company wrote down $6.8 million of unmarketable inventory during 2002, of which $4.2 million was charged to research and development expense for product not yet commercialized, and the remainder was charged to cost of product revenues. The Company did not have any material writedowns of inventory for the years ended December 31, 2001 or 2000.
Marketable Securities
        The Company invests its excess cash balances in short-term marketable securities, principally corporate notes and government securities. At December 31, 2002, substantially all of the Company's securities were classified as "available-for-sale". All available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair market value and unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity, net of related tax effects. Realized gains and losses and declines in value, if
any, judged to be other than temporary on available-for-sale securities are reported in other income or expense.
        As part of its strategic product development efforts, the Company invests in equity securities of certain biotechnology companies with which it has collaborative agreements. As a matter of policy, Biogen determines on a quarterly basis whether any decline in the fair value of a marketable security is temporary or other than temporary. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities are included in other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity, net of related tax effects. If a decline in the fair value of a marketable security below the Company's cost basis is determined to be other than temporary, such marketable security is written down to its estimated fair value with a charge to current earnings. The factors that the Company considers in its assessments include the fair market value of the common stock, the duration of the stock's decline, prospects for favorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives and new collaborative agreements.
        The Company also invests in equity securities of certain companies whose securities are not publicly traded and fair value is not readily available. These investments are recorded using the cost method of accounting and, as a matter of policy, the Company monitors these investments in private securities on a quarterly basis and determines whether any impairment in their value would require a charge to current earnings.
Property and Equipment
        Property and equipment is carried at cost, subject to review of impairment for significant assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful life or the term of the respective lease. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Buildings and equipment are depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging from 15 to 40 and 3 to 20 years, respectively. The Company capitalizes certain incremental costs associated with the validation effort required for licensing by the FDA of manufacturing equipment for the production of a commercially approved drug. These costs include primarily direct labor and material and are incurred in preparing the equipment for its intended use. The validation costs are amortized over the life of the related equipment.
Patents
        The costs associated with successful patent defenses and patent applications are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives up to 15 years. Accumulated amortization of patent costs was $11.3 million and $15.7 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The carrying value of patents is regularly reviewed by the Company and impairments are recognized when the expected future operating cash flows derived from the patent is less than their carrying value. For the year ending December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 the Company wrote off certain of its patents, which resulted in a charge of $2 million in 2002.
Loans
        In connection with certain of its research collaborations, the Company has extended loans or made loan commitments to collaborators. On a quarterly basis, the loans are monitored for potential impairment, based on the probability of the collection of the full amount due under the loan according to each loan's terms. Should it be determined that it is not probable that the Company will be able to collect all interest and principal due, the Company recognizes a corresponding impairment charge to current earnings.
Derivatives and Hedging Activities
        Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", ("SFAS 133") requires that all derivatives be recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction. The Company assesses, both at its inception and on an on-going basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of hedged items. The Company assesses hedge ineffectiveness on a quarterly basis and records the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion to current earnings to the extent significant. If the Company determines that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, the Company discontinues hedge accounting for the affected portion of the hedge instrument, and any related unrealized gain or loss on the contract is recognized in current earnings.
Comprehensive Income
        Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income", ("SFAS 130"), requires the display of comprehensive income and its components as part of the Company's full set of financial statements. Comprehensive income is comprised of net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income includes certain changes in equity that are excluded from net income, such as translation adjustments and unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale marketable securities and certain derivative instruments, net of tax. The Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity reflect comprehensive income for years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 of $205.7 million, $259.8 million and $310.3 million, respectively.
        In accordance with SFAS 133, the Company records an adjustment to other comprehensive income to recognize at fair value all derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments, which comprised unrealized gains or losses related to the Company's interest rate swaps. During 2000, the Company recorded $1.5 million of unrealized losses, net of tax to other comprehensive income reflecting the decrease in the fair value of the interest rate swaps and at December 31, 2000 had a cumulative unrealized loss, net of tax, of $1.1 million. During 2001, the Company recorded $1 million of unrealized losses, net of tax to other comprehensive income reflecting the decrease in the fair value of the interest rate swaps and at December 31, 2001 had a cumulative unrealized loss, net of tax, of $2.1 million. During 2002, the Company recorded $1.2 million of unrealized losses, net of tax to other comprehensive income reflecting the decrease in the fair value of the interest rate swaps and at December 31, 2002 had a cumulative unrealized loss, net of tax, of $3.3 million.
        The Company has foreign currency forward contracts to hedge specific transactions denominated in foreign currencies. During 2000, the fair value of the Company's foreign currency forward contracts decreased by $5.3 million. At December 31, 2000, the Company had cumulative unrealized gains, net of tax, of $1.4 million on its foreign currency forward contracts. During 2001, the fair value of the Company's foreign currency forward contracts decreased by approximately $0.1 million, net of tax. At December 31, 2001, the Company had cumulative unrealized gains, net of tax, of $1.3 million on its foreign currency forward contracts. During 2002, the fair value of the Company's foreign currency forward contracts decreased by approximately $5.4 million, net of tax. At December 31, 2002, the Company had cumulative unrealized losses, net of tax, of $4.1 million on its foreign currency forward contracts.
Segment Information
        Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information", ("SFAS 131") establishes standards for reporting information on operating segments in interim and annual financial statements. The Company's chief operating
decision-makers review the profit and loss of the Company on an aggregate basis and manage the operations of the Company as a single operating segment. Accordingly, the Company operates in one segment, which is the business of developing, manufacturing and marketing drugs for human health care.
Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable
        SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 ("SAB 101") provides guidance on the recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenue in financial statements. SAB 101 establishes the SEC's view that it is not appropriate to recognize revenue until all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Further, SAB 101 requires that both title and the risks and rewards of ownership be transferred to the buyer before revenue can be recognized. The Company believes that its revenue recognition policies are in compliance with SAB 101.
        Revenues from product sales are recognized when product is shipped and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer. Revenues are recorded net of applicable allowances for returns, rebates and other applicable discounts and allowances. The Company prepares its estimates for sales returns and allowances, discounts and rebates quarterly based primarily on historical experience updated for changes in facts and circumstances, as appropriate.
        In February 2002, the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") released EITF Issue No. 01-09 ("EITF 01-09"), "Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor's Products)". EITF 01-09 states that cash consideration (including a sales incentive) given by a vendor to a customer is presumed to be a reduction of the selling prices of the vendor's products or services and, therefore, should be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized in the vendor's income statement, rather than a sales and marketing expense. The Company has various contracts with distributors that provide for discounts and rebates. These contracts are classified as a reduction of revenue. The Company also maintains select customer service contracts with distributors and other customers in the distribution channel. In accordance with EITF 01-09, the Company has established the fair value of these contracts and, as provided by EITF 01-09, classified these customer service contracts as sales and marketing expense. If the Company had concluded that sufficient evidence of the fair value did not exist for these contracts, the Company would have been required to classify these costs as a reduction of revenue. The adoption of EITF 01-09 did not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.
        The Company receives royalty revenues under license agreements with a number of third parties that sell products based on technology developed by the Company or to which the Company has rights. The license agreements provide for the payment of royalties to the Company based on sales of the licensed product. The Company records these revenues based on estimates of the sales that occurred during the relevant period. The relevant period estimates of sales are based on interim data provided by licensees and analysis of historical royalties paid to the Company (adjusted for any changes in facts and circumstances, as appropriate). The Company maintains regular communication with its licensees in order to gauge the reasonableness of its estimates. Differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are reconciled and adjusted for in the period which they become known, typically the following quarter. Historically, adjustments have not been material based on actual amounts paid by licensees. There are no future performance obligations on the part of the Company under these license agreements.
        Revenue is not recognized in any circumstances unless collectibility is reasonably assured.
        Biogen maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of Biogen's customers were to
deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required, which could affect future earnings.
Research and Development Expenses
        Research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits, facilities costs, overhead costs, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs, contract services and other outside costs. Research and development costs, including upfront fees and milestones paid to collaborators, are expensed as incurred. The Company has entered into certain research agreements in which it shares costs with its collaborator. The Company records these costs as research and development expenses. Certain of these costs are reimbursed by the Company's collaborator and are recorded as a reduction of research and development expense.
Earnings per Share
        The Company calculates earnings per share in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings per Share" ("SFAS 128"). SFAS 128 requires the presentation of "basic" earnings per share and "diluted" earnings per share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share the denominator includes both the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding and the number of dilutive common stock equivalents such as stock options and warrants, as determined using the treasury stock method.
        Shares used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share for the periods ending December 31, are as follows:
        Dilutive securities include options outstanding under the Company's stock option plans. Options to purchase 11.2 million shares, 3.8 million shares and 2.7 million shares were outstanding at December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively, but not included in the computations of diluted earnings per share because the options' exercise prices were greater than the average market price during the periods.
Accounting for Stock Based Compensation
        The Company has several stock-based compensation plans which are described more fully in Note 10. The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" in accounting for its plans and applies Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("SFAS 123") for disclosure purposes only. The SFAS 123 disclosures include pro forma net income and earnings per share as if the fair value-based method of accounting had been used. Stock issued to non-employees is accounted for in accordance with SFAS 123 and related interpretations.
        If compensation cost for the Company's 2002, 2001 and 2000 grants under the stock-based compensation plans, including costs related to prior years grants had been determined based on SFAS 123, the Company's pro forma net income, and pro forma earnings per share for the years ending December 31, would have been as follows:
        The fair value of options granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
        The effects of applying SFAS 123 in this pro forma disclosure are not indicative of future amounts. SFAS 123 did not apply to awards prior to 1995, and additional awards in future years are anticipated.
2.     Financial Instruments
        Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are accounts receivable and marketable securities. Wholesale distributors and large pharmaceutical companies account for the majority of the accounts receivable and collateral is generally not required. To mitigate the risk, the Company monitors the financial performance and credit worthiness of its customers. The Company invests its excess cash balances in marketable debt securities, primarily U.S. government securities and corporate bonds and notes, with strong credit ratings. The Company limits the amount of investment exposure as to institution, maturity and investment type.
        The average maturity of the Company's marketable securities as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 was 28 months and 29 months, respectively. Proceeds from maturities and other sales of marketable securities, which were primarily reinvested, for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were approximately $405 million, $735 million and $606 million, respectively. The cost of securities sold is determined based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and (losses) on these sales for
the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $2.7 million, $6.1 million and $(1.8) million, respectively.
        The following is a summary of marketable securities:
        The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the risk associated with its floating rate debt. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2002, representing the cash requirements of the Company to settle the agreements, approximated $5.1 million and was included in accrued expenses and other. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2001, representing the cash requirements of the Company to settle the agreements, was approximately $3.3 million and was included in accrued expenses and other. The Company has designated the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. There were no amounts of hedge ineffectiveness related to the Company's interest rate swaps during 2002 and 2001, and no gains or losses were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The Company records the differential to be paid or received on the interest rate swaps as incremental interest expense. The Company expects approximately $2.7 million in losses related to its interest rate swaps to affect earnings in 2003.
        The Company has foreign currency forward contracts to hedge specific forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. All foreign currency forward contracts have durations of ninety days to 12 months. These contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly, to the extent effective, any unrealized gains or losses on these foreign currency forward contracts are reported in other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses for the effective portion are recognized with the underlying hedge transaction. The Company assesses hedge ineffectiveness on a quarterly basis and records the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion to current earnings to the extent significant. If the Company determines that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, the Company discontinues hedge accounting for the affected portion of the hedge instrument and any related unrealized gain or loss on the contract is recognized in current earnings. The notional settlement amount of the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2002 was approximately $91.9 million. These contracts had a fair value of $6.4 million, representing an unrealized loss, and were included in other current liabilities at December 31, 2002. The notional settlement amount of the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2001 was approximately $113.4 million. These contracts had a fair value of $2.0 million, representing an unrealized gain, and were included in other current assets at December 31, 2001.
        In 2002, approximately $1.3 million of losses were recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. Additionally, in 2002, approximately $1.1 million of losses were recognized in earnings as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges upon determining that it was no longer probable
that the original forecasted transaction would occur. The Company recognized $6.4 million of losses in product revenue and $2.1 million of losses in royalty revenue for the settlement of certain effective cash flow hedge instruments during the year ended December 31, 2002. These settlements were recorded in the same period as the related forecasted transactions affecting earnings. The Company expects approximately $6.4 million of unrealized losses at December 31, 2002 to affect earnings in 2003 related to its foreign currency forward contracts.
        In 2001, there were no significant amounts recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness or as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges upon determining that it was no longer probable that the original forecasted transaction would occur. The Company recognized $6.9 million of gains in product revenue and $2 million of gains in royalty revenue for the settlement of certain effective cash flow hedge instruments during the year ended December 31, 2001. These settlements were recorded in the same period as the related forecasted transactions affecting earnings.
        In 2000, there were no significant amounts recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. During 2000, the Company recognized $977,000 in other income as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges upon determining that it was no longer probable that the original forecasted transaction would occur. The Company recognized $12.7 million of gains in product revenue and $3.7 million of gains in royalty revenue for the settlement of certain effective cash flow hedge instruments during the year ended December 31, 2000. These settlements were recorded in the same period as the related forecasted transactions affecting earnings.
3.     Borrowings
        As of December 31, 2002, the Company had $12.5 million outstanding under a floating rate loan with a bank (the "Term Loan"). The Term Loan is collateralized by the Company's laboratory and office building in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Term Loan provides for annual principal payments of $1.7 million in each of the years 1996 through 2004 with the balance due May 8, 2005. The Company also entered into an interest rate swap agreement, with the same bank, fixing its interest rate at 7.5% during the remaining term of the loan, payable semiannually.
        As of December 31, 2002, the Company had $29.8 million outstanding under a floating rate loan agreement with a bank for financing the construction of its biological manufacturing facility in North Carolina (the "Construction Loan"). The Construction Loan is collateralized by the facility. Payments of $805,000 are due quarterly through 2006 with the balance due in 2007. The Company also entered into an interest rate swap agreement, with the same bank, fixing its interest rate at 7.75% during the remaining term of the loan, payable quarterly.
        The Term Loan and Construction Loan agreements include various covenants, including financial covenants, which require the Company to maintain minimum net worth, cash flow and various financial ratios. The Company's long-term debt obligations are carried at face value, which approximates fair market value.
        Long-term debt at December 31, consists of the following:

        Accrued expenses and other:
5.     Pensions
        The Company has a defined benefit pension plan which provides benefits to all of its full-time U.S. employees. The Company also has a supplemental retirement benefit plan which covers certain employees. The pension plans are noncontributory with benefit formulas based on employee earnings and credited years of service. The Company's funding policy for its pension plans is to contribute amounts deductible for federal income tax purposes. Funds contributed to the plans are invested in fixed income and equity securities.
        The components of net periodic pension cost for each of the three years ended December 31 are summarized below:
        Reconciliations of projected benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets and the funded status of the plans as of December 31, are presented below:
        The Company's unfunded supplemental retirement plan, as of December 31, 2002 has the projected benefit and the accumulated benefit obligations of $8.4 million and $5.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2001 the projected benefit and the accumulated benefit obligations were $5.9 million and $4.6 million, respectively.
6.     Other Income (Expense), Net
        Total other income (expense), net consists of the following:
        Other income (expense) included the following (in thousands):
        As part of its quarterly assessments, the Company assessed the unrealized losses on its investments in Curis Inc. and Targeted Genetics Corporation (see "Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"), and determined that the positive evidence suggesting that these investments would recover to at least the Company's purchase price was not sufficient to overcome the presumption that the current market price of the investments was the best indicator of value at those dates. Accordingly, the related unrealized losses of approximately $10.1 million and $28 million were reclassified from other comprehensive income to current expense in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Sales of noncurrent marketable securities resulted in losses of $0.3 million in 2002, gains of $32.1 million in 2001, and gains of $101.1 million in 2000.
        In connection with the Company's assessment at December 31, 2002, $1.5 million of unrealized losses related to these marketable securities were determined to be temporary.
        In connection with the Company's loan policy described in Note 1, during the third quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a $10.5 million charge for the establishment of a reserve related to an outstanding loan to Targeted. Based on a review of the financial condition of the borrower at September 30, 2002, the Company determined that it was no longer probable that the loan would be repaid.
        In October 2002, the Company established The Biogen Foundation, a private, U.S. based, non-profit philanthropic organization. In December 2002, the Company made a charitable contribution of $15 million to fund The Biogen Foundation. The Foundation is to operate exclusively for the benefit of charitable, educational and scientific purposes. Certain executive officers and other employees of the Company serve as directors and officers of the Foundation. The Company classifies charitable contributions to other income (expense).
        During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company and Schering-Plough settled their dispute on the issue of whether and to what extent Schering-Plough has an obligation to pay royalties in the U.S. on sales of its alpha interferon products. The Company received a final settlement payment resulting in a net gain of $37.2 million, which was classified to other income (expense).
        In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a $55 million charge related to the final settlement of a patent infringement dispute with Berlex. The $55 million payment for settlement of litigation was charged to other income (expense) in the fourth quarter of 2002. In 2001, the Company reported an initial charge of $20 million as part of the settlement agreement. See Note 9.
        In 2000, the Company realized gains of approximately $24.1 million upon the acquisition by third parties of two companies in which the Company had invested.
7.     Income Taxes
        The components of income before income taxes and of income tax expense (benefit) for each of the three years ended December 31, are as follows:
        Deferred tax assets (liabilities) are comprised of the following at December 31:
        A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate for the periods ending December 31 is as follows:
        At December 31, 2002, the Company had tax credits of approximately $831,000, which can be carried forward indefinitely. During 2002, management concluded that the likelihood of the Company realizing state tax benefits relating to research, development and investment credits previously recognized as deferred tax assets is remote. Accordingly, the Company's deferred tax assets relating to tax credits were reduced by $24.6 million in 2002.
        As of December 31, 2002, undistributed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries included in consolidated retained earnings aggregated $339.4 million, exclusive of earnings that would result in little or no tax under current U.S. tax law. The Company intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the U.S. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable if such earnings were remitted to the U.S.
8.     Research Collaborations
        In January 2003, the Company signed a collaboration agreement (the "IDEC Agreement") with IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation ("IDEC"), under which Biogen and IDEC will collaborate on the development of three oncology therapeutics from Biogen's pipeline of early-stage product candidates: an anti-lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTBR) monoclonal antibody, an anti-CRIPTO monoclonal antibody, and an interferon beta (INF-b) gene delivery product. Under the terms of the IDEC agreement, IDEC initially will be responsible for the development costs of the product candidates, until that time, if any, when the Company exercises its opt-in rights (which must be done within a certain timeframe) with respect to each specific product candidate. If the Company exercises its opt-in rights for a specific product, IDEC and the Company will share all subsequent costs related to that specific product and the Company will retain fifty percent of any economic benefit related to the product. If the Company chooses not to exercise its opt-in rights, the Company would be entitled to receive royalty payments from future sales of the specific products.
        In December 2002, Biogen signed a collaboration agreement (the "Sunesis Agreement") with Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Sunesis") under which Biogen and Sunesis will collaborate on the discovery and development of oral therapeutics for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The parties will apply Sunesis' proprietary fragment-based drug discovery technology, known as "tethering," to generate small molecule leads that target select cytokines in the immune system. Under the terms of the Sunesis Agreement, the Company purchased 1.25 million shares of preferred stock of Sunesis for $6 million, the fair value of the shares. In addition, the Company paid a one-time nonrefundable license fee of $3 million which was charged to research and development expense and acquired certain exclusive licenses to develop and commercialize certain compounds resulting from the collaboration. The Company accounts for its investment in Sunesis, which is included in other assets, using the cost method of accounting, subject to periodic review of impairment. The Company will pay Sunesis a quarterly license maintenance fee of $357,500 during the period commencing on April 1, 2004 through July 1, 2005. Additionally, Biogen agreed to enter into a Credit Facility Agreement ("Loan Agreement") with Sunesis under which Biogen is obligated to loan Sunesis up to $4 million. No borrowings from the loan agreement were outstanding as of December 31, 2002. The Company has committed to paying Sunesis additional amounts upon the completion of certain future research milestones and first and second indication development milestones. If all the milestones were to be achieved, the Company would be required to pay up to an additional $60.5 million over the life of the agreement.
        In April 2002, the Company signed a development and marketing collaboration agreement (the "Celltech Agreement") with Celltech R&D Limited ("Celltech") under which the Company and Celltech agreed to collaborate on the development and commercialization of a humanized anti-TNF alpha antibody known as "CDP571" with potential value in treating gastrointestinal disorders (including Crohn's disease), psoriasis and other autoimmune disease conditions. Under the terms of the Celltech Agreement, Biogen and Celltech agreed to share costs for on-going development activities. In
April 2002, the Company paid a one-time non-refundable initiation fee of $500,000, which was charged to research and development expense. Biogen incurred development expenses for CDP571 during the second and third quarter of 2002, and in the third quarter of 2002, ceased participation in development expenses associated with CDP571 due to unfavorable Phase III data. Through December 31, 2002, the Company incurred approximately $7 million of research and development expenses associated with CDP571. The Company does not expect to pay any additional amounts in this collaboration.
        In July 2001, the Company signed a development and marketing collaboration agreement (the "ICOS Agreement") with ICOS Corporation ("ICOS"), under which the Company and ICOS are collaborating worldwide on the development and commercialization of orally active, small molecule LFA-1 antagonists. Biogen and ICOS are currently developing an oral small molecule LFA-1 antagonist as a potential treatment for psoriasis. Under the terms of the ICOS Agreement, the Company paid ICOS a one-time, non-refundable license fee of $8 million, which was charged to research and development expense in 2001. Additionally, as part of the agreement, Biogen made available to ICOS a line of credit in the amount of $20 million, of which $10 million was available at December 31, 2002. The Company provided $6.8 million and $2.3 million from the line of credit to ICOS that was recorded as a loan receivable and later was charged to research and development expense in 2002 and 2001, respectively, upon the achievement of certain clinical milestones by ICOS. As of December 31, 2002, there was $1.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the credit facility. The Company has committed to providing milestone payments to ICOS upon the achievement of certain future events. If all the future milestones were to be achieved and commercialization were to be successful in excess of specified levels of sales, the Company would be required to pay up to an additional $92.5 million over the remaining life of the agreement.
        In September 2000, the Company signed a collaborative research agreement (the "Eos Agreement") with Eos Biotechnology, Inc. ("Eos"), under which the Company and Eos will collaborate in the research and development of novel targets for antibody and protein therapeutics in the area of breast cancer. Under the Eos Agreement, the Company purchased 1.9 million shares of preferred stock of Eos for $5 million. In addition, the Company paid a one-time non-refundable license fee of $6 million, which was charged to research and development expense and acquired certain exclusive, worldwide rights related to breast cancer-specific molecules for the use in the development of new antibody and secreted protein therapeutics. The Company accounts for its investment in Eos, which is included in other assets, using the cost method of accounting subject to periodic review of impairment. The Company provided Eos with research and development funding of $1.5 million in 2002, $1.5 million in 2001 and $250,000 in 2000. The research program under the Eos Agreement was terminated in December 2002, thereby relieving Biogen of any future commitments. In February 2003, Eos and Protein Design Labs, Inc. ("PDLI") announced a definitive merger agreement under which PDLI would acquire 100% of the outstanding stock of Eos in a stock-for-stock transaction valued at $37.5 million. Upon completion of the merger, Biogen's preferred shares of EOS would be converted into common stock of PDLI. The Company expects to record a writedown of approximately $3 million in the first quarter of 2003 related to its investment in Eos.
        In August 2000, the Company signed a development and marketing collaboration agreement (the "Antegren Agreement") with Elan Pharma International, Ltd, an affiliate of Elan Corporation, plc ("Elan") under which the Company and Elan are collaborating in the development, manufacture and commercialization of ANTEGREN (natalizumab), a humanized monoclonal antibody. The Company and Elan are currently developing ANTEGREN as a potential treatment for MS and Crohn's disease. Under the terms of the Antegren Agreement, Biogen and Elan share costs for on-going development activities. The Company paid a one-time non-refundable license fee of $15 million in 2000, which was charged to research and development expense. The Company provided $7 million and $16 million to Elan for certain milestones achieved during the years 2002 and 2001, respectively, which were charged to research and development expense. As of December 31, 2002, Elan owed the Company
$14.8 million, representing development expenses incurred by Biogen to be reimbursed by Elan. The Company has committed to paying Elan additional amounts upon the completion of certain future milestones. If all the future milestones were to be achieved, the Company would be required to pay up to an additional $14 million over the remaining life of the agreement. Elan is in the process of implementing a recovery plan to re-build its business. The Company does not believe that business issues facing Elan will have a material adverse impact on the Company's rights to develop or commercialize ANTEGREN.
        In July 1996, the Company signed a collaborative research and commercialization agreement (the "Ontogeny Agreement") with Ontogeny, Inc. ("Ontogeny"), a private biotechnology company, for the development and commercialization of three specific proteins. In August 2000, Ontogeny merged with two other biotechnology companies to form Curis Inc. ("Curis"). As a shareholder in Ontogeny, Biogen received Curis common stock in exchange for the Company's shares in Ontogeny. The Company provided $1 million of research funding to Ontogeny in 2000. Additionally, the Company provided $1.5 million upon termination of the Ontogeny Agreement, which was charged to research and development expense in 2000. At December 31, 2002 the Company retained approximately 166,000 shares of Curis common stock, and included the investment in long-term marketable securities available-for-sale.
        In August 1995, the Company signed a collaborative research agreement (the "Genovo Agreement") for the development of human gene therapy treatments with Genovo, Inc. ("Genovo"), a gene therapy research company. Under the Genovo Agreement, the Company acquired 380,000 shares of Genovo Series A Preferred stock for $4.5 million and acquired certain licensing rights. The Company accounted for this investment, which was included in other assets, using the equity method of accounting. The Company recorded its proportion of Genovo's net losses as research and development expense in the amount of $3.9 million in 2000. In August 2000, Genovo entered into a merger agreement ("Targeted Merger Agreement") with Targeted Genetics Corporation ("Targeted"). As a shareholder in Genovo, Biogen received Targeted common stock in exchange for the Company's shares in Genovo. Also as part of the Targeted Merger Agreement, an existing $500,000 promissory note payable by Genovo to Biogen was converted into a no-interest promissory note from Targeted with a term of five years. Additionally, concurrently with the Targeted Merger Agreement, the Company entered into a development and marketing agreement and a funding agreement (the "Targeted Agreements") for gene therapy research and development. The Targeted Agreements provide for a $10 million credit facility, of which $10 million of borrowings were outstanding as of December 31, 2002. Targeted also had an option to sell to the Company an additional $10 million of Targeted common stock at fair value. In September 2002, Targeted exercised an option to issue $4 million of common stock to Biogen. During the third quarter of 2002, the Company incurred a $10.5 million charge for the establishment of a reserve related to an outstanding loan to Targeted. Based on a review of the financial condition of Targeted at September 30, 2002, the Company determined that it was no longer probable that the loan would be repaid. The Company provided $1 million in 2002, $1 million in 2001 and $250,000 in 2000 for research funding to Targeted. The Company expects to fund research activities of Targeted related to the collaboration of $750,000 in 2003. At December 31, 2002 the Company retained approximately 8,963,402 shares of Targeted common stock, and included the investment in long-term marketable securities available-for-sale.
9.     Commitments and Contingencies
        The Company rents laboratory and office space and certain equipment under noncancellable operating leases. The rental expense under these leases, which terminate at various dates through 2015, amounted to $22.7 million in 2002, $17.2 million in 2001, $14.9 million in 2000. The lease agreements contain various clauses for renewal at the option of the Company and, in certain cases, escalation clauses linked generally to rates of inflation.
        At December 31, 2002, minimum annual rental commitments under noncancellable leases were as follows:
        The Company's construction of a large scale manufacturing plant and a laboratory office building in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina was substantially completed in the first quarter of 2002. The Company continued its further expansion of its Research Triangle Park, North Carolina complex in 2002 with ongoing construction of several projects to create additional manufacturing capacity. These additional projects are expected to be completed by the summer of 2003 at a total cost of approximately $93.3 million. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had committed $81.7 million for construction costs related to these additional projects, of which $73.5 million has been spent. The Company is also completing plans to build a manufacturing plant in Denmark. The Company expects that construction will commence in 2003 and be completed early in 2005, at an estimated cost of $250 million. At December 31, 2002, $47 million had been committed for construction costs related to the manufacturing plant in Denmark, of which $36.8 million has been spent.
        In January 2002, the Company settled litigation with Berlex Laboratories, Inc. ("Berlex"). Berlex had claimed that the Company's production of AVONEX in the U.S. infringed certain U.S. patents which the Company refers to as the "McCormick" patents. A District Court decision in 2000 rendered final judgment in the Company's favor determining that the manufacture, use and sale of AVONEX in the U.S. did not infringe any of the claims of the asserted McCormick patents, but Berlex appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Under the settlement agreement, the Company agreed to pay Berlex $20 million, and to make a second and final payment to Berlex if the Court of Appeals were to reverse the District Court's previous ruling granting summary judgment in the Company's favor. As part of the settlement, both parties agreed not to pursue further litigation about these patents. Biogen recorded a $20 million charge in "Other Income, net" in the fourth quarter of 2001 to account for the first payment to Berlex. Because of the substantive terms of the Berlex settlement arrangement were agreed to in the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company determined that the provisions of SFAS 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," required that the Company account for this settlement in its December 31, 2001 financial statements. The guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"), Interpretation No. 14, "Reasonable Estimation of the Amount of a Loss, an Interpretation of SFAS 5", requires that when an amount within the range of potential loss appears to be a better estimate that any other amount within the range, that amount should be accrued. It further requires that when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount in the range should be accrued. In the case of the Berlex settlement, Biogen determined at the time of the settlement that $20 million was both the best estimate of the Company's potential loss, and the minimum amount in the range of potential losses. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $20 million related to the settlement in its December 31, 2001 financial statements.
        On January 31, 2003, the Court of Appeals decided that the District Court had properly construed the claims of the McCormick patents and that the Company did not literally infringe the McCormick patents. The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the District Court to determine if one of the
Berlex patents might be infringed under a redefinition of the "doctrine of equivalents" recently handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court. As a result of the decision, the Company was required to make a final payment to Berlex of $55 million under the settlement agreement which was recorded in December 2002. The previously negotiated contingent settlement eliminated the need for further litigation and resolved the entire dispute. The settlement agreement provides that Biogen receive a fully paid up, royalty free, non-exclusive license under the McCormick patent and a related patent held by Berlex. The Company negotiated a license in order to avoid future uncertainty surrounding the rights to the Berlex patent for Biogen and its distribution channel partners. The McCormick patents are not utilized by Biogen and, as such, do not hold value and will not provide future economic benefit to the Company. The $55 million payment for settlement of litigation was charged to other income (expense) in the fourth quarter of 2002.
        On October 13, 1998, the Company filed an opposition with the Opposition Division of the European Patent Office opposing the grant of a European patent (the "Rentschler II Patent") issued to Dr. Rentschler Biotechnologie GmbH ("Rentschler") claiming compositions of matter of beta interferon having specific glycosylation patterns. On November 6, 2002, a hearing took place with regard to the Company's opposition of the Rentschler II Patent in the European Patent Office. The Opposition Board of the European Patent Office ruled in an appealable decision that the present claims of the Rentschler II Patent should be maintained. Following this decision, Rentschler Biotechnologie GmbH & Co. KG sued our German subsidiary, Biogen GmbH, for infringement of the Rentschler II Patent in Germany. The Company intends to appeal the decision of the Opposition Division to the European Patent Office's Technical Board of Appeals. The Company believes that it has arguments to support the invalidation of the Rentschler II Patent before the Technical Board of Appeals. A decision on the appeal is not likely to be issued until at least two years after the Company files the appeal. Biogen also believes that it has solid arguments to support its defense against Rentschler's infringement claim in the German infringement lawsuit. A hearing in the German proceeding is scheduled to occur in September 2003, with a decision likely to follow within a month or two after the hearing. The non-prevailing party will then have the right to appeal the decision. A ruling on such an appeal would likely take another 12 to 18 months. The Company is closely examining the Opposition Board's recent written ruling and the claims made in the German infringement suit, and exploring various alternatives for handling these matters. If the Company were to be enjoined from selling AVONEX in Germany by the German district court pending our appeal of an adverse judgment, or, if the Company lost on appeal in the German infringement suit, or if, through other legal proceedings Rentschler were to obtain a determination that the Company's sales of AVONEX in other European countries infringes a valid Rentschler II patent, such a result or results could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. As a result, an estimate of any potential loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time.
        Along with most other major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, the Company has been named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by the County of Suffolk, New York, in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of New York in January 2003. In March 2003, the case was conditionally transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The complaint alleges that the defendants overstated the Average Wholesale Price ("AWP") for drugs for which Medicaid provides reimbursement ("Covered Drugs"), marketed and promoted the sale of Covered Drugs to providers based on the providers ability to collect inflated payments from the government and Medicaid beneficiaries that exceeded payments possible for competing drugs, provided financing incentives to providers to over-prescribe Covered Drugs or prescribe Covered Drugs in place of competing drugs, and overcharged Medicaid for illegally inflated Covered Drugs reimbursements. The complaint further alleges that the defendants failed to accurately report the "best price" on the Covered Drugs to New York's Medicaid program. Under Medicaid, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies agree to pay Medicaid programs a rebate for each product reimbursed by Medicaid. The amount of the rebate is often the difference between the average manufacturers price and the best price reported by companies
to the Medicaid program. Plaintiff claims that it was harmed because it could have allotted the dollars that it wrongfully spent on Medicaid to other public needs. Plaintiff has brought the action under the Racketeering Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), and for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, Medicaid fraud and common law fraud. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against all of the allegations and claims in this lawsuit. As a result, an estimate of any potential loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time.
10.   Shareholders' Equity
Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock
        The Company has authority to issue 20,000,000 shares of $.01 par value preferred stock.
Shareholder Rights Plan
        In 1989, the Company's Board of Directors declared a dividend to holders of the Company's common stock of rights (the "Old Rights") to purchase shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the "Old Preferred Stock"). Each Old Right entitled the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-hundredth of a share of Old Preferred Stock upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in a Rights Agreement, dated as of May 8, 1989, between the Company and The First National Bank of Boston (the "Old Plan"). The Old Plan and the Old Rights expired on May 8, 1999. Consequently, on April 16, 1999, the Board of Directors declared a dividend to holders of the Company's common stock of one new preferred share purchase right (a "New Right") for each outstanding share of common stock. The New Rights were granted on May 8, 1999 pursuant to a new Rights Agreement, dated May 8, 1999, between the Company and State Street Bank and Trust Company, as Rights Agent (the "New Plan"). Each New Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A-1 Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share ("New Preferred Stock"), at a price of $850 per one one-thousandth of a share of New Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment. Each one one-thousandth of a share of New Preferred Stock has rights, privileges and preferences which make its value approximately equal to the value of one share of the Company's common stock. The New Rights are exercisable only if a person or group acquires 20% or more of the outstanding common stock of the Company or commences a tender or exchange offer, the consummation of which would result in the ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding common stock of the Company. Once the New Rights become exercisable, and in some circumstances if additional conditions are met, each New Right will entitle the Company's shareholders (other than the acquirer) to, among other things, purchase common stock at a substantial discount. Unless earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company, the New Rights expire on May 8, 2009. The Company is entitled to redeem the New Rights at a price of $.001 per New Right.
        The Old Preferred Stock has been eliminated and replaced with the New Preferred Stock. At December 31, 2002, the Company had 250,000 shares of New Preferred Stock authorized for use in connection with the New Plan.
Share Option and Purchase Plans
        The Company has several stock-based compensation plans. The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" in accounting for its plans and applies Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("SFAS 123") for disclosure purposes only. The SFAS 123 disclosures include pro forma net income and earnings per share as if the fair value-based method of accounting had been used. Stock issued to non-employees is accounted for in accordance with SFAS 123 and related interpretations. Included in compensation expense for the periods ending December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were approximately $2.4 million,
$829,000, and $(249,000), respectively, related to stock based compensation plans for employees and non-employees.
        The Company has several plans and arrangements under which it may grant options to employees, Directors and Scientific Board members to purchase common stock. Under the terms of the Company's stock-based compensation plans, approximately 54 million options may be granted. Option grants are typically made under the 1985 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan and the 1987 Scientific Board Stock Option Plan (the "Plans"). Options under the Plans are granted at no less than 100% of the fair market value on the date of grant. Options generally become exercisable over various periods, typically 4 to 7 years for employees and 3 years for Directors and Scientific Board members, and have a maximum term of 10 years.
        Activity under these plans for the periods ending December 31, is as follows:
        The table below summarizes options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2002:
        The Company also has two employee stock purchase plans covering substantially all of its employees. The plans allow employees to purchase common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value at either the date of the beginning of the plan period or the purchase date. Purchases under the plans are subject to certain limitations and may not exceed an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares; no shares may be issued after December 31, 2007. Through December 31, 2002, 556,557 shares have been issued under the stock purchase plans.
Stock Repurchase Program
        On December 18, 2000, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 4 million shares of the Company's common stock. The repurchased stock provides the Company with treasury shares for general corporate purposes, such as stock to be issued under employee stock option and stock purchase plans. During 2002, the Company repurchased approximately 145,000 shares of its common stock at a cost of $8.4 million. During 2001, the Company repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $88.3 million. Approximately 2.4 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under this program at December 31, 2002. In the first quarter of 2003, the Company began open market repurchases for additional shares of its common stock under the program.
        On February 22, 1999, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 8 million shares of the Company's common stock. The repurchased stock provided the Company with treasury shares for general corporate purposes, such as stock to be issued under employee stock option and stock purchase plans. During 1999, the Company repurchased approximately 3.4 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $197.7 million. During 2000, the Company repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $300.2 million, completing this program.
11.   Segment Information
        The Company operates in one segment, which is the business of developing, manufacturing and marketing drugs for human health care. The chief operating decision-makers review the profit and loss of the Company on an aggregate basis and manage the operations of the Company as a single operating segment. The Company currently derives product revenues from sales of its AVONEX product for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. The Company also derives revenue from royalties on worldwide sales by the Company's licensees of a number of products covered under patents controlled by the Company, including alpha interferon and hepatitis B vaccines and diagnostic products. Revenues are primarily attributed from external customers to individual countries where earned based on location of the customer or licensee. At December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, product and royalty revenues from external customers in The Netherlands were approximately 11%, 11%, and 10% of total revenues, respectively.
        The Company's geographic information is as follows:
        The Company received revenue from three wholesale distributors and a specialty distributor in 2002 accounting for a total of 20%, 19%, 17%, and 16% of total product and royalty revenue. The Company received revenue from three wholesale distributors and a specialty distributor in 2001 accounting for a total of 21%, 16%, 14%, and 14% of total product and royalty revenue. The Company received revenue from five unrelated parties in 2000 accounting for a total of 18%, 13%, 12%, 11% and 10% of total product and royalty revenue.
12.   Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)
13.   New Accounting Pronouncements
        In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized at its fair market value when the liability is incurred, rather than at the date of an entity's commitment to an exit plan. The provisions of SFAS 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of SFAS 146 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.
        In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 ("FIN 45"), "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34." FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of certain guarantees. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are effective for financial statement periods ending after December 15, 2002.
        Under its charter, the Company has agreed to indemnify any person who is made a party to any action or threatened with any action as a result of such person's serving or having served as an officer or director of the Company or having served, at the Company's request, as an officer or director of another company. The indemnification does not apply if the person is adjudicated not to have acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that his or her actions were in the best interests of the Company. The indemnification obligation survives termination of the indemnified party's involvement with the Company but only as to those claims arising from such person's role as an officer or director. The Company has separate indemnification agreements with certain of its officers and directors that mirror the charter provisions. The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under the charter provision and the corresponding indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, the Company has Director and Officer insurance policies that, in most cases, would limit its exposure and enable it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of the insurance policy coverage, the estimated fair value of these indemnification provisions is minimal. All of these indemnification provisions were grandfathered under the provisions of FIN 45 as they were in effect prior to December 31, 2002. Accordingly, we have no liabilities recorded for these provisions as of December 31, 2002.
        The Company enters into indemnification provisions under its agreements with other companies in its ordinary course of business, typically with business partners, contractors, clinical sites and customers. Under these provisions the Company generally indemnifies and hold harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of the Company's activities. These indemnification provisions generally survive termination of the underlying agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited. The Company has not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. As a result, the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, the Company has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2002.
        In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and DisclosureAn Amendment of FAS No. 123." SFAS 148 amends SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" to provide alternative methods of transition for those companies who voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123
to require prominent disclosures in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The transition and annual disclosure provision of SFAS 148 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The Company has not adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation, and will continue to apply APB 25 for its stock-based compensation plans. The Company has incorporated the disclosure requirements of SFAS 148 at December 31, 2002, which require a tabular pro forma presentation of net income had SFAS 123 been adopted by the Company in the "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" footnote of the financial statements.
        In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51." FIN 46 requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved. Variable interest entities that effectively disperse risk will not be consolidated unless a single party holds an interest or combination of interests that effectively recombines risks that were previously dispersed. FIN 46 also requires enhanced disclosure requirements related to variable interest entities. FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. It applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003 to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. The adoption of FIN 46 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.

Exhibit 99.3
1.     BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
        Biogen, Inc. ("Biogen" or the "Company") is a global biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and markets novel human therapeutic products. Biogen's primary focus is developing pharmaceutical products that meet unmet medical needs particularly in its core therapeutic areas of neurology, dermatology and rheumatology. Biogen currently sells AVONEX (Interferon beta-1a) for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis ("MS") and AMEVIVE (alefacept) for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Biogen also receives revenues from royalties on sales by its licensees of a number of products covered under patents that Biogen controls and from contract revenues related to a collaborative agreement with IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation ("IDEC").
        In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring accruals, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Biogen and its subsidiaries. The Company's accounting policies are described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's 2002 Annual Report on Form 10-K and updated, as necessary, in this Form 10-Q. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year.
        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
        On June 20, 2003, Biogen entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with IDEC and Bridges Merger Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of IDEC. Under the merger agreement, if all of the applicable conditions are met, Biogen will merge with and into Bridges Merger Corporation and become a wholly owned subsidiary of IDEC and IDEC will change its name to Biogen Idec, Inc. If the merger is completed, Biogen stockholders will receive 1.15 shares of IDEC common stock for each share of Biogen common stock, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. The shares of the combined company are expected to be traded on the NASDAQ National Market under a new trading symbol. IDEC will account for the merger under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which means that the assets and liabilities of Biogen will be recorded, as of the completion of the merger, at their fair values and added to those of IDEC. The merger has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of both IDEC and Biogen. The transaction is subject to approval by the stockholders of both companies and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2003. The merger agreement provides for the payment of a termination fee of up to $230 million under certain termination scenarios. In connection with the proposed merger with IDEC, the Company has agreed to pay certain advisors up to $15 million upon completion of the merger, in addition to amounts previously paid, and a lesser amount should the merger terminate, contingent upon certain conditions.
INVENTORIES
        Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first-in/first-out ("FIFO") method. Included in inventory are raw materials used in the production of
pre-clinical and clinical products which are expensed as research and development costs when consumed. The components of inventories are as follows:
        Biogen writes down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual realizable value is less than that estimated by Biogen, additional inventory write-downs may be required. The Company wrote down $7.9 million and $17.4 million of unmarketable inventory for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003, respectively, which was charged to cost of product revenues. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, Biogen wrote off $2.9 million of inventory to research and development since it did not meet commercial specifications but will be utilized in research and development activities.
REVENUE RECOGNITION AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
        SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 ("SAB 101") provides guidance on the recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenue in financial statements. SAB 101 establishes the SEC's view that it is not appropriate to recognize revenue until all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Further, SAB 101 requires that both title and the risks and rewards of ownership be transferred to the buyer before revenue can be recognized. The Company believes that its revenue recognition policies are in compliance with SAB 101.
        Revenues from product sales are recognized when product is shipped and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer. When customers have inspection and approval rights for products, Biogen defers revenue until lapse of that right. Revenues are recorded net of applicable allowances for returns, rebates and other applicable discounts and allowances. The Company prepares its estimates for sales returns and allowances, discounts and rebates quarterly based primarily on historical experience updated for changes in facts and circumstances, as appropriate.
        In January 2003, Biogen received regulatory approval to market AMEVIVE in the U.S. In connection with the introduction of AMEVIVE, Biogen implemented a limited launch period initiative undertaken in cooperation with one of Biogen's distributors which provides a refund on purchases of AMEVIVE made after a private payor has initially verified that it will cover the product but later denies the claim after appeal and where the other requirements of the initiative are met. Under this initiative, Biogen's exposure is contractually limited to 10% of the price of all AMEVIVE purchased by the distributor. As a result, Biogen will defer recognition of revenue of 10% of AMEVIVE purchased by the distributor while this initiative was in effect until such time as sufficient history of insurance claims reimbursement becomes available. In connection with the launch initiative, the Company has recorded $1.3 million of deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other at September 30, 2003. This launch initiative is applicable to purchases of AMEVIVE made on or before July 31, 2003 and was replaced with a new initiative undertaken in cooperation with the same distributor. Under this new initiative, the distributor will provide a purchaser with a discount on future purchases of AMEVIVE if a payor has initially verified that it will cover the purchase of AMEVIVE by the purchaser but later denies the claim after appeal and where the other requirements of the initiative are met. Biogen will in turn provide the distributor with a discount on its future purchases of AMEVIVE equal to the amount
of the discount provided by the distributor under the initiative, up to a maximum discount of 5% on any purchase order submitted to Biogen by the distributor. This initiative is applicable to purchases of AMEVIVE made on or after August 1, 2003 through July 31, 2004. As a result, effective as of August 1, 2003, Biogen will defer recognition of revenue of 5% of AMEVIVE purchased by the distributor until such time as sufficient history of insurance claims reimbursement becomes available. In connection with this new initiative, the Company has recorded $0.4 million of deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other at September 30, 2003.
        In February 2002, the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") released EITF Issue No. 01-09 ("EITF 01-09"), "Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor's Products)". EITF 01-09 states that cash consideration (including a sales incentive) given by a vendor to a customer is presumed to be a reduction of the selling prices of the vendor's products or services and, therefore, should be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized in the vendor's income statement, rather than a sales and marketing expense. The Company has various contracts with distributors that provide for discounts and rebates. These contracts are classified as a reduction of revenue. The Company also maintains select customer service contracts with distributors and other customers in the distribution channel. In accordance with EITF 01-09, the Company has established the fair value of these contracts and, as provided by EITF 01-09, classified these customer service contracts as sales and marketing expense. If the Company should not be able to sustain the fair value of these contracts, the Company would be required to classify these costs as a reduction of revenue. The adoption of EITF 01-09 did not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.
        The Company receives royalty revenues under license agreements with a number of third parties that sell products based on technology developed by the Company or to which the Company has rights. There are no future performance obligations on the part of the Company under these license agreements. The license agreements provide for the payment of royalties to the Company based on sales of the licensed product. The Company records these revenues based on estimates of the sales that occurred during the relevant period. Differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are reconciled and adjusted for in the period which they become known, typically the following quarter. Historically, adjustments have not been material based on actual amounts paid by licensees.
        Revenue is not recognized in any circumstances unless collectibility is reasonably assured.
        Biogen maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of Biogen's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required, which could affect future earnings.
        In January 2003, the Company signed a collaboration agreement (the "IDEC Agreement") with IDEC, under which Biogen and IDEC are collaborating on the development of three oncology therapeutics from Biogen's pipeline of early-stage product candidates. Under the terms of the IDEC Agreement, IDEC initially will be responsible for the development costs of the product candidates, until that time, if any, when the Company exercises its opt-in rights (which must be done within a certain timeframe) with respect to each specific product candidate. Prior to exercising its opt-in rights, to the extent that the Company incurs any development costs in relation to the programs contained in the IDEC Agreement, they will be recorded as research and development expense. The reimbursement by IDEC of these costs will be recorded as contract revenue. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003, the Company recorded $3.1 million and $6.3 million, respectively, for contract revenue. Upon completion of the proposed merger, contract revenue related to this collaboration agreement will be eliminated.
ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
        The Company has several stock-based compensation plans. The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" in accounting for qualifying options granted to its employees under its plans and applies Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("SFAS 123") for disclosure purposes only. The SFAS 123 disclosures include pro forma net income and earnings per share as if the fair value method of accounting had been used. Stock issued to non-employees is accounted for in accordance with SFAS 123 and related interpretations.
        If compensation for employee options had been determined based on SFAS 123, the Company's pro forma net income, and pro forma earnings per share for the three and nine months ending September 30, would have been as follows:
        The fair value of options granted was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
        The effects of applying SFAS 123 in this pro forma disclosure are not indicative of future amounts. SFAS 123 did not apply to awards prior to 1995. Additional awards in future years are anticipated.
2.     FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
        Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", ("SFAS 133") requires that all derivatives be recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction. The Company assesses, both at its inception and
on an on-going basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of hedged items. The Company assesses hedge ineffectiveness on a quarterly basis and records the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion to current earnings to the extent significant. If the Company determines that a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, the Company discontinues hedge accounting for the affected portion of the hedge instrument, and any unrealized gain or loss on the contract is recognized in current earnings within other income (expense).
        As of September 30, 2003, the Company had $11.7 million outstanding under a floating rate loan collateralized by one of the Company's laboratory and office buildings in Cambridge, Massachusetts and $27.4 million outstanding under a floating rate loan agreement for financing the construction of its biological manufacturing facility in North Carolina. The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the risk associated with its floating rate debt. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements, representing the cash requirements of the Company to settle the agreements, was approximately $4.4 million and $5.1 million at September 30, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively, and was included in accrued expenses and other. The Company has designated the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. There were no amounts of hedge ineffectiveness related to the Company's interest rate swaps during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003 or in the comparable periods of 2002, and no gains or losses were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The Company records the differential to be paid or received on the interest rate swaps as incremental interest expense.
        The Company has foreign currency forward contracts to hedge specific forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. All foreign currency forward contracts have durations of ninety days to nine months. These contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly, to the extent effective, any unrealized gains or losses on these foreign currency forward contracts are reported in other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses for the effective portion are recognized with the underlying hedge transaction. The notional settlement amount of the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2003 was approximately $47.5 million. These contracts had a fair value of approximately $5.3 million, representing an unrealized loss, and were included in accrued expenses and other at September 30, 2003.
        For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003, there were no significant amounts recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. For the three months ended September 30, 2002, there were no significant amounts recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. For the nine months ended September 30, 2002, approximately $0.6 million was recognized as expense due to hedge ineffectiveness. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, there were no significant amounts recognized as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedge accounting because it was no longer probable that the hedge forecasted transaction would occur. The Company recognized approximately $2.7 million and $7.8 million of losses in product revenue for the settlement of certain effective cash flow hedge instruments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003, respectively. The Company recognized approximately $1.4 million and $4.0 million of losses in royalty revenue for the settlement of certain effective cash flow hedge instruments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003, respectively. The Company recognized approximately $2.3 million and $2.7 million of losses in product revenue for the settlement of certain effective cash flow hedge instruments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2002, respectively. The Company recognized approximately $0.6 million and $0.9 million of losses in royalty revenue for the settlement of certain effective cash flow hedge instruments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2002, respectively. These settlements were recorded in the same period as the related forecasted transactions affected earnings.
3.     COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
        Comprehensive income comprises net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income includes certain changes in equity that are excluded from net income, such as translation adjustments and unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale marketable securities, net of tax and derivative instruments, net of tax. Comprehensive income for the three months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002 was $60.9 million and $54.3 million, respectively. Comprehensive income for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002 was $194.8 million and $163 million, respectively.
4.     EARNINGS PER SHARE
        The Company calculates earnings per share in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings per Share" ("SFAS 128"). SFAS 128 requires the presentation of "basic" earnings per share and "diluted" earnings per share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, the denominator includes both the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding and the number of dilutive common stock equivalents such as stock options and warrants, as determined using the treasury stock method.
        Shares used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and nine month periods ending September 30, are as follows:
        Options to purchase approximately 13.2 million and 10.7 million shares were outstanding at September 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively, but not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options' exercise prices were greater than the average market price during the period.
5.     SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
        On December 18, 2000, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 4 million shares of the Company's common stock. The repurchased stock provides the Company with treasury shares for general corporate purposes, such as stock to be issued under employee stock option and stock purchase plans. During the first nine months of 2003, the Company repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of its common stock under this program at a cost of $45.8 million. The Company purchased 145,000 shares during the first nine months of 2002 at a cost of $8.4 million. During 2001, the Company repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $88.3 million. Approximately 1.2 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under this program at September 30, 2003.
6.     OTHER INCOME, NET
        Other income, net consists of the following (in thousands):
        Other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2003 consists primarily of $0.7 million of realized gains from the sale of noncurrent marketable securities, a charge of $1.8 million related to the impairment of certain noncurrent investments, and $0.5 million of foreign exchange remeasurement losses. Other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2002 consisted primarily of $0.9 million of losses attributable to a fund in which Biogen had invested, a charge of $7.9 million related to the writedown of certain investments, and a $10.5 million charge for the establishment of a reserve related to an outstanding loan to a collaborator.
        Other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 consists primarily of a $12.9 million charge related to the settlement of a patent infringement dispute, a $3.1 million writedown of Biogen's investment in Eos Biotechnology Inc. ("Eos") due to Protein Design Lab, Inc's acquisition of Eos in the first quarter of 2003, $1.7 million of foreign exchange remeasurement gains, $2.2 million of realized
gains from the sale of noncurrent marketable securities, $1.8 million related to the impairment of certain noncurrent investments, and $1.5 million of gains on sales of current marketable securities. Other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 consisted primarily of $3.7 million of losses attributable to a fund in which Biogen had invested, a charge of $10.1 million related to the writedown of certain investments, and a $10.5 million charge for the establishment of a reserve related to an outstanding loan to a collaborator.
7.     INCOME TAX EXPENSE
        Income tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax income was 28% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002. The effective tax rate varied from the U.S. statutory rates for the first nine months of 2003 and 2002 primarily due to higher sales in European jurisdictions with lower tax rates and to the utilization of research and development credits.
8.     LITIGATION
        On October 13, 1998, the Company filed an opposition with the Opposition Division of the European Patent Office opposing the grant of a European patent (the "Rentschler II Patent") issued to Dr. Rentschler Biotechnologie GmbH ("Rentschler") claiming compositions of matter of beta interferon having specific glycosylation patterns. On November 6, 2002, a hearing took place with regard to the Company's opposition of the Rentschler II Patent in the European Patent Office. The Opposition Board of the European Patent Office ruled that the present claims of the Rentschler II Patent should be maintained. Following this decision, Rentschler Biotechnologie GmbH & Co. KG sued the Company's German subsidiary, Biogen GmbH, for infringement of the Rentschler II Patent in Germany. In April 2003, the Company and Rentschler settled their litigation which brought to a close all pending legal proceedings in the German district court and the European Patent Office. Under the Settlement and License Agreement, the Company agreed to pay Rentschler $12.9 million as a one-time payment in settlement of litigation and has agreed to an ongoing royalty on sales of AVONEX in the relevant European countries in which the Rentschler II patent is in effect. As part of the settlement, both parties agreed not to pursue further litigation on these patents, including any appeal of the decision in the European Patent Office.
        Because the substantive terms of the Rentschler settlement arrangement were agreed to in the first quarter of 2003, the Company determined that the provisions of SFAS 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," required that the Company account for this settlement in the first quarter of 2003. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $12.9 million related to the settlement in other income (expense), net in its March 31, 2003 financial statements.
        Along with most other major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, the Company has been named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by each of the County of Suffolk, New York, the County of Westchester, New York, and the County of Rockland, New York. The Suffolk County case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The Westchester County case and the Rockland County case were brought in the third quarter of 2003 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York; it is anticipated that these cases will be transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The complaints allege that the defendants overstated the Average Wholesale Price ("AWP") for drugs for which Medicaid provides reimbursement ("Covered Drugs"), marketed and promoted the sale of Covered Drugs to providers based on the providers ability to collect inflated payments from the government and Medicaid beneficiaries that exceeded payments possible for competing drugs, provided financing incentives to providers to over-prescribe Covered Drugs or to prescribe Covered Drugs in place of competing drugs, and overcharged Medicaid for illegally inflated Covered Drugs reimbursements. The complaint further alleges that the defendants failed to accurately report the "best price" on the Covered Drugs to New York's Medicaid program. Under Medicaid, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies agree to pay Medicaid programs a
rebate for each product reimbursed by Medicaid. The amount of the rebate is often the difference between the average manufacturers price and the best price reported by companies to the Medicaid program. Plaintiffs claim that they were harmed because they could have allotted the dollars that they wrongfully spent on Medicaid to other public needs. Plaintiffs have brought the action under the Racketeering Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), and for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, unfair trade practices, Medicaid fraud, common law fraud, and violation of each of the federal Medicaid Statute, the New York Social Services Law and the New York Department of Health Regulations. In September 2003, the Company joined other named defendants in filing with the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts a Motion to Dismiss the Amended Suffolk County Complaint. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against all of the allegations and claims in these lawsuits. As a result, an estimate of any potential loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time.
        On June 25, 2003, a suit was filed in the Superior Court of California, County of San Diego, on behalf of a purported class of Biogen stockholders against Biogen, IDEC and certain members of Biogen's board of directors alleging, among other things, that the members of Biogen's board of directors breached their fiduciary duties of candor, loyalty, due care, independence, good faith and fair dealing by tailoring the structural terms of the merger to meet the specific needs of IDEC rather than attempting to obtain the highest price reasonably available for Biogen. An agreement in principal to resolve the suit has been reached based upon the disclosure of certain additional information in the joint proxy statement/prospectus in the registration statement on Form S-4 filed by IDEC in connection with the proposed merger between the Company and IDEC and the payment of attorneys' fees in an amount to be determined by the court. The settlement and related attorney fees are not expected to be material.
        On July 15, 2003, Biogen filed suit against Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York ("Columbia") in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, contending that Biogen no longer has any obligation to pay royalties to Columbia on sales of AVONEX in the U.S. under a 1993 License Agreement between Biogen and Columbia related to U.S. Patent Nos. 4,399,216; 4,634,665; and 5,179,017 (the "Original Patents") or under a newly issued patent, U.S. Patent No. 6,455,275 (the "275 Patent"). In its suit, Biogen is seeking a declaratory judgment that it has no obligation to pay any further royalties under the license agreement because the Original Patents have expired and the "275 Patent is invalid and unenforceable; and that Columbia should be permanently enjoined from demanding any further royalties based on the "275 Patent or on any pending continuations, continuations-in-part, or divisional applications of the Original Patents. Columbia has taken the position that Biogen still owes it royalties under the license agreement on the basis of the "275 Patent which was issued on September 24, 2002, over two years after the expiration of the Original Patents. Genzyme Corporation and Abbott Bioresearch Center, Inc. have joined Biogen in its suit against Columbia. In the event that Biogen is unsuccessful in the present litigation, Biogen may be liable for damages suffered by Columbia with respect to withheld royalties and such other relief as Columbia may seek and be granted by the Court. In the second quarter 2003, as a result of the Company's assessment of the invalidity of the "275 Patent, the Company determined that it was probable that no additional amounts would be paid to Columbia. As a result, the Company eliminated a related accrual of $8 million in cost of product revenues and no longer provides for any royalties related to the "275 Patent.
9.     SEGMENT INFORMATION
        The Company operates in one segment, which is the business of developing, manufacturing and marketing drugs for human health care. The chief operating decision-makers review the profit and loss of the Company on an aggregate basis and manage the operations of the Company as a single operating segment. The Company currently derives product revenues primarily from sales of its
AVONEX product for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS, and to a lesser extent, from sales of its AMEVIVE product, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in January 2003 for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. The Company also derives revenue from royalties on sales by the Company's licensees of a number of products covered under patents controlled by the Company and from contract revenues related to a collaborative agreement with IDEC.
10.   GUARANTEES
        Under its charter, the Company has agreed to indemnify any person who is made a party to any action or threatened with any action as a result of such person's serving or having served as an officer or director of the Company or having served, at the Company's request, as an officer or director of another company. The indemnification does not apply if the person is adjudicated not to have acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that his or her actions were in the best interests of the Company. The indemnification obligation survives termination of the indemnified party's involvement with the Company but only as to those claims arising from such person's role as an officer or director. The Company has separate indemnification agreements with certain of its officers and directors that do not provide any greater coverage than that found in the charter provisions. The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under the charter provision and the corresponding indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, the Company has Director and Officer insurance policies that, in most cases, would limit its exposure and enable it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The estimated fair value of these indemnification provisions is minimal. Accordingly, we have no liabilities recorded for these provisions as of September 30, 2003.
        The Company enters into indemnification provisions under its agreements with other companies in its ordinary course of business, typically with business partners, financial advisors, contractors, clinical sites and customers. Under these provisions the Company generally indemnifies and hold harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of the Company's activities. These indemnification provisions generally survive termination of the underlying agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited. The Company has not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. As a result, the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, the Company has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of September 30, 2003.
11.   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
        In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51." FIN 46 requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved. Variable interest entities that effectively disperse risk will not be consolidated unless a single party holds an interest or combination of interests that effectively recombines risks that were previously dispersed. FIN 46 also requires enhanced disclosure requirements related to variable interest entities. FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. It applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after December 15, 2003 to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. The adoption of FIN 46 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.
        In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts
(collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities under FASB Statement No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities". The adoption of SFAS 149 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.
        In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity." SFAS 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). Many of those instruments were previously classified as equity. This Statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 150 did not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.

Item 4. Changes In Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
     On November 17, 2003, upon the recommendation of its audit committee, the board of directors of the Registrant, approved the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PricewaterhouseCoopers") as the independent accountant of the Registrant and dismissed KPMG LLP ("KPMG") from the position of independent accountant of the Registrant. PricewaterhouseCoopers was the independent accountant of Biogen, Inc. ("Biogen"), which became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant on November 12, 2003, when Bridges Merger Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant, was merged with and into Biogen.
     The reports of KPMG on the Registrant's financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor were such reports qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the Registrant's fiscal years ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2002 and through the subsequent interim period to September 30, 2003, the Registrant did not have any disagreement with KPMG on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure that, if not resolved to KPMG's satisfaction, would have caused KPMG to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its report. During that time, there were no "reportable events" as set forth in Item 304(a)(1)(v)(A)-(D) of Regulation S-K adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
     During the Registrant's last two fiscal years and through the interim period to November 12, 2003, the Registrant has not consulted PricewaterhouseCoopers regarding any of the matters specified in Item 304(a)(2) of Regulation S-K.
     The Registrant has provided KPMG with a copy of this Form 8-K prior to its filing with the Commission. KPMG has provided a letter to the Registrant, dated November 21, 2003 and addressed to the Commission, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 16.1 and is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

The Registrant and Biogen Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements
     The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements give effect to the merger of the Registrant and Biogen in a transaction to be accounted for as a purchase with the Registrant treated as the acquirer. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet combines the historical consolidated balance sheets of the Registrant and Biogen as of September 30, 2003, giving effect to the merger as if it occurred on September 30, 2003. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income combine the historical consolidated statements of income of the Registrant and Biogen for the year ended December 31, 2002 and the nine months ended September 30, 2003, giving effect to the merger as if it occurred on January 1, 2002, reflecting only pro forma adjustments expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results.
     These unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are for informational purposes only. They do not purport to indicate the results that would have actually been obtained had the merger been completed on the assumed date or for the periods presented, or which may be realized in the future. To produce the pro forma financial information, the Registrant allocated the purchase price using its best estimates of fair value. These estimates are based on the most recently available information. To the extent there are significant changes to Biogen's business, including results from ongoing clinical trials, the assumptions and estimates herein could change significantly. Furthermore, the parties expect to have reorganization and restructuring expenses as well as potential operating efficiencies as a result of combining the companies. The pro forma financial information does not reflect these potential expenses and efficiencies. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the historical consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, of the Registrant and Biogen covering these periods.
 
 
 
 
1. Description of Transaction and Basis of Presentation
     On November 12, 2003, the Registrant and Biogen completed a merger of equals transaction in which a wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant was merged with and into Biogen in a transaction accounted for as a purchase under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Under the purchase method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of Biogen were recorded as of the acquisition date, at their fair values and added to those of the Registrant. The reported financial condition and results of operations of the Registrant will reflect these values, but will not be restated retroactively to reflect historical financial position or results of operations at Biogen. The transaction qualified as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the terms of the merger agreement, each share of Biogen common stock outstanding at the closing of the merger was exchanged for 1.15 shares of the Registrant common stock, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. In addition, each option to purchase Biogen common stock outstanding at the closing of the merger was assumed by the Registrant and thereafter constituted an option to acquire the number of shares of the Registrant common stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of Biogen common stock subject to the option immediately prior to the merger by 1.15, rounded down to the nearest whole share, with an exercise price equal to the exercise price of the assumed Biogen option divided by 1.15, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Each of these options is subject to the same terms and conditions that were in effect for the related Biogen options.
2. Purchase Price
     A preliminary estimate of the purchase price is as follows (table in thousands):
The fair value of the Registrant shares used in determining the purchase price was $37.69 per share based on the average of the closing price of the Registrant common stock for the period two days before through two days after the announcement of the merger on June 23, 2003. The fair value of the Registrant stock options issued was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: stock price of $37.69, which is the value ascribed to the Registrant shares in determining the purchase price; volatility of 40%; risk-free interest rate of 1.8%; and an expected life of 4.0 years.
 
The estimated purchase price has been allocated to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of September 30, 2003 (table in thousands):
The allocation of the purchase price is preliminary. The final determination of the purchase price allocation will be based on the fair values of assets acquired, including the fair values of in-process research and development, other identifiable intangibles and deferred stock-based compensation and the fair values of liabilities assumed as of November 12, 2003, the date that the merger was consummated. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired is allocated to goodwill. The purchase price allocation will remain preliminary until the Registrant completes a third-party valuation of significant identifiable intangible assets acquired (including in-process research and development) and determines the fair values of other assets and liabilities acquired. The final determination of the purchase price allocation will be completed as soon as practicable. The final amounts allocated to assets and liabilities acquired could differ significantly from the amounts presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements.
     The amount allocated to acquired identifiable intangible assets has been attributed to the following categories (table in thousands):
     The estimated fair value attributed to core technology, which relates to Biogen's existing FDA-approved products, was determined based on a discounted forecast of the estimated net future cash flows to be generated from the technology. The estimated fair value attributed to core technology will be amortized over 15 to 21 years which is the estimated period over which cash flows will be generated from the technology.
     The estimated fair value attributed to patents represents only those patents from which Biogen derives cash flows through contractual third-party out-licensing activity and not patents related to Biogen's current product portfolio or in-process research projects. The estimated fair value was determined based on a discounted forecast of the estimated net future cash flows to be generated from the patents. The estimated fair value attributed to patents will be amortized over 12 years which is the estimated period over which cash flows will be generated from the patents.
 
     The amount allocated to in-process research and development represents an estimate of the fair value of purchased in-process technology for research projects that, as of the expected closing date of the merger, will not have reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use. Only those research projects that had advanced to a stage of development where management believed reasonable net future cash flow forecasts could be prepared and a reasonable likelihood of technical success existed were included in the estimated fair value. Accordingly, the in-process research and development primarily represents the estimated fair value of ANTEGREN, Biogen's drug currently in Phase III development for Crohn's disease and multiple sclerosis. The estimated fair value of the in-process research and development was determined based on a discounted forecast of the estimated net future cash flows for each project, adjusted for the estimated probability of technical success and FDA approval for each research project. In-process research and development will be expensed immediately following consummation of the merger.

Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     The attached press release includes information with respect to the Registrant's "pro forma" full quarter and full year revenues, as if the Registrant and the former Biogen, Inc. had been combined for the duration of each of period. These are non-GAAP financial measures. Management utilizes these non-GAAP financial measures to monitor and evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and to gain an understanding of the comparative operating performance of the Registrant. Management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors regarding the Registrant's financial condition and results of operations because they include information that is relevant to an understanding of the Registrant's business or the prospects for the Registrant's future performance.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Cambridge, MA (February 11, 2004)  Biogen Idec (NASDAQ: BIIB) today reported unaudited pro forma revenues for the fourth quarter and full year 2003 (see attached tables for reconciliation of unaudited GAAP revenues to unaudited pro forma combined revenues). Led primarily by strong worldwide performances from AVONEX (Interferon beta-1a) and RITUXAN (rituximab), Biogen Idec's unaudited pro forma total revenues for 2003 rose 19 percent to $1.852 billion versus a comparable basis in 2002 of $1.553 billion. Unaudited pro forma combined revenues in the fourth quarter increased 15 percent to $491 million versus a comparable basis in 2002 of $426 million.
As a result of the merger, Biogen Idec will report GAAP results for the fourth quarter and full year 2003 that include the consolidated results of a full year of the former IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation and the 7 weeks of post-merger activity of the former Biogen, Inc. Unaudited GAAP revenues for the full year 2003 will exceed $679 million. In order to provide reasonably comparable trend perspectives, pro forma information includes full quarter and full year revenues, as if the two companies had been combined for the duration of each period. The GAAP financial results will be provided for the fourth quarter and full year 2003 on March 2, 2004.
James Mullen, Biogen Idec's Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are pleased to enter 2004 with excellent revenue momentum."

BIOGEN IDEC AND ELAN ANNOUNCE INTENTION TO SUBMIT ANTEGREN FOR APPROVAL FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS BASED ON ONE-YEAR DATA
Biogen Idec and Elan Corporation, plc today announced that they expect to submit to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) an application for approval of ANTEGREN (natalizumab) as a treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS). The companies expect to submit the filing mid-year 2004.
Cambridge, MA, San Diego, CA and Dublin, Ireland (February 18, 2004) 
The decision to file a Biologics License Application (BLA) was made after discussions with the FDA of one-year data from the two ongoing two-year Phase III trials in MS. The companies are committed to completing the two-year trials. To protect the integrity of the trials, the companies are not disclosing the one-year data at this time.
Biogen Idec and Elan are collaborating equally on the development of natalizumab for MS, Crohn's disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.
About the ANTEGREN MS Clinical Trials
The AFFIRM (natalizumab safety and efficacy in relapsing-remitting MS) trial is a two-year, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of approximately 900 patients, evaluating the ability of natalizumab to slow the progression of disability in MS and reduce the rate of clinical relapses. The SENTINEL (safety and efficacy of natalizumab in combination with AVONEX (Interferon beta-1a)) trial is a two-year, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of approximately 1,200 patients with relapsing-remitting MS, evaluating the effect of the combination of natalizumab and AVONEX compared to treatment with AVONEX alone in slowing the progression of disability and reducing the rate of clinical
 
relapses. Both studies have protocols that included a one-year analysis of the data. The primary endpoints for both Phase III two-year trials in MS are based on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and relapse rates. The pre-specified primary endpoint of the one-year analysis was relapse rates.
About ANTEGREN (natalizumab)
Natalizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, is the first alpha-4 antagonist in the new SAM (selective adhesion molecule) inhibitor class. The drug was designed to selectively inhibit immune cells from leaving the bloodstream and to prevent these cells from migrating into chronically inflamed tissue as occurs in a variety of inflammatory diseases. To date, approximately 2,800 patients have received natalizumab in clinical studies. In previous clinical trials, the following adverse events occurred more commonly with natalizumab when compared to placebo: headache, nausea, abdominal pain, infection, urinary tract infection, pharyngitis and rash. Serious adverse events have included infrequent hypersensitivity-like reactions.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Cambridge, MA (March 2, 2004)  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB), a global biotechnology leader with top products and capabilities in oncology and immunology, announced today that adjusted pro forma earnings per share were $0.24 for the fourth quarter of 2003 and $1.22 for the full year 2003.
Adjusted pro forma earnings per share and net income for the fourth quarter and full year 2003 include revenues and expenses from the former Biogen, Inc from January 1 to November 12, 2003 but exclude: (1) certain merger-related accounting impacts such as write off of acquired in-process research and development, amortization of intangibles, and inventory step up, (2) certain merger-related charges, and (3) all other non-operating charges of former Biogen, Inc and IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation during those periods. These adjustments, expenses, and non-operating charges are itemized on the attached reconciliation tables.
On a reported basis, calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Biogen Idec reported a loss of $991 million (or loss per share of $4.03) in the fourth quarter of
 
2003 and a loss of $875 million (or loss per share of $4.92). The fourth quarter and full year losses were primarily due to the $823 million write-off of acquired in-process research and development related to the merger. GAAP results include the results of operations of former Biogen, Inc. from November 13, 2003 through December 31, 2003.
"Since the completion of our merger late last year, we've had a string of successes in our product pipeline," said James Mullen, Biogen Idec's Chief Executive Officer. "Furthermore, the past four months of operating as one organization have confirmed the promise of our new company. Biogen Idec is well positioned to achieve our long-term goal of delivering an average of 15 percent top line and 20 percent bottom line growth through 2007."
Biogen Idec's pro forma combined revenues for 2003 rose 19 percent to $1.852 billion versus a comparable basis in 2002 of $1.553 billion. Pro forma combined revenues in the fourth quarter of 2003 increased 15 percent to $491 million versus a comparable basis in 2002 of $426 million.
Product Sales Performance
Revenues from AVONEX (Interferon beta-1a), Biogen Idec's therapy for patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), for the fourth quarter increased 21 percent to $310 million (pro forma combined) from the fourth quarter of 2002. Full year AVONEX sales were $1.168 billion (pro forma combined), an increase of 13 percent over the prior year sales. In 2003, U.S. sales of AVONEX were $800 million and international sales for AVONEX were $368 million (pro-forma combined).
AMEVIVE (alefacept), Biogen Idec's treatment for moderate to severe psoriasis, was approved at the end of January 2003. AMEVIVE sales were $17 million (pro forma combined) in the fourth quarter and $40 million (pro forma combined) for the full year.
Sales of ZEVALIN (ibritumomab tiuxetan), Biogen Idec's radioimmunotherapeutic agent, were $4.5 million in the fourth quarter as compared to $5.5 million for the same period last year. For the full year 2003, ZEVALIN sales were $20 million as compared to $14 million for 2002.
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2003 included $130 million from our joint business arrangement with Genentech, Inc. related to RITUXAN (rituximab), a treatment for certain B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas that Biogen Idec co-promotes in the U.S. with Genentech, compared to $117 million for the fourth quarter of 2002. Revenues for the full year 2003 included $493 million from our joint business arrangement with Genentech related to RITUXAN compared to $386 million for 2002. All U.S. sales of RITUXAN are recognized by Genentech and we record our share of the pretax copromotion profits on a quarterly basis. U.S. net sales of RITUXAN in the fourth quarter and full year of 2003, as recorded by Genentech, were $369 million and $1.360 billion, respectively, compared to $318 million and $1.080 billion for the comparable periods in 2002.
 
Financial Guidance
Biogen Idec today reaffirmed its long-term goal of achieving 15 percent compound annual revenue growth, and approximately 20 percent compound annual earnings per share (adjusted pro forma) growth through 2007. The recent announcement by the Company, along with its partner, Elan Corporation plc (Elan), of their intention to submit with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration an application for the approval of ANTEGREN (natalizumab) as a treatment for MS based on 1-year Phase III results further enhances the Company's confidence in its ability to achieve these previously stated earnings and revenue goals.
In 2004, the Company anticipates its effective tax rate for 2004 to be in the range of 31  33% and capital expenditures to peak in the range of $325 million to $400 million. A significant portion of these expenditures will be directed towards the construction of a large-scale manufacturing facility and administrative, research and development space in the San Diego area. Additionally, the Company expects to generate an average of $500 million in annual operating cash flow over the next four years.
Biogen Idec Announces Stock Repurchase Plan
Biogen Idec announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 12 million shares of its common stock. The repurchased stock will provide the Company with treasury shares for general corporate purposes, such as stock to be issued under employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Stock purchases will occur from time to time over the next two years, depending on market conditions and other corporate considerations. The share buyback will be largely funded through operating cash flow and will be accretive to EPS.
William Rastetter, Biogen Idec's Executive Chairman, said, "This share repurchase plan underscores the belief of management and the Board of Directors that our common stock represents an attractive investment for the Company, based on our well-defined strategy and our prospects for future growth. Given our strong anticipated operating cash flow, this program will not restrict our strategic flexibility."
The Company currently has approximately 331 million shares of common stock outstanding.

Safe Harbor
This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding expected future financial results and plans for our development programs.
These statements are based on the Company's current beliefs and expectations. A number of risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially. For example, financial results, including future revenues, revenue growth, earnings per share, product sales, royalties, expenses, effective tax rate, and capital expenditures, may be affected by a number of factors, including any slowing of growth of the markets for AVONEX and RITUXAN, any change in market acceptance of these products in key markets worldwide, the extent to which the Company achieves market acceptance of its other products, the impact of reimbursement and pricing decisions related to the Company's products, the impact of competitive products on the Company's products, any material decreases in sales by licensees of products on which the Company receives royalties, the impact of litigation, any unanticipated increase in expenses, in-licensing and product opportunities, and any material issues, delays or failures related to the manufacturing or supply of the Company's products. For example, we have encountered certain problems in the manufacture of AVONEX. As a result, we have had to write down a number of batches. If these problems continue, we would likely have to incur additional charges and could potentially experience an interruption in the supply of AVONEX.
Our long-term growth will depend on the successful development and commercialization of new products such as ANTEGREN. Drug development involves a high degree of risk. For example, our plans to file a BLA for approval of ANTEGREN as a treatment for MS could be negatively affected if unexpected concerns arise from additional data or analysis, if regulatory authorities require additional information or further studies, or if we were to encounter other unexpected hurdles.
For more detailed information on the risks and uncertainties associated with these forward looking statements and the Company's other activities see the periodic reports filed by the Company and Biogen, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

Presentation
Operator [1]
At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Idec fourth quarter and full-year earnings conference call. At this time, I want to turn the conference over to Ms. Elizabeth Woo, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am.
Elizabeth Woo, Biogen Idec  Senior Director of Investor Relations [2]
Thank you, Corey. Everyone, welcome to Biogen Idec's first post-merger earnings conference call for the fourth quarter and full-year 2003. I do want to offer our apologies for the press release being issued just a few minutes ago. As you know, with the merger, the financial tables have become more complex, and the logistics of uploading those tables to the news ervice took longer than expected.
So, in the meantime, before we begin the conference call, I urge everyone to go to the investor relations section of our web site, biogenidec.com, and to print out the press release with the accompanying tables. This will make it easier to follow along when Peter reviews the financial results. If you're not able to access the site, you can contact Rob Jacobson, at 617-679-3710, or Fran Dingle, at 617-679-3446. And either of those persons can e-mail you a copy of the release and the tables.
So, let me begin with the Safe Harbor statement. Comments made in this conference call include forward-looking statements regarding the Company's expectations, regarding future financial results and the development of the Company's pipeline products. Such statements are based on management's current expectations, and are subject to the risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially. In particular, careful consideration should be given to the risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release in the periodic reports filed by Biogen Idec  Biogen and Idec Pharmaceuticals  that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
 
Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements.
Today on the call, we will have Jim Mullen, our CEO, start with an overview and some opening comments. Then we will have Peter Kellogg, our CFO, walk through merger accounting and guidance. Followed by William Rohn, Chief Operating Officer, to briefly update you on commercial products. And then William Rastetter, Executive Chairman, will make some closing comments before we to the question-and-answer session.
For the question-and-answer session, Burt Adelman, our Executive Vice President of Development, will join us.
Given the complexity of the merger accounting, this call will go on a little longer than usual. And so, I am now going to hand the call over to Jim Mullen, for his comments.
Jim Mullen, Biogen Idec  Presdient, CEO [3]
Thank you, Elizabeth. Good afternoon everyone. I know many of you are just getting the press release, so let me just hit the headlines. Then, do a little bit of introduction and turn it over to Peter.
The pro forma combined 2003 revenues rose 19 percent. On a GAAP basis, the full-year 2003 earnings were a loss of $4.92 per share, and that is primarily due to the merger-related accounting. On an adjusted pro forma basis, the full-year 2003 earnings per share was $1.22. Probably the key numbers that people were trying to get grounded in. So, those are the headlines, now let me do a little bit of introduction and then Peter can walk you through the numbers.
Certainly, 2003 has been a transforming year for Biogen Idec since the completion of the merger late last year, we have had a string of successes in the product pipeline. For RITUXAN, the ECOG 1496 trial was stopped early for demonstrating efficacy of maintenance in indolent patients. For ANTEGREN, the current maintenance trial met its primary end-point. And in multiple sclerosis, we announced our intention to file with the FDA, based on the one-year data in the ANTEGREN trial. So, an exciting short period of time here.
I think these past four months of operating at Biogen Idec has confirmed the promise of our new company. Our overall business performance was strong over 1.85 billion in total revenues for the combined company with a top-line growth of 19 percent. This was led by RITUXAN, which continues to grow strongly and there is great promise to extend the indications within oncology, as well as in RA, where Phase III trials have started.
The AVONEX business was very solid, growing at 13 percent. AMEVIVE and ZEVALIN contributed another $60 million in revenue. So, with his with this projected growth trajectory in addition to our late-stage pipeline, where we have three compounds
 
in Phase III trials, we are confident that Biogen Idec is well-positioned to achieve our goal of delivering an average of 15 percent top-line and 20 percent bottom-line growth through 2007.
Now, looking beyond 2007, we've also completed a strong year in business development and with our internal discovery efforts. During 2003, of course, everybody remembers we launched AMEVIVE. But importantly, we also initiated this franchise in dermatology which was led by in-licensing of Phase III oral candidates.
In addition to that deal, we consummated several other important collaborations with Genentech, one for development of one or more new Humanized Anti-CD 20 antibodies for a broad ranges diseases. The second collaboration with Genentech on BAFF receptor, which is in the preclinical stage, and with CellTech, we joined a collaboration on molecules directed against the CD-40 ligand protein for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.
We expect to start trials in the least five new molecules  for example neublastin TGF beta, that come from our internal discovery efforts and we expect these starts to occur over the next 18 months.
In total, we have currently have 11 molecules in the clinic and many of these are in multiple indications.
With his combined research and development strength we have over 1000 researchers at Biogen Idec, and we're the third-largest R&D budget in the biotech industry.
Two weeks ago, Biogen Idec, along with our partners Elan , announced our intention to submit a BLA to the FDA for ANTEGREN and multiple sclerosis. This decision is based on the one-year data from the affirmed monotherapy and the Sentinel combination trial and discussions with the FDA. Let me just remind you  take you back and review what had to occur to warrant a filing based on one-year data. The affirmed monotherapy trial had to be consistent with the Phase II data and the Sentinel combination trial had to demonstrate meaningful benefit.
Now, I want to focus, really, on the current state of the MS market. I know a lot of people are beginning to think about that very carefully after this announcement two weeks ago. In the U.S., there are approximately 450,000 MS patients, of which 300, 350,000 relapsing forms. We consider that the eligible market. That market is slightly over half-penetrated. That is about 180,000 patients in the U.S. are on one of the interferons.
There is more than 50,000 quitters. That number is hard to quantify, but we think that is the right ballpark. There is about 10 to 15,000 new patients diagnosed, annually. And, what you think about the EU marketplace, you can pretty much just double up all those numbers, except the penetration is a little bit less. So, huge there's still a huge unmet need out there.
 
Now, ANTEGREN is a once-a-month IV infusion. We think this once-a-month administration is going to be very attractive to patients. IV drug administration isn't entirely new to the neurologists. Most are familiar with IVs, since they often use IV steroids to treat exacerbations. Nevertheless, the IV access will be a focus area for us with ANTEGREN. With our nine years of data and experience, I think we have information on every single urologist. And we have the largest patient database. Remember, in the U.S., about 5000 neurologists prescribe 90 percent of the business. The top 500 doctors comprise 36 percent of the total MS market, and these 500 are affiliate with MS centers and hospitals.
As we have said many times, we cannot discuss the data from the trials, because we need to protect the integrity of the two-year trial. However, we do believe that this innovative therapy will offer hope to a large number of patients and the market will grow significantly in the U.S. and Europe.
Our commercial organization in the U.S. is already gearing up. We're aiming to submit the filing, the BLA file by midyear. Once we have done that, we will update you  when we know and we have more clarity on the timing. Therefore, we have not reflected the accelerated launch of ANTEGREN in any of our forecasts or guidance that Peter will discuss later in the call.
The merger of Biogen and Idec has been a transforming event and it has positioned Biogen Idec to achieve significant growth with the potential to launch multiple novel products over the years to come. I think it is a very exciting start in just four months. I will now turn the call over to Peter Kellogg, to review the financial results.
Peter Kellogg, Biogen Idec  CFO, EVP of Finance [4]
Thank you, Jim. Since this is the first quarter in which our merger is reported, I would like to begin with a few comments to orient everyone to the merger accounting implications. As a reminder, the merger closed on the evening of November 12 and the results of the newly formed Biogen Idec are consolidated from that date onward.
For the period before November 12, the results only include those of the former IDEC Pharmaceuticals company. So, with 2003 being the transition year, we have two new impacts to incorporate. First, GAAP creates a series of merger-related accounting, which I'm sure you are all familiar with. Things like amortization of intangibles, in-process R&D write-offs, adjustments to the balance sheet values, etc. Secondly, due to the mid-quarter merger, the reported financials include only seven weeks of the former Biogen results. Accordingly, as attachments to our press release, we have included five tables. And, I would like to reiterate Elizabeth's point, which is, it would be very helpful if you could get your hands on those tables now, because I am going to use those to explain the GAAP and adjusted pro forma non-GAAP results.
 
The first two tables are straight GAAP results which we will always provide and of course, these are the most important. I like to draw your attention, also, though, to tables three and four for this discussion. These tables begin with the GAAP results, and then reconcile these reported GAAP financial results to an adjusted pro forma, non-GAAP result for the full quarter and for the full year, respectively.
Now, specifically on tables three and four I would like to walk you through each of the five columns, starting on the left. On the left, in column one, we have the GAAP results. These reflect IDEC Pharmaceuticals' full-year and Q4 results plus seven weeks, November 13th through December 31st, at Biogen, because as I mentioned earlier, our merger closed on November 12 in the evening. These are the results you will see in our 10-K and our annual report. Because many of the GAAP purchase accounting entries are not reflective of ongoing core operating performance, we have added the next column called adjustments and that is column two. These items are all of the nonoperating elements in the GAAP results in column one, that are non-recurring or unique to the merger. Extracting these from the GAAP results creates the adjusted non-GAAP column, or column three.
Now, some of the analyst community has focused on this view, since it is a perspective that many other merged companies provide. However, it still reflects 52 weeks of Idec results only seven weeks of Biogen results, on an operating basis. So, because of that, it is not a particularly helpful base for analysis of future year performance. So, we'd added the fourth column, Biogen operating pre-merger or column four. Now, this reflects the operating results of Biogen for the first 45 weeks of 2003  that is the pre-merger operating results that are excluded from GAAP. Now, when you add column four to column three, you get the last column  adjusted pro forma non-GAAP. These figures reflect what the Biogen and Idec results would have been like, had it been one entity for the full quarter and the full-year, on an adopting basis, excluding all merger-related accounting and non-recurring, nonoperating impact. So, as I review the P&L opening performance of Biogen Idec, I am going to talk about column five, the adjusted pro forma non-GAAP, because we believe it better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our integrated business.
After that discussion, I will circle back and walk you through the reconciliation items that bridge the GAAP results to the adjusted pro forma non-GAAP performance. But, let me first focus on this fifth column  adjusted pro forma non-GAAP, beginning with total product revenues.
In the fourth quarter, total product revenues were $332 million, and on a full-year basis, the product revenues were $1.229 billion. Now product revenues are comprised of AVONEX, AMEVIVE, and ZEVALIN. For reference, the product-specific details are also provided in tables five. Now, let me cover these in order. In the fourth quarter, AVONEX product sales were $310 million. That is a 21 percent increase over prior year. Now, since we pre-announced this result on February 11, this is not a surprise, but it is an outstanding result. Conversion to pre-filled syringe was essentially completed by year-end, and inventory levels at year-end, were if anything below our normal 1.5 weeks.
 
On a full-year basis, AVONEX product sales were $1.168 billion, delivering a growth of 13 percent as Jim mentioned. What a great year!
Now, William Rohn will follow me with more comments on all of these products and the commercial trends and activities that are driving these results. But, just to comment on this AVONEX year, I very much doubt that any of us internally or externally, would have predicted this strength. It is a true testament to the power of our MS field organization worldwide. Congratulations are due to them.
Just to round out the AVONEX results, on a geographic basis, the U.S. fourth quarter AVONEX product sales were $211 million, up 15 percent, and on a full-year basis, the U.S. AVONEX product sales were $800 million  that is an 8 percent increase.
Turning to international business, international  or AVONEX outside the U.S. in the fourth quarter, revenues were $99 million, and that is up 37 percent versus prior year. Now, AVONEX's fourth quarter sales growth in local currency, was 20 percent. And, of course, we had a 17-point benefit from foreign exchange. So growth in U.S. dollars came in at the 37 percent growth rate that I just mentioned.
Now, this growth was primarily driven by 18 percent unit growth in our direct markets  and just for example, Germany was up 23 percent, France was up 27 percent, and the UK was up 54 percent, all in units.
These are all markets where the investments we have talked about over the last 1.5 years or two are paying off with excellent results.
So, in total, our international AVONEX sales for the full-year of 2003 were $368 million, up 27 percent.
Turning to AMEVIVE, our fourth quarter AMEVIVE product sales were 17 million, which leads us to a full-year AMEVIVE result of 40 million. Now, during Q4 the AMEVIVE business continued to expand, as our operating model settled in. As we look forward to 2004, we expect to see AMEVIVE continue to grow, although with the competitive launches of other products, such as Raptiva and Embrel, we do expect the 2004 quarterly growth to be a little bit lumpy as we go from quarter-to-quarter.
ZEVALIN, in the fourth quarter, delivered $5 million of sales. And, on a full-year basis, ZEVALIN product sales were $20 million. So, that completes the total product revenue line on our P&L.
Our RITUXAN collaboration revenues come next, which is titled unconsolidated joint business. In the fourth quarter, the revenues from that were $130 million. Now, this has several elements which I am sure you have followed in the past as you have watched that business. First, we receive our share of the U.S. RITUXAN profits. RITUXAN sales, as you know, were $369 million in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, and our Q4 profit share
 
from that business was $117 million. As a reference, this is an increase of 19 percent versus prior year. That is pretty good. Secondly, we received royalty revenue on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S.. In Q4, this was $21 million, or an increase of 52 percent versus prior year.
Third, we are reimbursed for selling and development costs incurred related to RITUXAN. That was $5 million in Q4.
Fourth, and this is a new item, we purchased RITUXAN clinical data from Roche for $9 million and this data will be helpful for future filings.
Finally, we incurred a unique royalty expense in Q4 of $3 million, for payment of prior year obligations against the Columbia Axel  and this covered the years 1997 to 2001. Now, is important to note as you look at the RITUXAN result, that these last two items totaling $12 million are unusual and non-recurring. On a full-year basis, our unconsolidated joint business was  revenue from that was $493 million. And that, of course, was driven by a total U.S. net sales reported by Genentech in 2003 of $1.36 billion.
Now, moving to royalties in the fourth quarter, that was $27 million. This reflects most notably a decline in the royalties received on Intron-A, which Schering-Plough has attributed to the competitive dynamics that they are experiencing. On a full-year basis, royalties were $127 million, and that is a 12 percent increase over prior year.
And then finally, we had corporate partner revenue, which in Q4 was about $3 million and on a full-year basis $4 million. So, that leads us to our total revenue line of $491 million  and that is in the fourth quarter. And then, on a full-year basis, the total revenue line was $1.852 billion  that's a 19 percent revenue group over the same period last year, as Jim mentioned. So, this is a great top-line strength. And now, as we move to the costs in the P&L, you will note that the adjustments are more sizable, and this is due to the magnitude of the merger-related charges in opening balance sheet markup. In the fourth quarter, our costs-of-sales were $79 million. And, on a full-year basis, it was $231 million. Now, on a full-year basis, that is 12 percent of revenues. But in the fourth quarter, it is 16 percent of revenue. As you might expect, we did incur some inventory write-offs in Q4  mostly in AVONEX and ZEVALIN. And these totaled $28 million on a pre-merger basis. This is what caused cost-of-sales to be higher in Q4, compared to the full-year results.
Now, if these problems continue, we would likely have to incur additional charges. And potentially could experience some interruption of supply in AVONEX.
For the fourth quarter, R&D was $165 million, or 34 percent of revenue. On a full-year basis, R&D was $546 million, or 30 percent of revenues.
As we have noted when we announced this merger, our R&D spending now exceeds $500 million, making our R&D programs one of the strongest in biotechnology.
 
Our long-range planning process that we completed his past fall, confirmed that as a combined entity, Biogen Idec will be able to operate with 25 percent more pipeline than the two companies would have independently. In the fourth quarter, SG&A was $137 million, and that is 28 percent of revenue. On a full-year basis, the SG&A line was $508 million or 27 percent of revenue. The biggest driver in the growth of this line over prior year, is the addition of our dermatology sales force in 2003.
Other income expenses in the fourth quarter was $16 million. Taxes were $39 million in the fourth quarter. That is a 31 percent tax rate versus PBT.
So, that leads us to the adjusted pro forma EPS of 24 cents in the fourth quarter. But on a full-year basis, the adjusted pro forma EPS was $1.22.
Now, we recognize that this result establishes an important base for Biogen to grow from. From this base, we have targeted, as we have mentioned many times, a 15 percent topline revenue average growth goal for the next four years and a 20 percent adjusted EPS average growth goal for the next four years.
We feel that this will be the most helpful starting point in metrics to gauge our operate results.
Because we recognize the importance of earnings computed with GAAP and in accordance with Regulation G, I would like to walk-through table 3 in our press release that reconciles our GAAP P&L to the adjusted pro forma non-GAAP performance that we just discussed. These tables break out the reconciliation by major driver and by P&L line item. We will continue to provide such reconciliation tables in all of our quarterly earnings releases for the year. Let me briefly take you through the reconciliation on a pretax basis, for the 2003 fourth quarter. These reconciling items account for the difference between our adjusted pro forma result of 24 cents per share, as noted in table 3, and the GAAP number.
So, I'm just going to quickly walk through the footnotes. Footnote A, as you go through this, is to remove all of the revenue and expenses from the former Biogen, prior to the merger. Footnote B, deducts $233 million to include the non-cash expense related to valuing the inventory acquired from the former Biogen at fair value. This impact is driven by the fact that the inventory of AVONEX and AMEVIVE, acquired as of November 12, was marked up to fair market value per GAAP. This increases cost-of-sales dramatically and increases the impact of the inventory write-off that happens subsequently.
Now, footnote C relates only to the full-year chart and it just includes the $21 million one-time signing payment made to Genentech earlier in the year, in association with the new Anti-CD 20 antibody development collaboration program. Footnote D, as we add that in, going from right to left from column five over, that includes $3 million of external and incremental consulting and integration costs  Footnote E includes $10
 
million in onetime severance and restructuring charges. Footnote F includes a onetime, non-cash expense of $823 million, associated with writing off the value of of acquired in-process R&D from the former Biogen pipeline. Footnote G includes the ongoing non-cash amortization of acquired intangible assets. AVONEX and AMEVIVE. This amortization was $33 million in Q4. Footnote H includes a $31 million onetime charge associated with legal settlements and shareable donations.
And finally Footnote I includes the net tax effect of all of the above adjustments.
Now, just as a final point of calculation, because merger accounting is complex  the diluted shares outstanding used to arrive at the GAAP EPS is the weighted average average shares outstanding over the course of the quarter or the year. We have provided this figure for each of the EPS calculations on these tables.
I realize that this is a complicated discussion, and we hope that these very complete tables provided will help the investment community to understand the GAAP as well as the operating base for the newly formed Biogen Idec. And I will certainly be glad to answer any questions that this raises in the Q&A session that follows.
Now, as Jim mentioned, a great deal of operating integration has occurred over the last quarter. And I am pleased report that the synergy savings anticipated when we originally announced this merger are all achievable and on-track. Additionally, the goals that we provided last June for the four-year average growth rates are also in-line. As the laid out, total revenues are targeted to grow 15 percent, on average, per year and adjusted EPS is targeted to grow 20 percent per year, on average. If we meet these goals, Biogen Idec should reach a total revenue level of over $3.25 billion and an adjusted EPS above $2.60 in 2007. That is more than doubling our EPS in four years.
Included in these targets is an R&D assumption that we in-license at least one Phase I or Phase II product every year and a Phase II product every other year. Now, I know one question you all ask is our projected tax rate and we estimate that the effective tax rate of the combined entity, going forward, will be in the 31 to 33 percent range over that time period.
Now, turning to 2004. We are comfortable applying our total revenue growth goal for the first year. With the recent announcement of our filing for ANTEGREN approval later this year, we will be accelerating some launch preparation costs in 2004. Now, we believe that you will agree, that this is a great turn of events. It provides tremendous potential for the Company. However, it does make providing specific EPS guidance a little difficult. We are comfortable with the range that most analyst estimates are centered around, which is $1.50, plus or minus 5 or 7 cents and that is a reasonable range, but it really has not factored in the ANTEGREN news.
Once we get a better feel for the FDA dialogue and timing, we will update this short-term outlook. However, this news further supports our objective of delivering 20 percent EPS growth over four years. And so we're pretty excited about it.
 
As of Q1, 2004  just as a note  we have diluted shares outstanding of 362 million shares. This is a reasonable level to use for forward planning.
Just as a reminder, this includes the impact of our liens and other dilutive securities. Which means that to calculate our EPS, you need to add back the net interest expense from these liens  that information is also provided in tables three and four.
Just an additional point to note. We expect that our capital spending will range between 325 and $400 million in 2004 and this is driven by completion of NIMO (ph), and the consolidated West Coast R&D facility and Nobel. This is higher than we would anticipate to be normal for the years following 2004. Accordingly, we anticipate having a healthy operating cash flow, averaging about $500 million per year over the next four years. While our already healthy cash position is very strong, we have decided that a share repurchase program is appropriate. Effective immediately, we are announcing a new share repurchase program, which our Board of Directors recently authorized, for the repurchase of up to 12 million shares to be funded entirely by operating cash flow and the cash flow benefit of options exercises. The purchase  the purpose of this plan is to service the employee stock option and stock purchase plan, assuring share stabilization during 2004 and 2005.
So, in conclusion, this merger has solidified the growth outlook for Biogen Idec in the terms of growing the P&L and also in terms of providing the resources to build our pipeline. With the momentum provided by ANTEGREN, RITUXAN, and leverage from the merger, we are confident of achieving our growth goals and are committed to excellence in our R&D pipeline. Thank you.
Now, I would like to hand off to William Rohn, our Chief Operating Officer, who will provide a more in-depth commercial review. Bill?
William Rohn, Biogen Idec  COO, EVP [5]
Thanks, Peter. Let me begin my remarks with AVONEX, which continues to perform above everyone's expectations. We have been very pleased that the AVONEX franchise posted double-digit growth in 2003 of 13 percent. In the U.S., revenues exceeded 800 million, an increase of 7.7 percent. Unit volume was steady in 2003.
After competing with Serano and Pfizer for the last two years, AVONEX market share remains in the mid to upper 40 percent range. Our success in the marketplace is due, in large part, to our long-term relationships  nine years now, with doctors, which is forged by our sales force and of course, with the patients.
Our goal, going forward, is to have as strong a base as possible from which to launch ANTEGREN.
 
Our international business has demonstrated strong unit growth on top of benefits from foreign exchange. Ex-U.S. revenue amounted to 360 million, an increase of 27 percent.
Both in the U.S. and internationally, there is growing support for long-term efficacy tied to low neutralizing antibodies. A number of important MS organizations have issued consensus statements on neutralizing antibodies that reinforce our messages. We will continue to leverage this growing body of data.
The most exciting for the MS community is, of course, ANTEGREN. Over the coming months, we will be working to optimize the positioning of both AVONEX and ANTEGREN, based on steady results, which have yet to be presented. Jim has already commented extensively on ANTEGREN. So, suffice it to say, we are in a very active planning mode, to make sure we are ready for an early product launch, should be before she have to receive a timely review, from the FDA.
Moving on to AMEVIVE, with $40 million in revenue in 2003, our efforts in 2004 continue to focus on building breadth and depth. The breadth of our prescribing base continues to grow, while the depth of prescribing among our top one-third of doctors, is steadily increasing.
On an operational basis, we are focused on improving our conversion rate and time, getting more of the patients that have indicated an interest in initiating treatment onto AMEVIVE, in a shorter period of time.
We are also communicating and leveraging the Medicare J-Code  20 percent of the psoriasis population is Medicare-eligible and AMEVIVE is the only biologic reimbursed for this population.
Strategically, we see this market evolving towards combination use. At the recent AAD, we presented data on a range of studies of AMEVIVE in combination with other therapies such as Methotrexate, Cyclosporin, and phototherapy. These data suggest that other therapies may be used as induction, followed by AMEVIVE as consolidation and/or maintenance of response, similar to the RITUXAN model. AMEVIVE provides a great alternative to the other chronic-dosing therapies.
Turning now to ZEVALIN, we are pleased that our partner Schearing AG, received marketing approval in the EU during January. And, on the reimbursed front, we believe the changes in Medicare are positive for ZEVALIN and, will provide a more stable basis for 2004. Hospitals will experience an acceptable margin on ZEVALIN and will earn additional reimbursement for services related to administration and gamma camera scans.
Importantly, the wage index issue has gone away. Also behind us is the litigation with Corixa and GSK. I am sure you all saw the announcement on Monday, regarding the settlement of all issues.
 
Finally, we continue to work on repositioning the product with a vast array of new Phase IV studies, looking at ZEVALIN as an alternative to aggressive combination chemotherapy, as well as a valuable therapy and relapsed aggressive NHL.
RITUXAN continues to perform well, growing at 26 percent to 1.36 billion in the U.S. Of course, we have penetration in all key subsegments. The product continues to be the market-leader for use in the indolent NHL setting. And in fact, we and our partner, Genentech, intend to file the RITUXAN plus CVP Frontline indolent data with the FDA this year. And Roche will also submit this data to the EMEA for label expansion.
While our sales force does not promote RITUXAN in aggressive NHL or CLL or maintenance, RITUXAN has been established as a significant therapy in all of these settings.
Re-treatment also continues to be a source of growth. The large base of patients that have taken RITUXAN as Frontline therapy provides an increasing pool of patients eligible for re-treatment.
Historically, the revenues from maintenance have been quite small. In 2003, we estimate that only about 50 to 60 million of sales actually came from the maintenance therapy modality. The body of data in this area is growing, especially in low-grade disease. As you know, ECOG 1496 was stopped early, in November, for efficacy reasons. By the way, just as a reminder, these were indolent patients, who receive CVP as their induction regimen, and then were randomized to RITUXAN maintenance versus observation. We look forward to the data being presented at ASCO this year.
Turning finally, to reimbursement. Many of you have asked how the new Medicare reimbursement scheme is going to change prescribing habits. Clearly, oncologists are concerned about how this legislation impacts their practice economics. However, given RITUXAN's unique clinical benefit and broad utilization in NHL and CLL protocols, all supported by either the package insert, peer review literature or Compendia listing  as a result, we anticipate a limited impact on actual usage patterns, perhaps only minor changes at the margins.
Nevertheless, we will continue to monitor the situation closely.
So, in summary for RITUXAN, based on the data from the more than 270 abstracts, posters and oral presentations, given at ASH, we expect RITUXAN will continue to grow in 2004 from increased use in a wide range of clinical settings.
Let me now turn the call over to William Rastetter for some concluding remarks before Q&A. Bill?
William Rastetter, Biogen Idec  Chairman [6]
 
Thanks, Bill. I would like to wrap up with a few comments before we turn the call back over to Elizabeth for your questions. I commented to Jim just the other day that it seems that we're now leading a company rather than managing a merger. The merger and integration piece has worked remarkably well, thanks to a tremendous amount of ownership and planning from many, many people at Biogen Idec. But also thanks to a common vision that we have embraced for our new company. That common vision entails several elements. Number one, increasing the R&D investment over what we could do with separate companies and increasing the percentage of the R&D spend that goes into strategic investments, namely discovery, research and clinical trials.
Number two, becoming a partner of choice for the companies in the fields of oncology, neurology, dermatology and rheumatology to leverage our development, manufacturing, and commercial infrastructures to in-licensed products.
Number three, continuing to build a Biogen Idec as one of the world's premier biotech companies with special emphasis on making the Company a great place for creative people to develop careers in the translation of science in the innovative therapies
And four, to continue to grow the value of the company for our shareholders through good year-after-year financial performance.
The early filing of ANTEGREN, of course, is another step in fulfilling this vision. This product might be launched as early as 2005 out of our manufacturing capacity and Research Triangle Part. But, we are also in an enviable position to also utilize our new manufacturing capacity in Oceanside, California for ANTEGREN supply. Thus, ANTEGREN launch will benefit strategic investment in two ways. First, we remain committed to investing roughly (technical difficulty) percent of our topline back into R&D. Increased revenues will drive more investment. But also, increased capacity utilization for ANTEGREN will decrease the unproductive charge to R&D for unutilized manufacturing capacity. R&D spend will not only go up, but it will also be more strategic.
And, of course, we would hope to do all of this, while also meeting our guidance for financial performance that Peter shared with you, earlier in the call.
Thanks for your support, as we continue to fulfill our vision for Biogen Idec. I would like now to turn the call back to Elizabeth.
Elizabeth Woo, Biogen Idec  Senior Director of Investor Relations [7]
Thank you, Bill. Operator, if you could open the queue to begin the question-and-answer session. I would ask that each of you limit your questions to one or two to allow your colleagues to get in their questions and if you have or questions, you can re-enter the queue. So, operator, if you're prepared, we can take the first question. And, I ask that you state your name and company affiliation. Thank you.
 
Questions and Answers
Operator [1]
Joel Sendek, Lazard.
Joel Sendek, Lazard Freres & Co. LLC  Analyst [2]
With regard to the $2.50 you mentioned for 2007  just going back to one of your earlier comments, does that not assume that ANTEGREN will be approved in the 2005  or as early as 2005?
Peter Kellogg, Biogen Idec  CFO, EVP of Finance [3]
This is Peter Kellogg. So, you know, by the time  at this point is awfully hard  let me start over  we've always assumed that ANTEGREN would be a product our portfolio and it would be approvable and successful. As you get out to 2007 that's always been a base assumption that we've had. At this point, it is a little bit early to update that in any way, since we are just very early in this whole process. So, I guess the two points I would answer that is, yes, the goals that we have as a company have always included ANTEGREN as a successful product. And, at this point it is far too early to update those particularly, one way or the other. Bill, any comments from your standpoint?
William Rastetter, Biogen Idec  Chairman [4]
No, Peter, I think that really covers it. Obviously, great news on the earlier possibility for filing and hopefully approval. We'll be into the marketplace sooner. That is going generate revenue and profit faster. And I think we're going through the refined planning process at this point in time. And perhaps later in the year we'll be in a position to give more refinement on the guidance.
Joel Sendek, Lazard Freres & Co. LLC  Analyst [5]
Okay. Just as a follow-up to that, if I may, when you give the  if you can pin down exactly when the filing will happen and when you potentially will get the response from that filing  will that offer up a potential opportunity for you to increase the guidance beyond what it is today?
Peter Kellogg, Biogen Idec  CFO, EVP of Finance [6]
 
I will tell you at this point that it is a little bit early for me to indicate that. So, we have not really gotten that far along. At this point, I would just it is very early in the process. So we feel great, very encouraged and as I said this, if anything, just supports our commitment more than ever. I think it's a little early to be talking about  we're still on the 15 percent topline, 20 percent bottom line. We think that is going to be great. And I think the other great part of that news is that, you know, as a combined company, we will be able to afford to deliver those results and afford a very strong R&D pipeline, as Bill mentioned. And I think that is the key to having a continuous operating machine that will be very powerful. That is our plan for now.
Operator [7]
Geoffrey Porges, Sanford Bernstein.
Geoffrey Porges, Sanford Bernstein  Analyst [8]
Thanks for taking my questions. Another follow-up question on ANTEGREN. In your opening comments, Jim, I think you were talking about the FDA  FDA's conclusions about the ANTEGREN combination study and the implication that that showed significant benefit. Could you clarify that the implication  that the combination in fact showed significant benefit? Or is it just that the data was consistent with the Phase II data for the single (indiscernible)?
Burt Adelman, Biogen Idec  EVP of Development [9]
Yeah, this is Burt Adelman. I will answer that question and remind everyone that we have, at this meeting, and in another occasions, clearly stated that we are not prepared to discuss in detail, the results of those trials, at this time, because they're still ongoing. Nonetheless, I would say that, you know, we presented to the FDA, results from two trials that they felt were adequate to support a filing, based on one-year data.
Geoffrey Porges, Sanford Bernstein  Analyst [10]
Okay. So, there is no more color than that?
Burt Adelman, Biogen Idec  EVP of Development [11]
No.
Geoffrey Porges, Sanford Bernstein  Analyst [12]
 
Okay. Bye.

Jennifer Chao, RBC Capital Markets.
Jennifer Chao, RBC Capital Markets  Analyst [14]
Just again on ANTEGREN. If you could maybe just give us a little bit more color all the extent to which FDA had opportunity vett the ANTEGREN data before a file decision was made to file early  what the likelihood to believe there is for an accelerated six-month review? And then, if someone could just address manufacturing capacity and where you would expect to be on capacity by the early 05 time frame? And how exactly that scales up? Thanks.
Peter Kellogg, Biogen Idec  CFO, EVP of Finance [15]
Okay, so  again, I think to be consistent with what we have said since the inception of the Phase III ANTEGREN program in MS  we have always said that the trials were designed with a one-year analysis that was discussed with the FDA in advance of the initiation of the trials, so that we understood what they would want to see in terms of data and analyses that would enable them to determine whether or not we had adequately compelling data to warrant their support of our filing at the end of the one year period. So, you know, I think that is all the color that I can give you. I mean, they  we  there was a well-defined statistical analysis plan. It was agreed to in advance of commencement of the trials. And, we basically followed that roadmap leading up to this discussion with the agency.
Bill, will answer the questions about supply.
William Rastetter, Biogen Idec  Chairman [16]
Jennifer, with regard to manufacturing supply, I guess if there is any evidence of why this was a really strategically good merger, it is probably  really being underscored by what is going on with ANTEGREN here. Because, certainly the registration lots that will be submitted as part of the BLA, were made at Research Triangle Park. That facility is large-scale and has sufficient capacity, obviously, to meet market needs in the early years. But, importantly, the facility that Heritage Idec was building in Oceanside, provides us with tremendous expansion capacity to be able to serve global demand, even on some wildly aggressive scenarios. So, we will clearly initiating campaigns and we are in a good position to receive the FDA for preapproval inspections in a timely way in
 
Research Triangle Park. And then later, we will be qualifying the process and bringing onstream in an appropriate and timely way, capacity at the Oceanside facility that we have referred to as NIMO
Jennifer Chao, RBC Capital Markets  Analyst [17]
That is perfect. Burt, if you could just  your thoughts on a potential six-month review process?
Burt Adelman, Biogen Idec  EVP of Development [18]
You know, I just  at this point in time, I cannot really comment. Because we have not actually submitted an application.

Craig Parker, Lehman Brothers  Analyst [20]
I will give you a little bit of a break from MS questions. Burt, I think, on the last call, you had suggested that you were very enthusiastic about talking to the FDA about the Crohn's study  the maintenance study. Are you still proceeding with that  and, still suggesting that you might actually file with just the maintenance data?
Burt Adelman, Biogen Idec  EVP of Development [21]
No, I don't think that, and I recall my comments, previously  and I know why did not say we would file just with the maintenance data. You know, we believe that in the U.S., you're going to need two trials. Whether that is an induction trial and a maintenance trial, or two maintenance trials  I am not 100 percent sure. We are starting another induction trial that, like, you know, many other studies that you read about, is designed understanding how, with the, you know, lots of therapy out there in Crohn's we have come to better understand how to construct an induction trial.
In terms of  so that  so I don't see an early filing for Crohn's with the FDA. We'll have some conversations in Europe. But again, it's too premature to really know at this point in time.
Craig Parker, Lehman Brothers  Analyst [22]
 
And we've heard that the MS data might be presented at the AAN in April. Can you confirm that?
Burt Adelman, Biogen Idec  EVP of Development [23]
No I don't think  I haven't heard that.

Yeah. No, that's why is very important for the trials to continue until their two-year conclusion. Because, the disability data  you know, historically it takes two years to gather adequate disability data. And, we would very much want to have the EDSS data at the end of two years of therapy. So, you know, EDSS scores would not be part of an early submission.

Yes, you mention some manufacturing issues in AVONEX. Would you care to provide us more information on this?
William Rohn, Biogen Idec  COO, EVP [31]
Meirav, this is William Rohn. You know, I think it is related to the fact that we have introduced a new liquid formulation. And, we have experienced some variability in manufacturing. Peter mentioned that we had written off some (indiscernible) last year in the fourth quarter. We are working to resolve these issues. We think we understand the issue. But, I think we are just being cautious by bringing it to your attention for consideration.
Meirav Chovav, UBS Warburg  Analyst [32]
Okay. Thank you.

Dennis Harp, Deutsche Bank  North America  Analyst [34]
Actually, I just wanted to follow-up on that because I thought Peter's comment was that there was some risk of supply interruption. How big is that risk as you assess it? And then, the follow-up question would be  on the guidance, of $1.50 plus or minus 5 or 7 cents, I mean, how big is the ANTEGREN pre-launch spend that the we should be anticipating and how much lower could that number be?
Burt Adelman, Biogen Idec  EVP of Development [35]
With regard to the risk, I wouldn't want to speculate on trying to gauge risk at this point in time. Just, suffice it to say that we are working to resolve the manufacturing variability issues. We think we understand what the issue is and, once again, we are just being cautious by bringing it to your attention for your consideration. Peter, you want to ?
Peter Kellogg, Biogen Idec  CFO, EVP of Finance [36]
Dennis, I guess the point I wanted to make  thank you for raising  bringing it up  if ANTEGREN had been on more of a two-year plan and so forth, we were very
 
comfortable with the guidance range (indiscernible). And I think your question is going to be  well, how much, you know, how much cost might you bring forward from 05 and 04? So, I think I want to be cautious because it is really early days still. It is a question that we have and we are really too far and early in the process. The one thing we are sensitive to is we did not want to be staking out some hard guidance for 04 without recognizing that hey, it may change because we do have a very interesting project on our hands. Obviously, I mean, obviously, the one advantage we have with something like ANTEGREN is that we are in the MS space. We have a call center operation. We have what we think is the world's greatest sales force worldwide. And, you know, everyone is chomping at the bit.
That said, you know, it is really very, very early. It is very highlighted  we are at the early stage of the first point. So, the point we want to make was that we feel very comfortable with the first-year topline growth goal. And, had we been on a normal trajectory the bottom line 20 percent growth would have been fine. I think this is a new piece of information that we just want to get a little more information on and calibrate into our logic for 2004. Bill, would you add anything?
William Rastetter, Biogen Idec  Chairman [37]
No, I think that covers it Peter.
Dennis Harp, Deutsche Bank  North America  Analyst [38]
Do you have a sense of when you might be able to refine that guidance?
Peter Kellogg, Biogen Idec  CFO, EVP of Finance [39]
Burt, do you want to 
Burt Adelman, Biogen Idec  EVP of Development [40]
I was going to say, as we said, we anticipate filing in midyear. And, I think, you know, that is when you really put all of that in front of the regulatory agency. I think that will give us a much better sense as to what the timing will be for review and possible approval. Similarly, obviously, we're going to take these data to Europe and sit down with the rapiteur at the EMEA, and understand whether they would be willing to receive an application based on the one-year data. I'm sure that that will be a slightly different review cycle. But also be ahead of historic projections that we have been working on. So, you know, when we have all of that information in hand, I think then, Peter and Bill will be in much better position to understand how to ramp up our expenses.
 
Jim Mullen, Biogen Idec  Presdient, CEO [41]
This is Jim Mullen. There's another consideration here. The commercial teams are really just getting started looking at this information and thinking about it. And, you have to remember that we are also working closely with Elan on this. So it's a little more complex than it might be, typically. And, also, we do have to get to  whatever plans we come to, we have got to get to agreement with Elan. But that has worked extremely well in the last year or year and a half. So, I expect that that can happen relatively quickly. After the commercial teams have some adequate time to really think about the information.
And the other point is, the impact on Biogen Idec is half of whatever we decide to do and the other half goes to Elan. So, if that helps you gauge at all.

Eric Schmidt, SG Cowen Securities  Analyst [43]
Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could comment a little further, Jim, on the position of ANTEGREN? It seems, based in the way you describe the affirm and sentinel studies, this would surely be a first-line agent. Is there any reason to think it would not be?
Jim Mullen, Biogen Idec  Presdient, CEO [44]
I'm not sure we are really in the position to comment on how we want to do the positioning. And it is really for two reasons  because that starts to lead us down into data. Because the follow-on question to whatever I say is why do you think that? And secondly, the commercial teams literally have not had but a few days to look at it. And, I would prefer to get the answer from the experts than for the CEO to speculate  that almost always gets me in trouble with my organization.
Eric Schmidt, SG Cowen Securities  Analyst [45]
Fair enough. I know there is a lot of concern  at least on Wall Street  that ANTEGREN is going to cannibalize AVONEX. Could you just (multiple speakers)
Jim Mullen, Biogen Idec  Presdient, CEO [46]
 
Let me  I will say one thing about that  we've been telling you guys that for two years. The question is, we've got a bigger pie here. It's certainly going to cannibalize it under virtually any circumstance. But, you know, we think that with a larger pie here  of MS  and with the whole MS franchise, every outcome is a positive for us. Burt?
Burt Adelman, Biogen Idec  EVP of Development [47]
I would agreed with that  but to add as I know that Jim and I  at various times have taken you through. We feel that there is actually a very significant population of patients who are currently either off therapy, failing therapy, or not willing to take any of the current therapies. So, although, you know, if the drug is tremendously effective, it is certainly going to compete with existing therapies. I think it is very important to remember that there is, in our mind, a very large currently unserved segment of the MS population for whom this will be a therapy that they can now consider.
Eric Schmidt, SG Cowen Securities  Analyst [48]

Sandeep Bhatia, Piper Jaffray.
Sandeep Bhatia, Piper Jaffray  Analyst [50]
Thanks for taking the question. Jim, you mentioned in your opening remarks that one of the bars you had for filing early for ANTEGREN was is affirm trial was consistent with Phase II data. Did you mean consistent in both efficacy and side effect profiles? Can you comment if there was any serious side effect that you saw in affirm that was not seen in Phase II? Do you do a longer treatment?
Jim Mullen, Biogen Idec  Presdient, CEO [51]
Yeah, what I said, and I said it because we have been having this discussion for probably a year and a half as people thought about one year filing  well, what would have to be true? And the first thing that had to be true was that the affirm trial needed to confirm, in essence, the Phase IIB trial which was almost exactly the same design in terms of blinding, but obviously run for a shorter period of time. And, you also had to see a significant benefit of the combination trial. You know, in that whole equation, of course, is always the risk-benefit. And so, you had to have benefit but the risk could not
 
meaningfully change. And I think that's where we think we are, which is we have not seen anything  anything (indiscernible) Burt, do you want to  ?
Burt Adelman, Biogen Idec  EVP of Development [52]
Yeah, I would just agree with that. Obviously, a different drug is going to have a different mechanization  it's going to have a different adverse event profile. But obviously, to be filing early, we've got to have a significant and reassuring data set to support the contention that this is a therapy with an adequate risk-benefit ratio to be approved.
Jim Mullen, Biogen Idec  President, CEO [53]
It's something like 27, 2800 patients that have been exposed to the therapy between all of the trials and certainly the FDA has  considers the safety profile of it, along with the efficacy. They would never comment otherwise.
Sandeep Bhatia, Piper Jaffray  Analyst [54]
Okay, then just a quick question for Peter. In table 3, Footnote B, you seem to have deducted royalties related to Corixa settlement in the fourth quarter. Can you make a quick comment on that?
Peter Kellogg, Biogen Idec  CFO, EVP of Finance [55]
Sure. That is a good question. The Corixa settlement was largely captured down in Footnote H which captures legal settlements. However, because the Corixa settlement does relate to the intellectual property on ZEVALIN and Corixa, there's a small portion  a small portion  of that settlement which actually relates to prior year royalties  as if they had been paid. So that is all. It's a fairly minor point under that point B. Does that make sense?
Sandeep Bhatia, Piper Jaffray  Analyst [56]
Yeah, and would you be deducting the $20 million from the adjusted numbers going forward  payment in first quarter?
Unidentified Speaker [57]
(multiple speakers)
 
Sandeep Bhatia, Piper Jaffray  Analyst [58]
(Multiple Speakers) Legal settlement?
Peter Kellogg, Biogen Idec  CFO, EVP of Finance [59]
No, that legal settlement  okay, I understand your question. This is a legal issue that existed as of 12/31. And the issue on 12/31 was that the quantification of that issue was not determinable at that point. But, before the filing of the 10-K, it has now become determinable. So, it is a pre-existing legal situation. And so, as we have now not yet filed the 10-K, it becomes a subsequent event and therefore is included in the Q4 financials for 2003, not in the first quarter this year. So, in fact, the settlement amount is in the GAAP numbers. And, they are part of the adjustments moving from left to right, that  most of it is in Footnote H, as you move from left to right  we have adjusted it out, because what we tend to do is view these large legal settlements as kind of nonoperating onetime things. And we want to give something that gives you a sense of more what the operating ongoing businesses look like. Does that make sense?

When we might expect the Phase II data? How the Phase II trial is structured? And where you are in the Phase III psoriasis trials?

Well, yes. It's a basket of items. But yes, in general, we have certainly got all the trial expense that we are incurring, as we go through 04, 05, 06 in there. And we do have a launch time-frame that we have assumed. It is all, in our thinking, of course, probability-adjusted somewhat because it's still early Phase III. We don't bank on it 100 percent. But nonetheless, it is in our thinking.

Elise Wang, Smith Barney.
Elise Wang, Salomon Smith Barney  Analyst [71]
 
Thanks for taking my question. Could you remind us what the economic agreement that you have with Elan, and how we should look at how we model your respective shares of ANTEGREN in terms of both the revenues, as well as the associated costs?
Unidentified Speaker [72]
Peter?
Peter Kellogg, Biogen Idec  CFO, EVP of Finance [73]
So, fundamentally, the most important aspect is that the economics on the bottom line are split 50/50 with Elan. And, that is across all geographies and all indication  product indications. So we are really a partnership on this.
I will just note, and this is maybe actually a helpful point that in our filings related to the merger, we have actually articulated some of the agreement points which you can actually pick up  where you actually can see the logic of how the relationship works. What we have always advised people to think about is clearly first of all, most importantly, the bottom line is 50 percent. But we have assumed  asked everybody just to assume that something like 50 percent of the P&L will be running through our P&L. It's probably the simplest way to work  as we come closer to the final launch and so forth, we will be finalizing some of the elements of that. I will be working with my counterpart at Elan to kind of get it all buttoned up and tightened up and walk through with all of the details. But, for the time being, the way that I would think about is to assume we are getting 50 percent of the P&L.
Elise Wang, Salomon Smith Barney  Analyst [74]
Okay, so in other words, you are not going to be reporting revenues, per se, of ANTEGREN sales. It's just going to be somewhat of an AJV?
Peter Kellogg, Biogen Idec  CFO, EVP of Finance [75]
Well, no, I did not say that. We wouldn't be booking worldwide revenues at 100 percent. We would not be doing that. So, I would assume that something like 50 percent of the worldwide would be coming to our neighborhood  roughly half.
Elise Wang, Salomon Smith Barney  Analyst [76]
And then 50 percent of the costs too  is that how it works?
 
Peter Kellogg, Biogen Idec  CFO, EVP of Finance [77]
Right. Exactly. It may end up ultimately being a little different  just line items versus line items and we will fine-tune that. But, in general what we advise everybody is just assume, for sure, 50 percent of the bottom line and we suspect it will be roughly 50 percent of the top line.
Elise Wang, Salomon Smith Barney  Analyst [78]
If I recall, besides geography, it is also indication  is that correct, in terms of how the responsibilities are split?
Jim Mullen, Biogen Idec  Presdient, CEO [79]
Elise Wang this is Jim. The responsibilities are, well, we are sharing the total drug, in all indications, the economics are split, 50/50. What we have done, on an operational basis, is organize one company or the other to have the lead in certain parts  so for in development, we took the lead in MS. They have the lead in Crohn's. We've got the lead in the overall product manufacturing. At least at the (indiscernible) stage. They are taking the lead in RA for example. As we go to market, the way  you can read in the agreement, there's provisions that each company could, for example, in multiple sclerosis, I think it is  exactly the way the contract reads is that they could contribute up to 30 percent of the effort.
I think, as we move to the market, we are re-thinking those to really play to the strengths of the two companies. You know, the two companies are not the two companies that did the deal, to a certain extent, three years ago. Elan is a different shape than they were and we are a different shape than we were. We've got a great working relationship between the two companies. And, I think what we're trying to do is really sort of apply the logic of how do we create the maximum value for this product? Who exactly does the work should be decided on who's got the best infrastructure in a certain area. And if we should double up in an area, then we will double up in an area. So, I think some of those details are being worked through, literally now, particularly as the teams look at the launch strategy. And I think through the Crohn's data plus the MS (indiscernible)
Peter Kellogg, Biogen Idec  CFO, EVP of Finance [80]
Just to add onto that. That is the way we worked up to now as well. I mean, even in the trial area, we have kind of not worked equally, exactly 50/50 in each of the trials. We've had more of the lead role in MS. But they have had more the lead role in Crohn's and we have participated. But, when you work through the economics, we have a splitting-up
 
mechanism. So, we end up sharing 50/50 costs  even though two parties are playing different roles on the different trials.
Elise Wang, Salomon Smith Barney  Analyst [81]
Okay, then I gather there is a joint committee that really decides what type of spending levels you will allocate from commercialization in future R&D efforts?
Peter Kellogg, Biogen Idec  CFO, EVP of Finance [82]
Right, it is a very classic design, where we've got joint steering committee's, commercial committees  right down the line. And all different committees working. The great news, as Jim said, we have been working like this for quite some time. So, these committees are well-establish. Relationships are built and we anticipate a great, you know, great process to run this thing through.

Eric Ende, Merrill Lynch.
Eric Ende, Merrill Lynch  Analyst [84]
Thank you. I just want to get back to the AVONEX, or I should say potential AVONEX manufacturing issue. Are you still manufacturing the product? Or, is the plant shut down to fix the problems? That's the first question and the second part of that is, how much inventory do you have on-hand to really help assure us that there is not going to be a supply interruption? And the third part of that question is, if you need to change the process to fix that problem, do you think that it would require an FDA signoff?
Jim Mullen, Biogen Idec  Presdient, CEO [85]
Okay, this is Jim. It's now late in the day  I'm not even sure I remember all your questions, Eric. (laughter). Let me give it a shot. First, no, the plant shutdowns are not an issue. It is a very small technical issue that is causing, you know, a big problem, if you will. But, it is really on the (indiscernible) finish and it's now in the bulk. We are actually making bulk product at the North Carolina and here in Cambridge and that part of the process has generally run pretty smoothly. And the inventory level is there. I don't know what they are exactly off the top of my head. But, we would measure them in quarters. At least.
 
Eric Ende, Merrill Lynch  Analyst [86]
So, you would have multiple quarters of inventory (multiple speakers)
Jim Mullen, Biogen Idec  Presdient, CEO [87]
(Multiple Speakers) level. And at the fill finish level, we have inventory at both the (indiscernible) side and the liquid side. And the only thing the  the (indiscernible) process has been very solid over the years. And, you know, we will continue and we have been manufacturing some of that. And that is available for the marketplace  it continues to be available at some low level  but we can make it available at a higher level. And the liquid inventory. Right now liquid pre-filled syringe is the predominant form that is being sold in the marketplace. I would say the inventory levels on that are quite short. So, you know, those we would measure right now probably in weeks or a few months.
Peter Kellogg, Biogen Idec  CFO, EVP of Finance [88]
The correction of the problem  the important thing is I think we are sort of honed in on the problem. I think we can work through this situation. It implicates only one of the  we have got lots of bulk  the (indiscernible) formulation is not an issue. We've got some things that we're working through on the liquid side.
Eric Ende, Merrill Lynch  Analyst [89]
So you could always supply the market with the (indiscernible) formulation, then?
Jim Mullen, Biogen Idec  Presdient, CEO [90]
Yeah, but you know, stepping from one to the other requires a lot of ramping up and ramping down of different things, because that's not necessary how the production is right now planned. So, there is quite a number of variables in the air. And, I think we just have to work through them. Bill, I don't know if you have any other comments?
William Rastetter, Biogen Idec  Chairman [91]
No, Jim, I think you probably framed the issue pretty accurately. I think we are on the program and trying to address it. But, it is appropriate to call it out to your attention.

Burt Adelman, Biogen Idec  EVP of Development [94]

Thank you. Most of my questions have answered already. But, can you walk us through, once again, what the onetime charges were for exactly for RITUXAN revenue?
Peter Kellogg, Biogen Idec  CFO, EVP of Finance [98]
So, this is up in the consolidated joint venture line?
Jason Kantor, WR Hambrecht  Analyst [99]
That's right.
Peter Kellogg, Biogen Idec  CFO, EVP of Finance [100]
 
I'm just grabbing a piece of paper. The first one was  maybe I should let Bill answer that because I don't want to pretend like I've been working with this for years. But, the first one is that there was some clinical work done by Roche, in Europe. Very valuable work. Some of it was discussed in ASH (indiscernible) that is the first charge for $9 million. That was the (multiple speakers)  too many Bills in the room.
William Rastetter, Biogen Idec  Chairman [101]
You remember the study that Roche did  CVP induction versus CVP RITUXAN  it was a study that was funded by Roche. And because of the close relationship that Genentech in Biogen Idec share with Roche, we were able, after the fact, to purchase the data for purposes of U.S. filing. So that is what that is all about. Kind of nice being able after you see the results, to go back and buy data. That is a good place to be.
Peter Kellogg, Biogen Idec  CFO, EVP of Finance [102]
The second point that was in there that I mentioned was a $3 million charge for payment of prior year royalties and those relate to the original Columbia Axel patent. And so, those relate to the years 1997 to 2001. And so, that charge is pretty much a non-recurring. It's a catch-up of prior year obligations.
Jason Kantor, WR Hambrecht  Analyst [103]
So then, my other question is  when we think about ANTEGREN and the 50/50 arrangement with Elan, how should we think about that in terms of you have an existing sales force and infrastructure, selling into that market already. You know, clearly you're not going to double your sales force. So, you're basically getting half of your AVONEX sales force paid for  in this partnership?
Burt Adelman, Biogen Idec  EVP of Development [104]
(laughter) well, there is an angle we have not thought of 
William Rastetter, Biogen Idec  Chairman [105]
(laughter) You know, I think we're in the process of really deciding what kind of personal selling efforts should go behind ANTEGREN. And obviously, we need to optimize AVONEX sales as well. So, we've charged the marketing teams with actually studying and coming back with a number of options, including separate sales force's  including doubling the sales force. So, we are in the planning stages there. I think the
 
important thing is that exciting new compound, great market opportunity, new mechanism of action. And, we want to do everything we can to make sure that this product comes out of the gate very, very strong. We don't want to get in our own way by underfunding the launch. And certainly, we will be working very closely with Elan on  coming to the conclusion as to what is the right level of support for this product. This important product launch.
Jim Mullen, Biogen Idec  Presdient, CEO [106]
Let me just add a couple of comments. This is Jim Mullen. Clearly, we're going to make use of this infrastructure that we have in place. This is the team that built our MS franchise. This is the team that knows these positions  this is the team that has defended it so well. With Pfizer and Serano in the last two years now. So, you know, we are going to obviously  there's a lot of value there and that is of course one of the attractions of this thing. We're going to have to work through the exact details of how we re-shape that team to accommodate AVONEX and ANTEGREN. But clearly, we're not going to be laying off our AVONEX costs onto our partner, Elan. But, we do expect we are going to get leverage from the infrastructure we have. So, I think that it's probably going to take us three or six months to really worked through it. And it will be hard to explain it to anybody anyway, in the absence of people being able to look at the clinical data. Which is  I don't expect to be available to the public anytime soon.
Jason Kantor, WR Hambrecht  Analyst [107]

Caroline Loewy, Morgan Stanley.
Caroline Loewy,: Thank you, and not to beat a dead horse, but just a couple of quick follow-ups. On the AVONEX manufacturing, can you quantify what the cost of it looks like? Maybe 20 plus million and whether that is likely to spill over into the first quarter?
Peter Kellogg, Biogen Idec  CFO, EVP of Finance [109]
I'm sorry (multiple speakers)
Caroline Loewy, Morgan Stanley  Analyst [110]
The write-off costs for the additional manufacturing cost for AVONEX?
 
Peter Kellogg, Biogen Idec  CFO, EVP of Finance [111]
No, at this point we've captured what we've written off  honestly, in any manufacturing environment you have specifications. You produce within those specifications or not and then it's announced in the specifications to go through review process. But, at this point, we have written off everything that has been termed to be unusable, relative those reviews. So, that is the process now. I guess what you are asking is speculating, going forward, how much write-offs might we have, going forward. That is really hard to speculate on at this point.
Caroline Loewy, Morgan Stanley  Analyst [112]
I guess, now that we are in March, and there are two months of the quarter whether  either fixing the problem or the continued stopping/starting manufacturing  whatever you're doing. Whether that's incurring cost (indiscernible) both companies were running somewhere around 15 percent-ish sort of cost numbers, historically. You're stepping up to like 23 percent with the write-off  but that's a huge difference  and trying to get an idea where we're going to be relative to those 
Peter Kellogg, Biogen Idec  CFO, EVP of Finance [113]
Well, we don't know. Because at this point anything that is determined as unusual has been written-off. So, I think we're trying to sell the process. I think  I'm not sure  I'm not sure I understand your question (multiple speakers)
Burt Adelman, Biogen Idec  EVP of Development [114]
We don't have any more loss.
Caroline Loewy,: Whether the problems with operations  is you are trying to fix the problem during Q1, whether that is increasing your cost structure above the 15 percent sort of run rate that we've been seeing historically?
Peter Kellogg, Biogen Idec  CFO, EVP of Finance [115]
I see, okay. Let me just comment on that briefly. I apologize. I didn't really understand the question, initially. So, in fact, when you look at our P&L on these table 4 and table 3  one is for the quarter and one is for the full year, you will note that actually, for 03, that for the full year, our costs of sales was about 12 percent on the combined pro forma basis. In Q4, as you will note, it was up around 15 percent because of the magnitude of the
 
write-off that we took. And I mentioned that it was about $28 million. (multiple speakers) It was to products. It was first ZEVALIN which was actually more of a dating issue. That was not anything like that. There was a little bit of AMEVIVE write-off in there  very small. And then AVONEX as well (multiple speakers)
Caroline Loewy, Morgan Stanley  Analyst [116]
And that is on the full-year basis?
Peter Kellogg, Biogen Idec  CFO, EVP of Finance [117]
That is in the full year number but for full-year, that incorporates obviously the first three quarters. So, it is hard to comment on something kind of like that and try to speculate as to what that might be, going forward. But, once we get past this issue and get back to an operating mode, we expect our cost of sales to fall back down to the very low teen range. So, we hopefully are not going to be writing-off these kinds of inventories on an ongoing basis. I wouldn't provide guidance if that's going to be the ongoing situation. But, I think we just wanted to alert everybody that you've seen us write-off a healthy amount of inventory in Q4. Just wanted to alert you that that is a challenge that we're working with right now. But, I really couldn't speculate or give guidance. There's nothing going on right now in queue  the first couple of months of Q1 that would give me and ability to speculate going forward.

Okay. Thank you.
Elizabeth Woo, Biogen Idec  Senior Director of Investor Relations [119]
Operator, were going to take one or two more questions.

Matt Geller, CIBC World Markets  Analyst [121]
In doing marketing studies and understanding how ANTEGREN will fill a role, can you tell us a little bit about how you see the product, in terms of being used as ANTEGREN, versus AVONEX, versus combination? What factors do you think will be really
 
important from what you have learned now, in terms of the safety, in terms of efficacy, in terms of convenience of usage, and in terms of costs?
Burt Adelman, Biogen Idec  EVP of Development [122]
This is Burt. I don't that think we have the answers to all of those questions yet. We are in the midst of looking at the data. We don't have the two-year data, which, obviously, will further expand our understanding of the drug, particularly, vis-a-vis disability. But, you know, I would say that, as I said earlier in the conversation, first and foremost, we know that there is a significant population of patient's out there falling out of existing therapies because of either they don't want to give themselves an ejection, they cannot tolerate the adverse events associated with the existing therapies (technical difficulty)  and/or they prefer the convenience of going to a doctor once a month to get an injection. So, I think, that is a group right there. Clearly, you know, we know there are patients who breakthrough. We know that there are patients who have some degree of disease activity  either as measured by relapse rate and/or MRI, while they are on any of the current therapies. And, that is why the clinical development program for this product includes not only a placebo-controlled trial, you know, as a stand-alone therapy, but includes a study where we look at the efficacy of ANTEGREN when added to patients already on interferon, who still have some evidence of disease activity. So, I think it is going to be broadly applicable to the entire population of patients with MS who are or are not on therapy, who still have evidence of disease activity. And that was our idea when we ran this program, since we knew that a successful drug had to be effective in more than just naive patients.

Adam Walsh, Jefferies & Company.
Adam Walsh, Jeffries & Company  Analyst [124]
Thanks for taking my question. I have a two-parter for Burt. Can you walk us through your thought process on potentially requesting party review for ANTEGREN for MS  how you think about that? And the second part is, given that the two-year data from the Affirm and the Sentinel trials will be mature by the first part of 05, which could potentially overlap with the FDA review process for teh one-year data, can you give us some color on the FDA's position on seeing the two-year data prior to rendering a decision on approval? Thank you.
Burt Adelman, Biogen Idec  EVP of Development [125]
 
Okay, I will say, with respect to an accelerated approval, I'll ask them please  pretty please, will you consider it? And, of course we will ask for and make a compelling argument for a rapid review. Where we to be successful in getting a rapid review, then it would be done before, you know, the two-year data, and those data would be submitted as a label update. You know, I cannot speculate on any of the scenarios in-between. Although, I think that, generally, our intention and our understanding here is that they are prepared to review the data from one year, for these two trials. And they are not going to review those data and then sit around and wait to get the rest of the data to make a decision. There is no value to the agency to except one-year data for preliminary review, if really what they only want are the two-year data. So, I can tell you with confidence, that they will not be waiting  they will not be dragging their legs in the approval process, ultimately waiting to get the two-year data.
Adam Walsh, Jeffries & Company  Analyst [126]
Very helpful. Thank you.
Elizabeth Woo, Biogen Idec  Senior Director of Investor Relations [127]
Well, thank you for joining us on the call today. Christina, Dillon, and myself will be back at our desks in about 15 minutes, if you have follow-up questions. And we look forward to seeing you on our next earnings call in April.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Cambridge, MA (April 30, 2004)  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB), a global biotechnology leader with top products and capabilities in oncology and immunology, announced today first quarter 2004 earnings per share of $0.40 and net income of $143 million, both on an adjusted non-GAAP basis.
Adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share and net income for the first quarter of 2004 excludes merger-related accounting impacts, such as amortization of intangibles, inventory step up, and other merger-related charges, and all other non-operating charges. Adjusted pro forma non-GAAP earnings per share and net income for the first quarter of 2003 include revenue and expenses from the former Biogen, Inc. from January 1 to March 31, 2003 but excludes all other non-operating charges of former Biogen, Inc. and IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation. These adjustments, expenses, and non-operating charges are itemized on the attached reconciliation tables.
On a reported basis, calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Biogen Idec reported a loss of $41 million (or loss per share of $0.12) in the first quarter of 2004. The first quarter loss was primarily due to $275 million of certain non-cash merger-related accounting impacts.
 
Page 2 Biogen Idec Reports First Quarter 2004 Earnings
Biogen Idec's revenues for the first quarter of 2004 rose 24% to $542 million versus adjusted pro forma revenues of $437 million in the first quarter of 2003.
"We've had an excellent start to the year  both revenue and earnings results are up strongly. The U.S. filing of ANTEGREN by mid-year is on track. Our recent good news on ANTEGREN's accelerated timeline highlights one of the strategic benefits of the merger. With access to two large scale manufacturing facilities on both coasts, the Company is well-positioned to fulfill ANTEGREN's blockbuster potential," said James Mullen, Biogen Idec's Chief Executive Officer.
William Rastetter, Biogen Idec's Executive Chairman, said, " With three products in Phase III development  ANTEGREN in MS and Crohn's disease, BG-12 for psoriasis in Europe, and RITUXAN (rituximab) in rheumatoid arthritis  we have a robust pipeline that reaffirms our commitment to our corporate goal of averaging 15% revenue growth and 20% EPS growth through 2007."
Product Sales Performance
Revenues from AVONEX (Interferon beta-1a), Biogen Idec's therapy for patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), for the first quarter of 2004 increased 29% to $355 million from the first quarter of 2003. U.S. sales of AVONEX in the first quarter of 2004 were $240 million and international sales for AVONEX were $115 million.
AMEVIVE (alefacept), Biogen Idec's treatment for moderate to severe psoriasis, was approved at the end of January 2003. AMEVIVE sales were $13 million in the first quarter of 2004.
Revenues from ZEVALIN (ibritumomab tiuxetan), Biogen Idec's radioimmunotherapeutic agent, were $4.8 million in the first quarter as compared to $5.7 million for the same period last year.
Revenues for the first quarter of 2004 included $134 million from Biogen Idec's joint business arrangement with Genentech, Inc. related to RITUXAN, a treatment for certain B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas that the company co-promotes in the U.S. with Genentech, compared to $111 million for the first quarter of 2003. All U.S. sales of RITUXAN are recognized by Genentech, and Biogen Idec records its share of the pretax co-promotion profits on a quarterly basis. U.S. net sales of RITUXAN in the first quarter of 2004, as recorded by Genentech, were $362 million compared to $310 million in first quarter of 2003.

Safe Harbor
This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding expected future financial results and plans for our development programs, including ANTEGREN.
These statements are based on the Company's current beliefs and expectations. A number of risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially. For example, financial results, including future growth may be affected by a number of factors, including any slowing of growth of the markets for AVONEX and RITUXAN, any change in market acceptance of these products in key markets worldwide, the extent to which the Company achieves market acceptance of its other products, the impact of reimbursement and pricing decisions related to the Company's products, the impact of competitive products on the Company's products, the magnitude of costs associated with launch of new products, the impact of litigation, any unanticipated increase in expenses, in-licensing and product opportunities, and any material issues, delays or failures related to the manufacturing or supply of the Company's products. For example, we have encountered certain problems in the manufacture of AVONEX. As a result, we have had to recall several batches and write down a number of batches. If these problems were to recur, we would likely have to incur additional charges and could potentially experience an interruption in the supply of AVONEX.
 
Page 4 Biogen Idec Reports First Quarter 2004 Earnings
Our long-term growth will also depend on the successful development and commercialization of new products such as ANTEGREN. Drug development involves a high degree of risk. For example, our plans to file applications for approval of ANTEGREN as a treatment for MS in the U.S. and EU and our expectations as to the potential of ANTEGREN could be negatively affected if unexpected concerns arise from additional data or analysis, if regulatory authorities require additional information or further studies, or if we were to encounter other unexpected hurdles.
For more detailed information on the risks and uncertainties associated with these forward looking statements and the Company's other activities see the periodic reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

Cambridge, MA, July 28, 2004  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB), the world's third largest biotech company with leading products and capabilities in oncology and immunology, today reported its second quarter 2004 results.
Second Quarter Highlights
 
Page 2 Biogen Idec Reports Second Quarter 2004 Earnings
"With the timeline of ANTEGREN accelerated by more than a year in MS, much of the energy of the organization is focused on preparing for launches in the U.S. and Europe. Together with our partner, Elan, we have made significant strides this quarter in the regulatory arena, as well as manufacturing and commercial preparation," said James Mullen, Biogen Idec's Chief Executive Officer. "We're also excited to pursue additional business development deals, such as the recent Vernalis collaboration, that leverage our development and commercial infrastructure."
Financial Performance
In the second quarter of 2004, revenues grew 20% to $539 million (adjusted pro forma Q2 2003: $447 million), with:
On an adjusted non-GAAP basis, Biogen Idec reported net income was up 20% to $122 million in the second quarter of 2004 (Q2 2003: $102 million). Adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share increased 16% to $0.34 for the second quarter of 2004 (Q2 2003: $0.29).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Cambridge, MA, October 27, 2004  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB), the world's third largest biotech company with leading products and capabilities in oncology and immunology, today reported its third quarter 2004 results.
Third Quarter Highlights
 
Page 2 Biogen Idec Reports Third Quarter 2004 Earnings
"Since we completed our merger transaction approximately one year ago, Biogen Idec has delivered on its promise," said James Mullen, Biogen Idec's Chief Executive Officer. "I applaud the organization for the smooth and rapid integration. We've hit our major financial goals, the pipeline has advanced both through in-house efforts and business development deals, and we are on the verge of launching our next product."
Financial Performance
On an adjusted non-GAAP basis, Biogen Idec reported net income was $132 million in the third quarter of 2004 (Q3 2003: $123 million). Adjusted non-GAAP EPS was $0.37 for the third quarter of 2004 (Q3 2003: $0.35).
Adjusted non-GAAP EPS and net income for the third quarter of 2004 excludes merger-related accounting impacts, such as amortization of intangibles, impairment of intangibles, inventory step up, and other merger-related charges, and other non-operating charges. Adjusted pro forma non-GAAP EPS and net income for the third quarter of 2003 include revenue and expenses from the former Biogen, Inc. from July 1 to September 30, 2003 but excludes other non-operating charges of the former Biogen, Inc. and IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation. These adjustments, expenses, and non-operating charges are itemized on the attached reconciliation tables.
On a reported basis, calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Biogen Idec reported net income of $37 million (or EPS of $0.10) in the third quarter of 2004. The difference between adjusted non-GAAP net income and EPS and GAAP net income and EPS in the third quarter was primarily due to $112 million of non-cash merger-related accounting impacts and $13 million write-down of certain investments.
Revenue Performance
Third quarter revenues of AVONEX, Biogen Idec's therapy for patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, increased 16% to $346 million (adjusted pro forma Q3 2003: $298 million).
 
Page 3 Biogen Idec Reports Third Quarter 2004 Earnings
U.S. sales were $224 million (adjusted pro forma Q3 2003: $204 million). International sales were $122 million (adjusted pro forma Q3 2003: $94 million); in local currency, sales grew 21%.
Revenues for the third quarter of 2004 included $160 million from Biogen Idec's joint business arrangement with Genentech, Inc. related to RITUXAN, a treatment for certain B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas that Biogen Idec co-promotes in the U.S. with Genentech (Q3 2003: $134 million). All U.S. sales of RITUXAN are recognized by Genentech, and Biogen Idec records its share of the pretax co-promotion profits on a quarterly basis. U.S. net sales of RITUXAN in the third quarter of 2004, as recorded by Genentech, were $393 million (Q3 2003: $354 million).
Revenues of ZEVALIN (ibritumomab tiuxetan), Biogen Idec's radioimmunotherapeutic agent, were $5 million in the third quarter of 2004 (Q3 2003: $4 million).
Revenues of AMEVIVE (alefacept), Biogen Idec's treatment for moderate-to-severe psoriasis, were $8 million in the third quarter of 2004 (Q3 2003: $12 million).
Royalties were $24 million in the third quarter (adjusted pro forma Q3 2003: $29 million).
Share Repurchase Program
Biogen Idec announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 20 million shares of its common stock. The repurchased stock will provide the Company with treasury shares for general corporate purposes, such as stock to be issued under employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The share buyback will be largely funded through operating cash flow and will be accretive to EPS.
William Rastetter, Biogen Idec's Executive Chairman, said, "This share repurchase plan underscores the belief of management and the Board of Directors that our common stock represents an attractive investment for the Company, based on our well-defined strategy and our prospects for future growth. Given our strong anticipated operating cash flow, we do not expect this program to restrict our strategic flexibility."
The Company currently has approximately 334 million shares of common stock outstanding.

Safe Harbor
This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding expected future financial results and plans for our development programs, including ANTEGREN.
These statements are based on the Company's current beliefs and expectations. A number of risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially. For example, financial results, including future operating cash flow and overall prospects
 
Page 5 Biogen Idec Reports Third Quarter 2004 Earnings
for growth, may be affected by a number of factors, including any slowing of growth of the markets for AVONEX and RITUXAN, any change in market acceptance of these products in key markets worldwide, the extent to which the Company achieves market acceptance of its other products, the impact of reimbursement and pricing decisions related to the Company's products, the impact of competitive products on the Company's products, any material decreases in sales by licensees of products on which the Company receives royalties, the impact of litigation, any unanticipated increase in expenses, in-licensing and product opportunities, increase in costs related to development and commercialization of new products, including ANTEGREN, and any material issues, delays or failures related to the manufacturing or supply of the Company's products
.
Our long-term growth will depend on the successful development and commercialization of new products such as ANTEGREN. Drug development involves a high degree of risk. For example, our plans to launch ANTEGREN as a treatment for MS could be negatively affected if unexpected concerns arise from additional data or analysis, if regulatory authorities require additional information or further studies, or if we were to encounter other unexpected hurdles.
For more detailed information on the risks and uncertainties associated with these forward looking statements and the Company's other activities see the periodic reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

Item 8.01 Other Events
     On November 23, 2004, the Registrant publicly disseminated a press release announcing the approval of TYSABRI (natalizumab), formerly referred to as ANTEGREN, as a treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses. The FDA granted accelerated approval for TYSABRI following priority review based on one-year data from two Phase III clinical studies, the AFFIRM monotherapy trial and the SENTINEL combination trial with AVONEX (Interferon beta-1a). The information contained in the press release is incorporated herein by reference and filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.

Exhibit 99.1
Biogen Idec (NASDAQ: BIIB) and Elan Corporation, plc (NYSE: ELN) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved TYSABRI (natalizumab), formerly referred to as ANTEGREN, as treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses. FDA granted Accelerated Approval for TYSABRI following Priority Review based on one-year data from two Phase III studies, the AFFIRM monotherapy trial and the SENTINEL add-on trial with AVONEX(Interferon beta-1a).
Cambridge, MA; San Diego, CA; Dublin, Ireland  November 23, 2004 
TYSABRI, the first humanized monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of MS, inhibits adhesion molecules on the surface of immune cells. Research suggests TYSABRI works by preventing immune cells from migrating from the bloodstream into the brain where they can cause inflammation and potentially damage nerve fibers and their insulation.
 
"TYSABRI is a powerful and innovative therapy that offers new hope for hundreds of thousands of people living with MS," said James C. Mullen, chief executive officer, Biogen Idec. "We believe TYSABRI will revolutionize the treatment of MS and become the leading choice for patients and physicians."
"TYSABRI is a significant breakthrough for patients with MS," said Kelly Martin, president and chief executive officer, Elan. "The approval of TYSABRI, with its unique mechanism of action and new level of efficacy, has the potential to make a genuine difference in the lives of patients and families who struggle with the debilitating effects of this disease."
Results of the AFFIRM Monotherapy Trial
AFFIRM is a two-year, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of 942 patients conducted in 99 sites worldwide, in which patients were randomized to receive either a fixed 300 mg IV infusion dose of TYSABRI (n=627) or placebo (n=315) every four weeks. TYSABRI reduced the rate of clinical relapses by 66 percent relative to placebo (p<0.001), the primary endpoint at one-year. The annualized relapse rate was 0.25 for TYSABRI-treated patients versus 0.74 for placebo-treated patients.
AFFIRM also met all one-year secondary endpoints, including MRI measures. In the TYSABRI-treated group, 60 percent of patients developed no new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions compared to 22 percent of placebo-treated patients (p<0.001). On the one-year MRI scan, 96 percent of TYSABRI-treated patients had no gadolinium enhancing lesions compared to 68 percent of placebo-treated patients (p<0.001). The proportion of patients who remained relapse free was 76 percent in the TYSABRI-treated group compared to 53 percent in the placebo-treated group (p<0.001).
Results of SENTINEL Add-on Study
Approval was also based on the results of another Phase III clinical trial, SENTINEL. SENTINEL is a two-year, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of 1,171 AVONEX-treated patients in 123 clinical trial sites worldwide.
In the SENTINEL trial, AVONEX-treated patients who continued to experience disease activity were randomized to add TYSABRI (n=589) or placebo (n=582) to their standard regimen.
 
SENTINEL achieved its one-year primary endpoint. The addition of TYSABRI to AVONEX resulted in a 54 percent reduction in the rate of clinical relapses over the effect of AVONEX alone (p<0.001). The annualized relapse rate was 0.36 for patients receiving TYSABRI when added to AVONEX versus 0.78 with AVONEX plus placebo.
SENTINEL also met all secondary endpoints, including MRI measures. In the group treated with TYSABRI plus AVONEX, 67 percent of patients developed no new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions compared to 40 percent in the AVONEX plus placebo group (p<0.001). On the one-year MRI scan, 96 percent of TYSABRI plus AVONEX-treated patients had no gadolinium-enhancing lesions compared to 76 percent of AVONEX plus placebo-treated patients (p<0.001). The proportion of patients who remained relapse-free was 67 percent in the TYSABRI plus AVONEX-treated group compared to 46 percent in the AVONEX plus placebo-treated group (p<0.001).
"I believe TYSABRI will be an important therapeutic advance for patients with relapsing MS," said Richard Rudick, MD, lead investigator of the SENTINEL trial and director, Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis, Cleveland Clinic Foundation. "Patients who have discontinued therapy, are newly diagnosed with MS, or have persistent active disease despite being on a current therapy will benefit from TYSABRI."
Safety
Common adverse events associated with TYSABRI include headache, fatigue, urinary tract infection, depression, lower respiratory tract infection, joint pain and abdominal discomfort. The rate of infection in both studies was approximately one per patient-year in both TYSABRI-treated patients and placebo-treated patients.
Serious infections occurred in 1.3 percent of placebo-treated patients and 2.1 percent of TYSABRI-treated patients. Serious infections included bacterial infections such as pneumonia and urinary tract infection, which responded appropriately to antibiotics. TYSABRI has been associated with hypersensitivity reactions, including serious systemic reactions, which occurred at an incidence of less than 1 percent of patients.
 
Immunogenicity
All biologics have the potential to induce patient antibodies. Analysis of the one-year Phase III MS trials indicate a low level of immunogenicity associated with TYSABRI. Patients were tested for antibodies every 12 weeks in the AFFIRM and SENTINEL trials. Antibodies were detected in approximately 10 percent of patients at least once during treatment, with 6 percent of patients remaining persistently positive. Persistently positive antibodies were associated with a substantial decrease in efficacy and an increase in certain infusion-related adverse events. Almost all patients who tested positive for antibodies did so within the first 12 weeks of treatment.
Two-year Results
AFFIRM and SENTINEL are two-year trials. Two-year results are anticipated beginning in the first half of 2005. Patients who complete these trials are eligible for enrollment in a long-term safety extension study.
"The MS community is pleased that the FDA approval of TYSABRI provides an additional treatment option for people with relapsing forms of MS. There are many people living with MS who may benefit from this different treatment approach," said Stephen C. Reingold, PhD, vice president for research, the National MS Society.
About TYSABRI
Biogen Idec and Elan are collaborating equally on the development of TYSABRI in MS, Crohn's disease (CD), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In September 2004, a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for CD was filed with the EMEA based on Phase III studies, and another Phase III induction trial for CD is ongoing. A Phase II trial is also underway to evaluate TYSABRI in RA. To date, more than 2,800 patients have received TYSABRI in clinical trials.
Information about TYSABRI, including prescribing information, and its comprehensive support services, will be available through a single toll-free number (1-800-456-2255), and via www.TYSABRI.com.

January 5, 2005
William H. Rastetter, Ph.D. Executive Chairman Biogen Idec Inc.
Dear Bill:
     This letter sets forth our agreement as to your use of a company-owned condominium in Cambridge, Massachusetts. You acknowledge that you have been using the condominium since January 2004 and that this agreement covers your use of the condominium since that time as well as future use. The primary reason that the condominium is being provided to you is for lodging when you come to Cambridge for business purposes.
     As the owner of the condominium, the company reserves the right to use the condominium for company functions and other activities at the company's discretion and at times when such use does not interfere with your business visits to Cambridge.
     The condominium is to be used by you primarily for business purposes, i.e., lodging when you are away from your principal place of business in San Diego, California and in Cambridge performing services for the company. Limited incidental personal use of the condominium by you or by your spouse (or significant other), when accompanied by you, is permitted. You must report such personal use to the company within 30 days. The fair rental value of such personal use of the condominium will be added to your compensation, grossed up for the appropriate taxes, treated as wages for payroll tax purposes, and reported on Form W-2.
     As owner, the company will pay the costs and expenses of the condominium including taxes, condominium fees, insurance for real and personal property, utilities, cleaning, maintenance, renovations, repairs, and such other costs and expenses as are assessed or expected by the condominium association from time to time. Since you will be the principal business lodger of the condominium, the company will provide you with a list of approved service providers to perform cleaning, maintenance, renovation and repair services at times convenient to your visits. The approved service providers will bill the company directly for services related to the condominium. Costs and expenses of unapproved service providers will be your financial responsibility unless the company agrees to pay such costs and expenses. You agree to promptly provide the company with original invoices and bills, with appropriate explanations, for company-covered costs and expenses that are sent directly to the condominium.
 
     The company shall own the portion of the furniture, equipment, furnishings, decorations and similar items in the condominium for which it pays and you shall own the rest.
     You agree at all times to maintain the condominium in good, clean and livable condition, normal wear and tear excepted.
     Your use of the condominium is solely at the discretion of the company. The company may terminate your use of the condominium at anytime upon 30 days written notice to you. In addition, if your employment with the company ends for any reason, your use of the condominium will terminate on your last day of employment with the company.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Cambridge, MA, February 7, 2005  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB), the world's third largest biotech company with leading products and capabilities in oncology and immunology, today reported its fourth quarter and full year 2004 results.
Fourth Quarter & Full Year Highlights
 
Page 2 Biogen Idec Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2004 Earnings
excluding merger-related accounting impacts and other non-operating charges, adjusted pro forma non-GAAP EPS were $0.34.
James Mullen, Biogen Idec's Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Biogen Idec had a momentous year in 2004, highlighted by the approval of TYSABRI based on one-year data. Our major R&D programs experienced their most productive year and strong performance in AVONEX and RITUXAN fueled revenue growth of 19% to $2.2 billion. This puts us on track to meet our long-term goals of achieving approximately 15% top and 20% bottom line operating performance."
Financial Performance
On an adjusted non-GAAP basis, Biogen Idec reported net income of $121 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 (Q4 2003 adjusted pro forma non-GAAP: $91 million) and $518 million for the full year 2004 (2003 adjusted pro forma non-GAAP: $432 million). Adjusted non-GAAP EPS was $0.34 for the fourth quarter of 2004 (Q4 2003 adjusted pro forma non-GAAP: $0.25) and $1.44 for the full year 2004 (2003 adjusted pro forma non-GAAP: $1.22).
These adjustments are itemized on the attached reconciliation tables. Adjusted non-GAAP EPS and net income for the fourth quarter and full year of 2004 exclude merger-related accounting impacts, such as amortization of intangibles, impairment of intangibles, inventory step up, and other merger-related charges, and other non-operating charges. Adjusted pro forma non-GAAP EPS and net income for the fourth quarter and full year of 2003 include revenue and expenses from the former Biogen, Inc. from January 1 to November 12, 2003 (date of merger) but excludes similar merger-related accounting impacts excluded from fourth quarter and full year 2004 adjusted non-GAAP EPS and other non-operating charges of the former Biogen, Inc. and IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation.
On a reported basis, calculated in accordance with GAAP, Biogen Idec reported net income of $48 million (or EPS of $0.14) in the fourth quarter of 2004 and net income of $45 million (or EPS of $0.13) for the full year 2004. The difference between adjusted non-GAAP net income and EPS and GAAP net income and EPS in the fourth quarter and full year were primarily due to non-cash merger-related accounting impacts of $88 million and $656 million, respectively. Full year 2004 was also impacted by a $13 million write-down of certain investments.
Revenue Performance
 
Page 3 Biogen Idec Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2004 Earnings
Revenues from AVONEX, Biogen Idec's therapy for patients with relapsing forms of MS, increased 19 % in the fourth quarter to $370 million (Q4 2003 adjusted pro forma non-GAAP: $310 million). Full year AVONEX sales increased 21 % to $1.42 billion (2003 adjusted pro forma non-GAAP: $1.17 billion). In 2004, U.S. sales were $922 million and international sales were $495 million.
Revenues from AMEVIVE(alefacept), Biogen Idec's treatment for moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis, were $10 million in the fourth quarter (Q4 2003 adjusted pro forma non-GAAP: $17 million) and $43 million for the full year (2003 adjusted pro forma non-GAAP: $40 million).
Revenues from ZEVALIN (ibritumomab tiuxetan), Biogen Idec's radioimmunotherapeutic agent for relapsed or refractory low-grade, follicular or transformed B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), were $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 (Q4 2003: $5 million) and $23 million for the full year (2003: $20 million).
Revenues from TYSABRI, Biogen Idec's therapy for patients with relapsing forms of MS, were $3 million in the fourth quarter.
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2004 and full year 2004 included $170 million (Q4 2003: $130 million) and $615 million (2003: $493 million), respectively, from Biogen Idec's joint business arrangement with Genentech, Inc. related to RITUXAN, a treatment for certain B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas that Biogen Idec co-promotes in the U.S. with Genentech. All U.S. sales of RITUXAN are recognized by Genentech, and Biogen Idec records its share of the pretax co-promotion profits on a quarterly basis. U.S. net sales of RITUXAN were $429 million in the fourth quarter (Q4 2003: $369 million) and $1.57 billion for the full year (2003: $1.36 billion), as reported by Genentech.
Royalties were $25 million in the fourth quarter (Q4 2003 adjusted pro forma non-GAAP: $27 million) and $98 million for the full year (2003 adjusted pro forma non-GAAP: $127 million).
Financial Guidance
Biogen Idec today reaffirmed its long-term goal of achieving 15% compound annual revenue growth, and approximately 20% compound annual earnings per share (adjusted pro forma non-GAAP) growth through 2007.
Given the launch investments behind TYSABRI, the Company is anticipating low double-digit growth for revenue and adjusted non-GAAP earnings in 2005. On this non-GAAP basis, the Company expects operating expenses to grow 1214% over 2004 levels and its effective tax rate for 2005 to be in the range of 3133%. As a result, the Company estimates that its 2005 non-GAAP earnings per share will be in the range of $1.60 to the low $1.70's.
The Company anticipates that 2005 capital expenditures will be in the range of $400  $475 million. A significant portion of these expenditures will be directed towards the

completion of the Oceanside manufacturing facility and the construction of a large-scale manufacturing facility in Denmark.

Safe Harbor
This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding expected future financial results and plans for our development programs, including TYSABRI.
These statements are based on the Company's current beliefs and expectations. A number of risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially. For example, financial results, including future revenue and EPS growth, anticipated levels of expenses, other statements regarding future financial performance, and overall prospects for the Company's products may be affected by a number of factors, including the degree and timing of market acceptance of TYSABRI, any unexpected slowing of growth of the markets for AVONEX and RITUXAN, any change in market acceptance of these products in key markets worldwide, the impact of reimbursement and pricing decisions related to the Company's products, particularly TYSABRI, the impact of competitive products on the Company's products, any material decreases in sales by licensees of products on which the Company receives royalties, the impact of litigation, the impact of costs related to the launch of TYSABRI, any unanticipated increase in expenses related to in-licensing and product opportunities, increases in costs related to development of new products and existing products in new indications, and any material issues, delays or failures related to the manufacturing or supply of the Company's products
.
Drug development and commercialization involve a high degree of risk. For example, our development and commercialization of TYSABRI as a treatment for MS could be negatively affected if unexpected concerns arise from additional data, including the two-year data from the Phase 3 trial, once unblinded, or if we were to encounter other unexpected hurdles.
For more detailed information on the risks and uncertainties associated with these forward looking statements and the Company's other activities see the periodic reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
 
 
TABLE 2
 
The non-GAAP financial measures presented below are utilized by Biogen Idec management to gain an understanding of the comparative financial performance of the Company. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they exclude those non-operational activities or transactions that are not necessarily relevant to understanding the trends of the Company or the prospects of future performance. The presentation of this information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Numbers may not foot due to rounding.
Adjustments were made to conform prior periods to current year presentation including adoption of EITF 03-06, which requires allocation of income to certain holders of equity and debt instruments and the immaterial correction of a non-GAAP elimination of intercompany activities between legacy pre-merger companies.
 
The non-GAAP pro forma financial measures presented below are utilized by Biogen Idec management to gain an understanding of the comparative revenue performance of the Company. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they include those non-GAAP activities or transactions that may be relevant to obtaining an understanding of the trends of the Company or the prospects of future performance.
(a) Represents former Biogen, Inc. revenue that is not included in GAAP revenues.

Item 8.01 Other Events
     On February 17, 2005, the Registrant publicly disseminated a press release announcing that the Phase 3 TYSABRI (natalizumab) AFFIRM monotherapy study achieved the two-year primary endpoint of slowing the progression of disability in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis and that the rate of clinical relapses, the study's primary endpoint at one-year, was sustained over two years and consistent with previously reported one-year results. The information contained in the press release is incorporated herein by reference and filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.

Exhibit 99.1
For More Information Contact:
Biogen Idec (NASDAQ: BIIB) and Elan Corporation, plc (NYSE: ELN) announced today that the Phase III TYSABRI (natalizumab) AFFIRM monotherapy trial achieved the two-year primary endpoint of slowing the progression of disability in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). TYSABRI treatment led to a 42 percent reduction in the risk of disability progression relative to placebo. These data also demonstrated a 67 percent reduction in the rate of clinical relapses over two years, which was sustained and consistent with the previously reported one-year results.
Cambridge, MA and Dublin, Ireland  February 17, 2005 
Other data from AFFIRM at two years, including MRI measures and immunogenicity were similar to previously reported results.
The adverse event profile at two years was also consistent with previously reported results. Common events included headache, fatigue, urinary tract infection, depression,
 
Page 2 TYSABRI
Two-Year Monotherapy Trial Demonstrates Significant Impact
lower respiratory tract infection, limb and joint pain, and pharyngitis. The incidence of infections in TYSABRI-treated and placebo-treated patients was similar. Serious infections occurred in 3.2 percent and 2.6 percent of patients, respectively. These included bacterial infections such as pneumonia and urinary tract infection, which responded appropriately to antibiotics. TYSABRI has also been associated with hypersensitivity reactions, including serious systemic reactions that occurred at an incidence of less than 1 percent of patients.
"TYSABRI, with its significant effect on slowing the progression of disability, offers new hope for patients with MS," said Burt Adelman, MD, executive vice president, Development, Biogen Idec. "With these data, we gain a more complete understanding of the broad therapeutic benefit of TYSABRI in MS."
"Results from the two-year monotherapy clinical trial mark a major milestone in the treatment of MS. These two-year data strengthen our belief that TYSABRI will become the leading therapy for MS patients," said Lars Ekman, MD, executive vice president and president, Research and Development, Elan.
AFFIRM is a two-year, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of 942 patients conducted in 99 sites worldwide, evaluating the effect of TYSABRI on the progression of disability as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and the rate of clinical relapses. Patients were randomized to receive either a 300 mg IV infusion dose of TYSABRI (n=627) or placebo (n=315) every four weeks.
Based on one-year data from AFFIRM and the SENTINEL add-on trial with AVONEX (Interferon beta-1a), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Accelerated Approval for TYSABRI on November 23, 2004, as a treatment for relapsing forms of MS.
The companies anticipate that two-year data from the AFFIRM trial will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) meeting in April 2005. The companies expect two-year results from the SENTINEL trial will be available mid-year. Two-year data from both studies will also be submitted to regulatory authorities.
TYSABRI, the first humanized monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of MS, inhibits adhesion molecules on the surface of immune cells. Research suggests TYSABRI works by preventing immune cells from migrating from the bloodstream into the brain where they can cause inflammation and potentially damage nerve fibers and their insulation.
About TYSABRI
Biogen Idec and Elan are collaborating equally on the development of TYSABRI in MS, Crohn's disease (CD), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Regulatory authorities in Canada and Australia have designated TYSABRI for Priority Review as a treatment for MS, and the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) is actively reviewing the application.
 
Page 3 TYSABRI
Two-Year Monotherapy Trial Demonstrates Significant Impact
In September 2004, the companies submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the EMEA for CD based on Phase III studies. Another Phase III induction trial for CD is ongoing. A Phase II trial is also underway to evaluate TYSABRI in RA. To date, more than 3,200 patients have received TYSABRI in clinical trials.
Information about TYSABRI, including U.S. prescribing information, and its comprehensive support services in the U.S., is available through a single toll-free number (1-800-456-2255), and via

EXHIBIT 99.1
Biogen Idec (NASDAQ: BIIB) and Elan Corporation, plc (NYSE: ELN) announced today a voluntary suspension in the marketing of TYSABRI (natalizumab), a treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS). The companies are suspending supply of TYSABRI from commercial distribution and physicians should suspend dosing of TYSABRI until further notification. In addition, the companies have suspended dosing in all clinical trials.
Cambridge, MA and Dublin, Ireland  February 28, 2005 
This decision is based on very recent reports of two serious adverse events that have occurred in patients treated with TYSABRI in combination with AVONEX (Interferon beta-1a) in clinical trials. These events involve one fatal, confirmed case and one suspected case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare and frequently fatal, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Both patients received more than two years of TYSABRI therapy in combination with AVONEX.
The companies' actions have been taken in consultation with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Worldwide regulatory agencies are being kept informed.
The companies will work with clinical investigators to evaluate TYSABRI-treated patients and will consult with leading experts to better understand the possible risk of PML. The outcome of these evaluations will be used to determine possible re-initiation of dosing in clinical trials and future commercial availability.
 
Page 2 Biogen Idec and Elan Announce Voluntary Suspension of TYSABRI
"Our ongoing commitment to MS patients has led us to take these steps," said Burt Adelman, MD, executive vice president, Development, Biogen Idec. "Because we believe in the promising therapeutic benefit of TYSABRI, we are working to evaluate this situation thoroughly and expeditiously. While we work through this matter, we must place patient safety above all other considerations."
"We are working with leading experts and regulatory agencies to responsibly investigate these events and to develop the appropriate path forward," said Lars Ekman, MD, executive vice president and president, Research and Development, Elan. "Our primary concern is for the safety of patients."
In total, approximately 3,000 patients have been treated with TYSABRI in clinical trials of MS, Crohn's disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. To date, the companies have received no reports of PML in MS patients receiving TYSABRI monotherapy or in patients with Crohn's disease or rheumatoid arthritis in TYSABRI clinical trials. Biogen Idec has received no reports of PML in patients treated with AVONEX alone, a product that has been on the market since 1996.
A copy of the Dear Healthcare Professional Letter regarding this matter is available at and the companies' corporate websites. Patients and physicians with questions should call 1-888-489-7227.

ITEM 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
      Biogen Idec Inc., or the Company, previously announced its unaudited fourth quarter and full year 2004 results in a press release issued on February 7, 2005 (furnished as Exhibit 99.1 of the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K furnished on February 7, 2005). These results were announced prior to, and do not take into account the impact of, the voluntary suspension by the Company and Elan Corporation, plc, in consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, of marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI (natalizumab), a treatment for multiple sclerosis, which suspension was announced in a press release issued on February 28, 2005. Since the February 28, 2005 announcement, the Company has been diligently assessing the impact of the suspension of TYSABRI, a subsequent event for purposes of its 2004 financial statements, and related matters on the Company's 2004 financial statements, including reviewing certain of the Company's assets for possible impairment as of December 31, 2004. The Company today filed a Form 12b-25 extending the deadline for filing its Form 10-K for 15 days in order to complete this assessment and the Form 10-K. The Company expects that its audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 included in its Form 10-K will reflect adjustments to the full year 2004 results previously announced on February 7, 2005 which are primarily related to the TYSABRI suspension and related matters as well as additional information. The Company's assessment of the impact of the TYSABRI suspension and related matters on its 2004 financial statement has not been completed as of the date of this filing; however, the Company expects that the principal effect of these adjustments will be to decrease the Company's 2004 Income Before Income Taxes from the amounts previously announced on February 7, 2005 by no more than $15 million, resulting in Income Before Income Taxes for 2004 of not less than $78 million. The Company is proceeding expeditiously to complete its assessment and expects to file its Form 10-K within the 15-day extension period.
 
      Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

ITEM 8.01 Other Events.
     On March 2, 2005, Biogen Idec Inc., or the Company, William H. Rastetter, the Company's Executive Chairman, and James C. Mullen, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, were named as defendants in a purported class action lawsuit, captioned , filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The action is purportedly brought on behalf of all purchasers of the Company's publicly-traded securities between February 18, 2004 and February 25, 2005. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding potentially serious side effects of TYSABRI (natalizumab) in order to gain accelerated approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for the product's distribution and sale. The plaintiff alleges that these materially false and misleading statements harmed the purported class by artificially inflating the price of the Company's stock during the purported class period and that Company insiders benefited personally from the inflated price by selling Company stock. The plaintiff seeks unspecified damages, as well as interest, cost and attorneys' fees. A substantially similar action, captioned , was filed on March 10, 2005 in the same court by another purported class representative. The Company believes that the actions are without merit and intends to contest them vigorously.
Brown v. Biogen Idec Inc., et al.
Grill v. Biogen Idec Inc., et al.
     On March 4, 2005, a purported shareholder derivative action, captioned was filed in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware, in New Castle County, on behalf of the Company, against the Company as nominal defendant, the Company's Board of Directors and the Company's former general counsel. The plaintiff derivatively claims breaches of fiduciary duty by the Board of Directors for inadequate oversight of the Company's policies, practices, controls and assets, and for recklessly awarding executive bonuses despite alleged awareness of potentially serious side effects of TYSABRI and the potential for related harm to the Company's financial position. The plaintiff also derivatively claims that the Company's Executive Chairman, its former general counsel and a director misappropriated confidential Company information for personal profit by selling Company stock while in possession of material, non-public information regarding the potentially serious side effects of TYSABRI, and alleges that the Board of Directors did not ensure that appropriate policies were in place regarding the control of confidential information and personal trading in Company securities by officers and directors. The plaintiff seeks unspecified damages, profits, the return of all bonuses paid by the Company, costs and attorneys' fees. A substantially similar action, captioned was filed on March 14, 2005 in the same court. Neither of the plaintiffs made presuit demand on the Board of Directors prior to filing their respective actions. As required by applicable law, the Company and the Board of Directors are considering the derivative claims in the complaints and will respond in a time and manner consistent with applicable Delaware statutory and common law.
Halpern v. Rastetter, et al.,
Golaine v. Rastetter, et al.,
     On March 9, 2005, two additional purported shareholder derivative actions, captioned and were brought in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Diego, on behalf of the Company, against the Company as nominal defendant, the Company's Board of Directors and the Company's chief financial officer.
Carmona v. Mullen, et al.
Fink v. Mullen, et al.,
Table of Contents
The plaintiffs derivatively claim breach of fiduciary duties, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment against all defendants. The plaintiffs also derivatively claim insider selling in violation of California Corporations Code  25402 and breach of fiduciary duty and misappropriation of information against certain defendants who sold Company securities during the period of February 18, 2004 to the date of the complaints. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants caused and/or allowed the Company to issue, and conspired, aided and abetted and acted in concert in concealing that the Company was issuing, false and misleading press releases about the safety of TYSABRI and its financial prospects which resulted in legal claims being asserted against the Company, irreparable harm to the Company's corporate image, depression of the Company's stock price and impairment of the Company's ability to raise capital. The plaintiffs also allege that certain defendants sold personally owned shares of Company stock while in possession of material, undisclosed, adverse information. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages, treble damages for the purported insider trading in violation of California Corporate Code  25402, equitable relief including restriction of the defendants' trading proceeds or other assets, restitution, disgorgement and costs, including attorneys' fees and expenses. Neither of the plaintiffs made presuit demand on the Board of Directors prior to filing their respective actions. As required by applicable law, the Company and the Board of Directors are considering the derivative claims in the complaints and will respond in a time and manner consistent with applicable statutory and common law.
The Company's Board of Directors has received letters, dated March 1 and 15, 2005, respectively, on behalf of purported owners of the Company's securities purportedly constituting demands under Delaware law. A supplement to the March 1 letter was received on March 2, 2005. The letters generally allege that certain officers and directors of the Company breached their fiduciary duty to the Company by selling personally held shares of Company securities while in possession of material, non-public information about potential serious side effects of TYSABRI. The letters generally request that the Company's Board of Directors take action on behalf of the Company to recover compensation and profits from the officers and directors, consider enhanced corporate governance controls related to the sales of securities by Company insiders, and pursue other such equitable relief, damages, and other remedies as may be appropriate. As required by applicable law, the Board of Directors is currently considering the letters and will respond in a time and manner consistent with Delaware law.

 Elan Corporation, plc (NYSE: ELN) and Biogen Idec (NASDAQ: BIIB) announced today that their ongoing safety evaluation of TYSABRI (natalizumab) has led to a previously diagnosed case of malignant astrocytoma being reassessed as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), in a patient in an open label Crohn's disease clinical trial.
Dublin, Ireland and Cambridge, MA  March 30, 2005
In light of the two previously reported cases of PML in multiple sclerosis clinical trials, Elan and Biogen Idec initiated an additional comprehensive safety evaluation of TYSABRI clinical trial patients. In the course of this safety review, the companies identified a case warranting reassessment in an open label Crohn's disease clinical trial. In July 2003, the case was reported by a clinical trial investigator as malignant astrocytoma. This diagnosis was confirmed at the time by histopathology. The patient died in December 2003.
As part of this ongoing safety review, the companies, in agreement with the clinical trial investigator, reassessed the case. Following this additional evaluation, the diagnosis is being reassessed as PML. The patient had received 8 doses of TYSABRI over an 18 month period and prior medication history included multiple courses of immunosuppressant agents.
 
Page 2 Elan and Biogen Idec Announce Tysabri Update
Elan and Biogen Idec's comprehensive safety evaluation concerning TYSABRI and any possible link to PML is ongoing. The companies are reviewing clinical trial data, working with investigators to evaluate the approximately 3,000 patients in multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, and rheumatoid arthritis trials, and working with PML and neurology experts. The results of this safety evaluation will be discussed with regulatory agencies to determine possible re-initiation of dosing in clinical trials and future commercial availability.
On February 28, 2005, the companies announced that they had suspended marketing of TYSABRI in multiple sclerosis and dosing in all clinical trials based on two previously reported cases of PML, a rare and frequently fatal, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system.

On a reported basis, calculated in accordance with GAAP, Biogen Idec reported net income of $43 million (or EPS of $0.12) in the first quarter of 2005 (Q1 2004: net loss of $41 million, or loss per share of $0.12). The difference between adjusted non-GAAP net income and EPS and GAAP net income and EPS in the first quarter were primarily due to pre-tax charges of $86 million of non-cash merger-related accounting impacts, primarily amortization of intangibles, inventory step-up, and other merger-related charges. These adjustments are itemized on the attached reconciliation tables.
Revenue Performance
Revenues for the first quarter of 2005 were up 20% to $160 million (Q1 2004: $134 million) from Biogen Idec's joint business arrangement with Genentech related to RITUXAN, a treatment for certain B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas that Biogen Idec co-promotes in the U.S. with Genentech. All U.S. sales of RITUXAN are recognized by Genentech, and Biogen Idec records its share of the pretax co-promotion profits on a quarterly basis. U.S. net sales of RITUXAN were $441 million in the first quarter of 2005 (Q1 2004: $362 million), as reported by Genentech.
Revenues from AVONEX, Biogen Idec's therapy for patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), increased 5% in the first quarter to $374 million (Q1 2004: $355 million). In the first quarter of 2005, U.S. sales were $233 million and international sales were $141 million.
Revenues from TYSABRI, a therapy for patients with relapsing forms of MS that Biogen Idec co-developed with Elan Corporation, plc, were $6 million in the first quarter, net of estimated returns associated with the voluntary suspension of the marketing of this product.
Revenues from other products were $18 million in the first quarter (Q1 2004: $18 million). Specifics are provided in Table 4.
Royalties were $27 million in the first quarter of 2005 (Q1 2004: $25 million).

Safe Harbor
This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding expected future financial results, plans for our development programs and the potential for TYSABRI.
These statements are based on the Company's current beliefs and expectations. A number of risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially. For example, financial results, including future revenue and EPS growth, anticipated levels of expenses, other statements regarding future financial performance, and overall prospects for the Company's products may be affected by a number of factors, including any unexpected slowing of growth of the markets for AVONEX and RITUXAN, any change in market acceptance of AVONEX and RITUXAN in key markets worldwide, the impact of reimbursement and pricing decisions related to the Company's products, the impact of competitive products on the Company's products, any material decreases in sales by licensees of products on which the Company receives royalties, the impact of litigation, the impact of costs related to the suspension of TYSABRI, any unanticipated increase in expenses related to in-licensing and product opportunities, increases in costs related to development of new products and existing products in new indications, and any material issues, delays or failures related to the manufacturing or supply of the Company's products.
Our long-term growth will depend on the successful development and commercialization of new products. Drug development involves a high degree of risk. For example, the plans for our development programs could be negatively affected if unexpected concerns arise from additional data or analysis, if regulatory authorities require additional information or further studies, or if we were to encounter other unexpected hurdles.
The potential for TYSABRI is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. There is no assurance, for example, that we will be able to gain sufficient information to fully understand the risks associated with the product. There is also no assurance that the Company and Elan will be able to resume marketing and sales of TYSABRI.
For more detailed information on the risks and uncertainties associated with these forward looking statements and the Company's other activities, see the periodic reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
 
 
 
The non-GAAP financial measures presented below are utilized by Biogen Idec management to gain an understanding of the comparative financial performance of the Company. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they exclude those non-operational activities or transactions that are not necessarily relevant to understanding the trends of the Company or the prospects of future performance. The presentation of this information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Numbers may not foot due to rounding.
Adjustments were made to conform prior periods to current year presentation including adoption of EITF 03-06, which requires allocation of income to certain holders of equity and debt instruments.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On June 16, 2005, Biogen Idec Inc., or the Company, and Genentech, Inc., or Genentech, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement and Joint Escrow Instructions, or the Agreement, pursuant to which the Company, among other things, agreed to sell the Company's large-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Oceanside, California, known as "NIMO," to Genentech. The consummation of the transaction is subject to various closing conditions. If the closing conditions are met, the parties anticipate that the closing of the sale will take place as early as June 23, 2005.
     Of the approximately 430 employees currently working at NIMO, approximately 330 are expected to be offered employment with Genentech and the rest are expected to remain employees of the Company.
Material Terms and Conditions of the Agreement
     The following is a brief description of the material terms and conditions of the Agreement.
     . Approximately 60 acres of real property located in Oceanside, California upon which NIMO is located, together with improvements, related property rights, and certain personal property intangibles and contracts at or related to the real property.
Property Being Sold by the Company/Purchased by Genentech
     . $408,130,000.00. A portion of the purchase price equal to the balance of certain payments owed by the Company to the general contractor retained by the Company to construct the improvements on the property will be deposited into an escrow account at closing to pay for the completion of certain work with respect to the improvements.
Purchase Price
     . The Company and Genentech intend that following the closing of the sale, the Company will terminate and, subject to provisions of applicable law, Genentech will offer employment, on an "at-will" basis, to approximately 330 of the Company's employees now working at NIMO. These employees will continue to be employed by the Company for a period of time after the closing and the Company will make these employees available to Genentech during this period in exchange for Genentech's agreement to reimburse the Company for related costs and expenses.
Employees
     . The Company and Genentech will enter into a transition services agreement pursuant to which they will provide certain services to each other relating to NIMO during the post-closing transition period.
Transition Services
Existing Relationship between the Company and Genentech
     The Company and Genentech collaborate on the development and commercialization of RITUXAN (rituximab). RITUXAN is currently marketed and sold worldwide for the treatment of certain B-cell non-Hodgkins' lymphoma. Under the original collaboration agreement, entered into in March 1995, the Company granted Genentech a worldwide license to develop, commercialize and market RITUXAN in multiple indications. In exchange for these worldwide rights, the Company has copromotion rights in the U.S. and a contractual arrangement under which Genentech shares a portion of the pretax U.S. copromotion profits of RITUXAN
Table of Contents
with the Company and pays license fees to the Company on sales of RITUXAN outside of the United States. In June 2003, the Company and Genentech amended and restated the original collaboration agreement to include the development and commercialization of one or more anti-CD20 antibodies targeting B-cell disorders, in addition to RITUXAN, for a broad range of indications. RITUXAN is the trade name in the U.S., Canada and Japan for the compound rituximab. MabThera is the tradename for rituximab in the European Union.
Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
     As described under Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement and Joint Escrow Instructions with Genentech, pursuant to which the Company, among other things, agreed to sell the Company's large-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Oceanside, California, known as "NIMO," to Genentech. The information contained in Item 1.01 is incorporated into this Item 2.05 by reference.
     The Company's decision to sell NIMO was made after careful review and analysis by the Company's management and Board of Directors. The Company previously had planned to use NIMO to manufacture TYSABRI (natalizumab) and other commercial products. The Company currently manufactures TYSABRI at its manufacturing facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, or RTP. If the Company is able to re-introduce TYSABRI to the market, the Company expects that it will be able to meet foreseeable manufacturing needs for TYSABRI from the RTP manufacturing facility. The Company completed construction of NIMO and obtained the certificate of occupancy for the facility in the fourth quarter of 2004, and had planned to continue commissioning and validation of the facility through 2005 to seek licensing of the facility for the manufacture of TYSABRI in 2006. These plans were affected by the Company's voluntarily suspension of the marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI and dosing of TYSABRI in clinical studies in February 2005. Accordingly, and after taking into account NIMO's estimated annual operating costs of approximately $80 to $100 million, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the sale of NIMO to Genentech on substantially the terms set forth in the Agreement.
     The Company expects to incur total charges in the range of approximately $80-90 million, before income tax, in connection with the transactions described above. These charges are expected to consist primarily of an approximately $70-78 million write down of NIMO to net selling price and approximately $10-12 million of sales and transfer taxes and other associated transaction costs. The Company expects that future cash expenditures resulting from the transactions described above will be approximately $10-12 million. On an after-tax basis, the total charges incurred in connection with the transactions described above are expected to be in the range of $50-57 million. The Company currently expects that all employees it terminates in connection with the sale will accept Genentech's offer of employment and that it will not incur any material charges associated with these terminations.
     This report contains forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, statements regarding the sale of NIMO and related assets, the impact of the sale on the employees at NIMO and their future employment, the operating costs of NIMO, the amount of charges and costs the Company expects to incur in connection with the transactions described above, and the ability to meet manufacturing requirements for TYSABRI. These statements are based on the
Table of Contents
Company's current beliefs and expectations as to future outcomes and are not guarantees of future performance. There are a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected, including but not limited to, unexpected expenditures, costs and charges related to the transactions described above, the inability of the Company or Genentech to satisfy all of the conditions to closing the sale, and the demand for TYSABRI if the Company is able to re-introduce it to the market. For more detailed information on the risks and uncertainties associated with the Company's business activities see the reports the Company files with the SEC from time to time, including the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2005. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements made in this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

- Biogen Idec (NASDAQ: BIIB) and Elan Corporation, plc (NYSE: ELN) announced today that findings from their safety evaluation of TYSABRI (natalizumab) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) resulted in no new confirmed cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The companies have previously reported three confirmed cases of PML, two of which were fatal. The ongoing safety evaluation in Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis is on track to be completed by the end of the summer. The companies anticipate making submissions to regulatory authorities in early fall of 2005. The companies are taking preliminary steps to restart clinical trials in MS.
Cambridge, MA and Dublin, Ireland  August 9, 2005
More than 2,000 MS patients from clinical trials were eligible for the safety evaluation. To date, 91% of these MS patients participated in the safety evaluation. The remaining 9% of patients did not participate in the safety review. A total of 99% of patients participating in the evaluation visited their treating physician and had a neurological exam. In addition, 98% of participants had an MRI exam. The safety evaluation also included the review of any reports of potential PML in patients receiving TYSABRI in the commercial setting.
"Our ongoing TYSABRI safety evaluation is a rigorous medical and scientific undertaking that has been led by some of the world's leading experts in neurology and neuroradiology," said Whaijen Soo, MD, PhD, senior vice president, Medical Research, Biogen Idec. "Given the high unmet medical need in MS and the therapeutic benefit we have seen with TYSABRI, we are encouraged by these safety findings."
 
Page 2 Biogen Idec and Elan Announce TYSABRI Safety Evaluation Update
"The findings announced today are an important milestone in understanding the appropriate benefit-risk profile for TYSABRI. Patient safety remains our top priority. We are committed to finalizing the safety evaluation for Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis, which is progressing well and on track to be completed by the end of the summer. We look forward to working with regulatory authorities to determine the path forward for TYSABRI," said Lars Ekman, MD, PhD, executive vice president and president, Research and Development, Elan.
On February 28, 2005, Biogen Idec and Elan announced that they voluntarily suspended TYSABRI from the U.S. market and all ongoing clinical trials based on reports of PML, a rare and potentially fatal, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Biogen Idec and Elan's comprehensive safety evaluation concerning TYSABRI and any possible link to PML is ongoing. The results of this safety evaluation will be discussed with regulatory agencies to determine the appropriate path forward for TYSABRI.
Biogen Idec and Elan will host a webcast for the media and investment community at 8:30 a.m. EST today to discuss the TYSABRI safety evaluation update. This webcast can be accessed through the investor relations' sections of the companies' websites.

Safe Harbor/ Forward Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding the potential, regulatory path forward, re-start of MS clinical trials and safety evaluation of TYSABRI. The potential, regulatory path forward and re-start of clinical trials for TYSABRI are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from the companies current expectations include the risk that concerns may arise from additional data or analysis, including the ongoing safety evaluation, or that the companies may encounter other unexpected delays or hurdles. There is also no assurance that the companies will be able to gain

Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On September 8, 2005, Biogen Idec Inc. (the "Company"), announced that Michael Gilman, the Company's Executive Vice President, Research, is leaving the Company, effective November 8, 2005. In connection with his departure, Dr. Gilman will receive severance and other benefits under the Company's Executive Severance Policy, as amended.
Item 2.05  Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
     On September 7, 2005, a special Committee of the Company's Board of Directors approved and adopted a comprehensive strategic plan aimed at positioning the Company for long-term growth (the "Plan"). The Plan has three principal elements:
     The Plan includes a reduction of the Company's workforce by 17%, or approximately 650 positions worldwide. The Company estimates that it will incur approximately $30 million to $40 million of costs in connection with the workforce reduction, almost all of which are costs related to severance and associated staff restructuring. The Company expects to record the majority of these costs as a pre-tax charge in the third quarter of 2005. The Company expects that the workforce reduction will be substantially implemented by the end of 2005 and that most of the costs will be paid out by the end of the second quarter of 2006.
     A copy of the Company's press release announcing the Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 (the "Press Release").
     This report contains forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, statements regarding the Plan, the impact of the Plan on the Company, the expenses the Company expects to incur in connection with the Plan, and the timing of the pre-tax charges the Company expects to take in connection with the Plan. These statements are based on the Company's current beliefs and expectations as to future outcomes and are not guarantees of future performance. There are a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected, including but not limited to, unexpected expenditures, costs and charges related to the Plan. For more detailed information on the risks and uncertainties associated with the Company's business activities, see the reports the Company files with the SEC from time to time, including the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2005.

INVESTOR CONTACTS:
 Biogen Idec (NASDAQ: BIIB) today announced a comprehensive strategic plan to position the company for long-term growth. The plan builds on the continuing strength of the core products and expected near-term developments. The plan has three principal elements:
Cambridge, MA and San Diego, CA, September 8, 2005
"In the second quarter, Biogen Idec reported a significant increase in earnings, driven in large part by the strong performance of our AVONEX(Interferon beta-1a) and RITUXAN (rituximab) products. While Biogen Idec is well poised for near-term success, we believe that to continue to deliver for patients, employees, and shareholders requires a bold reshaping of the company in an effort to generate high-level, sustainable growth beyond the

current decade," said James C. Mullen, Biogen Idec's President and Chief Executive Officer. "The first step in executing our new plan is to discontinue activities and programs that are unlikely to create significant value and reallocate our intellectual and financial resources to growth projects."
The strategic plan announced today will build on several expected near-term developments, including:
Enhanced Economic Flexibility
Reflecting a comprehensive review of its organizational structure, geographic site missions, asset base, staffing levels and business processes, Biogen Idec has taken and plans to take a series of actions aimed at reducing annual operating expenses by $200 million to $300 million.
Acceleration of Growth Through External Opportunities:
A key element of the strategic plan is to accelerate long-term growth through increased business development and research activities. Biogen Idec expects that the increased economic flexibility will permit it to earmark approximately $200 million a year for business development and external research opportunities starting in 2006. By comparison, the company had earmarked approximately $50 million for business development in 2005.
 
Page 3 Biogen Idec Announces Strategic Initiative
Biogen Idec will consider a range of business opportunities, including the in-licensing of, and formation of collaborations around, product opportunities and the acquisition of products and companies, as well as expanding collaborative research with academic institutions and teaching hospitals. Biogen Idec believes that these corporate initiatives will enable it to significantly expand the number of potential products in its pipeline in subsequent years.
Biogen Idec has cash and cash equivalents (short- and long-term) of approximately $1.8 billion.
Organizational and Cultural Transformation
Driving future growth through business development activities such as in-licensing, collaborations and acquisitions will require certain organizational and cultural changes. This includes:
About Biogen Idec

As a global leader in the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of novel therapies, Biogen Idec transforms scientific discoveries into advances in human healthcare. Total revenues in 2004 exceeded $2.2 billion. With patients in more than 90 countries, two blockbuster products lead Biogen Idec's product lineup:
RITUXAN was discovered by Biogen Idec for the treatment of certain B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). The company co-promotes the product in the United States with Genentech, Inc. In 2004, RITUXAN generated U.S. net sales of $1.57 billion of which Biogen Idec recorded $469.5 million as co-promotion profits.
AVONEX is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of MS and is the most prescribed product in MS worldwide with close to 130,000 patients on therapy. In 2004, sales of AVONEX generated worldwide revenues of $1.42 billion.
The company has two other marketed products: ZEVALIN (Ibritumomab tiuxetan) and AMEVIVE which were launched in 2002 and 2003, respectively.
 
Page 4 Biogen Idec Announces Strategic Initiative
In November 2004, Biogen Idec, in partnership with Elan Corporation plc., received FDA approval for TYSABRI. The companies voluntarily suspended the marketing and clinical dosing of TYSABRI on February 28, 2005 based on reports of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare and potentially fatal, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system.

Safe Harbor
This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our growth and performance, the continuing strength of AVONEX and RITUXAN, the potential for TYSABRI, RITUXAN in RA and PANACLAR, reductions in our operating expenses and our enhanced economic flexibility, our commitment of capital to business development and research opportunities, the results of business development and research activities, our divestment of certain assets, and the effects of our broad restructuring. These statements are based on our current beliefs and expectations. A number of risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially. For example, our growth and performance, and the overall prospects for our products as well as our business development and research activities, may be affected by a number of factors, including any unexpected slowing of growth in the markets for AVONEX and RITUXAN, any change in acceptance of AVONEX and RITUXAN in key markets worldwide, the impact of reimbursement and pricing decisions related to our products, the impact of competitive products on our products, any material decreases in sales by licensees of products on which we receives royalties, the impact of litigation on us, the impact of costs related to the suspension of TYSABRI, increases in costs related to, or an inability for us to effect on acceptable terms, in-licensing, collaborations and acquisitions involving product opportunities, increases in costs related to research and development of new products as well as increases in costs related to development of existing products in new indications, an inability for us to achieve acceptable terms from third parties for assets which have been proposed for divestment, and any material issues, delays or failures related to the manufacturing or supply of our products.
Our long-term growth will depend on the successful development and commercialization of new products as well as the development and commercialization of existing products in new indications (such as RITUXAN in RA). Drug development involves a high degree of risk. For example, our plans for development programs could be negatively affected if unexpected concerns arise from existing or additional data or analysis, if regulatory authorities require additional information or further studies, or if we were to encounter other unexpected hurdles.
The potential for TYSABRI is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. There is no assurance, for example, that we will be able to gain sufficient information to fully understand the risks associated with the product. There is also no assurance that we (or our partner, Elan Corporation plc.) will be able to resume marketing and sales of TYSABRI.
 
Page 5 Biogen Idec Announces Strategic Initiative
The completion of the TYSABRI safety evaluation is also subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the difficulty of analyzing complex data and results, and unanticipated logistical hurdles.
For more detailed information on the risks and uncertainties associated with these forward looking statements and our other activities, see our periodic reports which we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

Adjournments
     2.9 . Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation of the corporation, each stockholder shall at every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote for each share of the capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder.

Section 6.1
     (b) To obtain indemnification under this , a claimant shall submit to the corporation a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the claimant and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the claimant is entitled to indemnification. Upon written request by a claimant for indemnification pursuant to the preceding sentence, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to the claimant's entitlement thereto shall be made as follows: (i) if requested
Section 6.1
 
by the claimant, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined), or (ii) if no request is made by the claimant for a determination by Independent Counsel, (A) by the Board by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), even though less than a quorum, or (B) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (C) if there are no Disinterested Directors or the Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to the claimant, or (D) if a quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs, by the stockholders of the corporation. In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel at the request of the claimant, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board unless there shall have occurred within two years prior to the date of the commencement of the proceeding for which indemnification is claimed a "Change of Control" (as hereinafter defined), in which case Independent Counsel shall be selected by the claimant unless the claimant shall request that such selection be made by the Board. If it is so determined that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, payment to the claimant shall be made within ten (10) business days after such determination.
     (c) If a claim for the indemnification under this is not paid in full by the corporation within ninety (90) days after a written claim pursuant to above has been received by the corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct that makes it permissible under the DGCL for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation (including the Board, Independent Counsel or stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including the Board, Independent Counsel or stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
Section 6.1
Section 6.1(b)
     (d) If a determination shall have been made pursuant to this that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, the corporation shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to above. The corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to above that the procedures and presumptions of this are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in such proceeding that the corporation is bound by all the provisions of this .

Section 6.1
     6.3 . The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this shall not be deemed exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the certificate of incorporation of the corporation, bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

EXHIBIT 99.1
Biogen Idec (NASDAQ: BIIB) and Elan Corporation, plc. (NYSE: ELN) announced today that they have submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for TYSABRI (natalizumab) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS).
Cambridge, MA and Dublin, Ireland  September 26, 2005 
The sBLA includes:
The companies have requested Priority Review status for the sBLA which, if granted, would result in action by the FDA approximately six months from the submission date, rather than 10 months for a standard review.
Biogen Idec and Elan will submit a similar data package to the European Medicines Agency (EMEA). This information will be supplied as part of the ongoing review process, which was initiated in the summer 2004 with the filing for approval of TYSABRI as a treatment for MS.
"We are grateful to the MS community for their patience and support over the last several months while we've conducted an extensive safety evaluation of TYSABRI in collaboration with leading experts. We look forward to working with regulatory authorities during the review process, and ultimately, we hope to provide TYSABRI to people living with MS, a disease with significant unmet need," said Burt Adelman, MD, executive vice president, Development, Biogen Idec.

in MS
"We are very encouraged by this filingWe strongly believe in the therapeutic benefit of TYSABRI and the difference it could make in the lives of patients with MS. We are committed to working closely with regulatory authorities to define a path forward for TYSABRI as a treatment choice for patients who struggle with the debilitating effects of the disease," said Lars Ekman, MD, executive vice president and president, Research and Development, Elan.
.
On February 28, 2005, Biogen Idec and Elan announced that they voluntarily suspended TYSABRI from the U.S. market and all ongoing clinical trials based on reports of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare and potentially fatal, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Biogen Idec and Elan subsequently launched a comprehensive safety evaluation in collaboration with leading experts in PML and MS.

Safe Harbor/Forward Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding the potential and regulatory path forward of TYSABRI. The commercial potential and regulatory path forward of TYSABRI are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.

Drug development and commercialization involves a high degree of risk. For more detailed information on the risks and uncertainties associated with the companies' drug development and other activities, see the periodic reports that Biogen Idec and Elan have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The companies assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Cambridge, MA, October 26, 2005  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB), a global biotechnology leader with leading products and capabilities in oncology, neurology and immunology, today reported its third quarter 2005 results.
Third Quarter Highlights
 
     
Page 2
Biogen Idec Reports Third Quarter 2005 Earnings
"We previously announced our strategic plan to reduce operating expenses to fund increased business development activities in order to accelerate long-term growth," said James C. Mullen, Biogen Idec's Chief Executive Officer. "During the quarter, we have progressed against these goals by signing the partnership with PDL to jointly develop and commercialize three Phase II antibodies. Additionally, we achieved several key near-term milestones including the completion of the extensive safety evaluation of TYSABRI(natalizumab), the submission of TYSABRI's regulatory filings for multiple sclerosis (MS) in the US and Europe, and the submission of RITUXAN's regulatory filings for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the US."
Financial Performance
On an adjusted non-GAAP basis, Biogen Idec's net income was $122 million in the third quarter of 2005 (Q3 2004 adjusted non-GAAP: $132 million). Adjusted non-GAAP EPS were $0.36 for the third quarter of 2005 (Q3 2004 adjusted non-GAAP: $0.37).
On a reported basis, calculated in accordance with GAAP, Biogen Idec reported net income of $27 million (or EPS of $0.08) in the third quarter of 2005 (Q3 2004: net income of $37 million, or EPS of $0.10). The difference between adjusted non-GAAP net income and EPS and GAAP net income and EPS in the third quarter were primarily due to:
These adjustments are itemized on Table 3.
Revenue Performance
Revenues for the third quarter of 2005 were up 14% to $182 million (Q3 2004: $160 million) from Biogen Idec's joint business arrangement with Genentech related to RITUXAN, a treatment for certain B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) that Biogen Idec co-promotes in the U.S. with Genentech. All U.S. sales of RITUXAN are recognized by Genentech, and Biogen Idec records its share of the pretax co-promotion

profits on a quarterly basis. U.S. net sales of RITUXAN were $456 million in the third quarter of 2005 (Q3 2004: $393 million), as reported by Genentech.
Revenues from AVONEX, Biogen Idec's therapy for patients with relapsing forms of MS, increased 8% in the third quarter to $375 million (Q3 2004: $346 million). AVONEX, the leading therapy for MS in the U.S. as measured by revenues, patients, and total prescriptions, reported sales of $235 million in U.S. sales for the quarter (Q3 2004: $224 million). International sales increased 15% to $140 million in the third quarter of 2005 (Q3 2004: $122 million).
Table 4 provides individual product revenues.
Royalties were $23 million in the third quarter of 2005 (Q3 2004: $24 million).
Financial Guidance
Biogen Idec estimates that its 2006 non-GAAP earnings per share, excluding the impact of stock option expensing (FAS123R), will be in the range of $1.95  $2.10. Guidance regarding the impact of FAS123R will be provided at a later date.
The Company anticipates that 2006 capital expenditures will be in the range of $200  $275 million.
Guidance for full year 2006 reported earnings per share (GAAP-based financial measure) is not currently accessible as the Company cannot predict with any certainty the nature or the amount of non-operating or unusual charges for subsequent quarters. The Company does, however, anticipate that it may have to take such charges in subsequent quarters and that such charges, if material, would cause reported earnings per share to differ from operating earnings per share.

About Biogen Idec
Safe Harbor
This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding expected future financial results, including the financial objectives of the Company's strategic restructuring plan, short and long-term growth, plans for external growth and the Company's development programs, the potential for TYSABRI, and the Company's commitment of significant additional capital to external business development and research opportunities.
These statements are based on the Company's current beliefs and expectations. A number of risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially. For example, financial results, short and long-term growth, plans for external growth and development programs, and the commitment of significant additional capital to external business development and research opportunities may be affected by a number of factors, including any unexpected slowing of growth of the markets for AVONEX and RITUXAN, any change in market acceptance of AVONEX and RITUXAN in key markets worldwide, the impact of reimbursement and pricing decisions related to the Company's products, the impact of competitive products on the Company's products, any material decreases in sales by licensees of products on which the Company receives royalties, the impact of litigation, the impact of costs related to the suspension of TYSABRI, increases in costs related to, or an inability for us to enter into on acceptable terms, in-licensing deals, collaborations or acquisitions, increases in costs related to research and development of new products as well as increases in costs related to development of existing products in new indications, an inability for us to achieve acceptable terms from third parties for assets which have been proposed for divestment, and any material issues, delays or failures related to the manufacturing or supply of the Company's products.
Our long-term growth will depend on the successful development and commercialization of new products as well as the development and commercialization of existing products in new indications (such as RITUXAN in RA). Drug development involves a high degree of risk. For example, the plans for our development programs could be negatively

affected if unexpected concerns arise from additional data or analysis, if regulatory authorities require additional information or further studies, or if we were to encounter other unexpected hurdles.
The potential for TYSABRI is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. There is no assurance, for example, that we will be able to gain sufficient information to fully understand the risks associated with the product. There is also no assurance that the Company and Elan will be able to resume marketing and sales of TYSABRI.
For more detailed information on the risks and uncertainties associated with these forward looking statements and the Company's other activities, see the periodic reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
 
 
TABLE 2
 
The non-GAAP financial measures presented below are utilized by Biogen Idec management to gain an understanding of the comparative financial performance of the Company. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they exclude those non-operational activities or transactions that are not necessarily relevant to understanding the trends of the Company or the prospects of future performance. The presentation of this information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Numbers may not foot due to rounding.
Adjustments were made to conform prior periods to current year presentation including adoption of EITF 03-06, which requires allocation of income to certain holders of equity and debt instruments.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On December 6, 2005, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Biogen Idec Inc. (the "Company"), upon the recommendation of the Board's Finance and Audit Committee, approved the acceleration of vesting of unvested stock options having an exercise price per share of $55.00 or higher, granted under the Company's stock option plans that are held by the Company's current employees, including executive officers. Options held by the Company's non-employee directors are excluded from this vesting acceleration. As a result of such acceleration, options granted predominantly from 2001 to 2005 with respect to approximately 4,717,767 shares of the Company's common stock are subject to this acceleration. These options represent approximately 15.2 percent of the total shares of Company common stock subject to outstanding options and, prior to such acceleration, approximately 44.4 percent of the total shares of Company common stock subject to outstanding unvested options. The Board also imposed restrictions on shares of Company common stock that could be acquired by the Company's executive officers upon exercise of any such accelerated options that will prevent the sale of such shares (other than to cover the exercise price or satisfy withholding taxes) before such time as vesting would otherwise have taken place (or, if earlier, an executive officer's last day of employment). In addition, holders of incentive stock options, or ISOs, within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, may elect to decline the acceleration of their ISOs if it would have the effect of changing the status of such options for federal income tax purposes from ISOs to non-qualified stock options.
     The acceleration eliminates future compensation expense that the Company would otherwise recognize in its consolidated statement of operations with respect to the options at issue now that the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) "Share Based Payment," issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, has become effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The future expense eliminated by the acceleration, based on a Black-Scholes calculation and assuming no holders of ISOs elect to decline such acceleration, is estimated to be approximately $31.6 million in 2006, $31.5 million in 2007, $29.2 million in 2008 and $4.1 million in 2009 on a pre-tax basis. The acceleration will not result in any compensation expense in 2005.

     On February 7, 2006, the Registrant's Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Registrant's Compensation and Management Development Committee (the "Compensation Committee"), approved the 2006 annual base salary and 2005 cash bonus of the Registrant's Chief Executive Officer.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Definitive Material Agreement
     On February 14, 2006, the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Registrant's Board of Directors approved grants of 20,000 options for the purchase of the Registrant's common stock and 8,000 restricted stock units to be settled in shares of the Registrant's common stock to Susan H. Alexander, Executive Vice President, General Counsel. The grants were made under the Registrant's 2005 Omnibus Equity Plan. The restricted stock units vest as to 33 1/3% of the units upon Ms. Alexander's completion of one year of service with the Registrant from the date of grant, and as to an additional 33 1/3% for each year of service thereafter, until fully vested, except as otherwise provided in the 2005 Omnibus Equity Plan. The stock options vest as to 25% of the shares upon Ms. Alexander's completion of one year of service with the Registrant from the date of grant, and as to an additional 25% of the shares for each year of service thereafter, until fully vested, except as otherwise provided in the 2005 Omnibus Equity Plan. The exercise price for the stock options is $44.38, the closing price of the Registrant's common stock on February 14, 2006.
Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes information with respect to the Registrant's adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share and net income for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2005 and 2004. These are non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures are utilized by management to gain an understanding of the comparative financial performance of the Registrant's business. The Registrant's management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they exclude those non-operational activities or transactions that are not necessarily relevant to understanding the trends of the Registrant's business or the prospects of future performance such as charges related to purchased in-process research and development, amortization of intangibles, inventory step-up values, in period costs of sales and certain litigation. The Registrant's management uses these measures to establish operational goals and believes that these non-GAAP measures may assist investors in analyzing the underlying trends in the Registrant's business over time. The presentation of this information in the press release is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial measures.
     This press release is being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section, nor shall such documents be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Cambridge, MA, February 15, 2006  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB), a global biotechnology leader with leading products and capabilities in oncology, neurology and immunology, today reported its full year 2005 and fourth quarter results.
Full Year & Fourth Quarter Highlights
 
Page 2 Biogen Idec Reports Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2005 Results
James Mullen, Biogen Idec's Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Our discipline and successful execution in 2005 led to very robust performance of the core business resulting in strong revenue and bottom line growth, despite a challenging year. We anticipate major approvals for RITUXAN in rheumatoid arthritis and TYSABRI in multiple sclerosis in 2006."
Financial Performance
On an adjusted non-GAAP basis, Biogen Idec reported net income of $165 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 and $542 million for the full year 2005. Adjusted non-GAAP EPS was $0.48 for the fourth quarter of 2005 and $1.57 for the full year 2005. These adjustments are itemized on Table 3.
On a reported basis, calculated in accordance with GAAP, Biogen Idec reported net income of $56 million (or EPS of $0.16) in the fourth quarter of 2005 and net income of $161 million (or EPS of $0.47) for the full year 2005. The difference between adjusted non-GAAP net income and EPS and GAAP net income and EPS in the fourth quarter were primarily due to:
Revenue Performance
Revenues from AVONEX, Biogen Idec's therapy for patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), increased 12% in the fourth quarter to $413 million. Full year AVONEX sales increased 9% to $1.54 billion. In 2005, U.S. sales were $939 million and international sales increased 22% to $604 million.
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2005 and full year 2005 included $182 million and $709 million, respectively, from Biogen Idec's joint business arrangement with Genentech, Inc. related to RITUXAN, a treatment for certain B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas that Biogen Idec co-promotes in the U.S. with Genentech. All U.S. sales of RITUXAN are recognized by Genentech, and Biogen Idec records its share of the pretax co-promotion profits on a quarterly basis. U.S. net sales of RITUXAN were $484 million in the fourth quarter (Q4 2004: $429 million) and $1.83 billion for the full year (2004: $1.57 billion), as reported by Genentech.
Table 4 provides individual product revenues.
 
Page 3 Biogen Idec Reports Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2005 Results
Royalties were $22 million in the fourth quarter and $93 million for the full year.
Financial Guidance
Biogen Idec expects that its 2006 non-GAAP earnings per share estimates, excluding the impact of stock option expensing (FAS123R), will be in the range of $1.95  $2.10. The impact of FAS123R for 2006 is estimated to be in the range of $0.06  $0.09.
The Company anticipates that 2006 capital expenditures will be in the range of $190  $275 million.
Guidance for full year 2006 reported earnings per share (GAAP-based financial measure) is not currently known, as the Company cannot predict with any certainty the nature or the amount of non-operating or unusual charges for subsequent quarters. The Company does anticipate that certain charges related to Purchase Accounting will be included in the GAAP financials, such as amortization of intangibles (approximately $300  330 million or approximately $0.64  0.71 per share, primarily related to the AVONEX intangibles). The Company additionally anticipates that it may have to take other charges in subsequent quarters and that such charges, if material, would cause reported earnings per share to further differ from non-GAAP earnings per share.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Safe Harbor
This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding expected future financial results, including non-GAAP EPS and capital expenditures, external growth opportunities, pipeline growth, and the potential for TYSABRI in MS and RITUXAN in RA.
These statements are based on the Company's current beliefs and expectations. A number of risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially. For example, financial results and external growth opportunities may be affected by a number of factors, including any unexpected slowing of growth of the markets for AVONEX and RITUXAN, any change in market acceptance of AVONEX and RITUXAN in key markets worldwide, the impact of reimbursement and pricing decisions related to the Company's products, the impact of competitive products on the Company's products, any material decreases in sales by licensees of products on which the Company receives royalties, the impact of litigation, increases in costs related to, or an inability for us to enter into in-licensing deals, collaborations or acquisitions on acceptable terms, increases in costs related to research and development of new products as well as increases in costs related to development of existing products in new indications, an inability for us to achieve acceptable terms from third parties for assets which have been proposed for divestment, and any material issues, delays or failures related to the manufacturing or supply of the Company's products.
Our long-term growth will depend on the successful development and commercialization of new products as well as the development and commercialization of existing products in new indications (such as RITUXAN in RA). Drug development involves a high degree of risk. For example, the plans for our development programs could be negatively affected if unexpected concerns arise from additional data or analysis, if regulatory authorities require additional information or further studies, or if we were to encounter other unexpected hurdles.
The potential for TYSABRI in MS is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. There is no assurance, for example, that we will be able to gain sufficient information to fully understand the risks associated with the product. There is also no assurance that the Company and Elan will be able to resume marketing and sales of TYSABRI.
For more detailed information on the risks and uncertainties associated with these forward looking statements and the Company's other activities, see the periodic reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Cambridge, MA, April 26, 2006  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB), a global biotechnology leader with leading products and capabilities in oncology, neurology and immunology, today reported its first quarter 2006 results.
First Quarter 2006 Highlights
 
Page 2 Biogen Idec Reports First Quarter 2006 Results
James Mullen, Biogen Idec's Chief Executive Officer, commented, "During the quarter we took several key steps to secure the continued growth of our core business, specifically achieving major milestones with two products, TYSABRI and RITUXAN. We are pleased with the unanimous vote by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Advisory Committee supporting the reintroduction of TYSABRI and expect to have this important therapeutic option available to multiple sclerosis patients later this year. The approval and launch of RITUXAN in rheumatoid arthritis has allowed us to expand our business focus and enter a therapeutic area with significant unmet medical need."
Financial Performance
On a reported basis, calculated in accordance with GAAP, Biogen Idec reported net income of $123 million (or EPS of $0.36) in the first quarter of 2006 (Q1 2005: net income of $43 million, or EPS of $0.12).
The 2006 first quarter results include an after-tax credit of $4 million ($0.01 per share after-tax) attributable to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle associated with the adoption of FAS 123R on January 1, 2006. The cumulative effect adjustment reflects the impact of estimating forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant instead of the prior accounting practice of recognizing forfeitures as incurred.
The difference between non-GAAP net income and EPS and GAAP net income and EPS in the first quarter are itemized in Table 3 and are primarily due to:
On a non-GAAP basis, Biogen Idec reported net income of $189 million in the first quarter of 2006 (Q1 2005 non-GAAP: $106 million). Non-GAAP EPS were $0.55 for the first quarter of 2006 (Q1 2005 non-GAAP: $0.30).
Revenue Performance for the 3 Months ended March 31, 2006:
 
Page 3 Biogen Idec Reports First Quarter 2006 Results
Financial Guidance
Biogen Idec continues to expect that its 2006 non-GAAP earnings per share will be in the range of $1.95  $2.10.
Guidance for full year 2006 reported earnings per share (GAAP-based financial measure) is not currently known, as the Company cannot predict with any certainty the nature or the amount of non-operating or unusual charges for subsequent quarters. The Company does anticipate that certain charges related to purchase accounting will be included in the GAAP financials, such as amortization of intangibles of approximately $250  330 million, primarily related to the AVONEX intangibles. Separately, the impact of stock options being expensed due to FAS 123R in 2006 is now estimated to be in the range of $0.08  $0.12. The Company additionally anticipates that it may have to take other charges in subsequent quarters and that such charges, if material, would cause reported earnings per share to further differ from non-GAAP earnings per share.
The Company anticipates that 2006 capital expenditures will be in the range of $190  $275 million.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Safe Harbor
This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding expected future financial results, including non-GAAP EPS and capital expenditures, the potential reintroduction of TYSABRI in MS, and the potential for RITUXAN in RA.
These statements are based on the Company's current beliefs and expectations. A number of risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially. For example, financial results and external growth opportunities may be affected by a number of factors, including any unexpected slowing of growth of the markets for AVONEX and RITUXAN, any change in market acceptance of AVONEX and RITUXAN in key markets worldwide, the impact of reimbursement and pricing decisions related to the Company's products, the impact of competitive products on the Company's products, any material decreases in royalties which the Company receives, the impact of litigation, increases in costs related to, or an inability for us to enter into in-licensing deals, collaborations or acquisitions on acceptable terms, increases in costs related to research and development of new products as well as increases in costs related to development of existing products in new indications, and any material issues, delays or failures related to the manufacturing or supply of the Company's products.
Our long-term growth will depend on the successful development and commercialization of new products as well as the development and commercialization of existing products in new indications. Drug development involves a high degree of risk. For example, the plans for our development programs could be negatively affected if unexpected concerns arise from additional data or analysis, if regulatory authorities require additional information or further studies, or if we were to encounter other unexpected hurdles.
The potential for TYSABRI in MS is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. There is no assurance, for example, that we will be able to gain sufficient information to fully understand the risks associated with the product. There is also no assurance that the Company and Elan will be able to resume marketing and sales of TYSABRI.
For more detailed information on the risks and uncertainties associated with these forward looking statements and the Company's other activities, see the periodic reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this table are utilized by Biogen Idec management to gain an understanding of the comparative financial performance of the Company. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they exclude those non-operational activities or transactions that are not necessarily relevant to understanding the trends of the Company or the prospects of future performance. Management uses these measures to establish operational goals and believes that non-GAAP measures may assist investors in analyzing the underlying trends in the Company's business over time.

Item 1.01
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Directors Equity Plan
     On May 25, 2006, at the annual meeting of the registrant's stockholders (the "2006 Annual Meeting"), the stockholders approved the registrant's 2006 Non-Employee Directors Equity Plan (the "Directors Equity Plan"). A description of the material terms and conditions of the Directors Equity Plan is included in the registrant's Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A for the 2006 Annual Meeting filed on April 14, 2006.
Director Compensation
     On May 24, 2005, the registrant's Board of Directors changed the annual period for which non-employee directors receive compensation from a calendar year to the approximately one-year period extending from one annual meeting of the registrant's stockholder's to the next annual meeting of stockholders. This change, which took effect as of the 2006 Annual Meeting, was made to coordinate the period for which directors are compensated with the election of directors at annual meetings of stockholders.
     
Director Equity Grants
     On May 24, 2006, the registrant's Board of Directors, approved a grant to each of the registrant's non-employee directors, Bruce R. Ross, Alan Belzer, Lawrence C. Best, Alan B. Glassberg, Mary L. Good, Thomas F. Keller, Robert W. Pangia, Lynn Schenk, Philip A. Sharp and William D. Young, of a ten-year option to purchase 3,125 shares of the registrant's common stock at a price of $46.99 per share, exercisable upon completion of one year of service with the registrant from May 25, 2006, and 1,250 restricted stock units to be settled only in shares of the registrant's common stock, which fully vest upon completion of one year of service with the registrant from May 25, 2006. The option and restricted stock units were granted pursuant to, and are subject to the provisions of, the Directors Equity Plan.
     In making these equity grants, the Board of Directors took into consideration the effect of the change in the annual period for which non-employee directors receive compensation and the stock option grants for calendar year 2006 previously made to the registrant's non-employee directors.
     
Compensation Arrangement for the Chairman of the Board
     On May 24, 2006 the registrant's Board of Directors approved an annual compensation arrangement for Bruce R. Ross, the registrant's Chairman of the Board. Pursuant to the arrangement, Mr. Ross will receive an annual retainer of $60,000. Mr. Ross also was granted a ten-year option to purchase 6,250 shares of the registrant's common stock at a price of $46.99 per share, exercisable upon completion of one year of service with the registrant from May 25, 2006, and 2,500 restricted stock units to be settled only in shares of the registrant's common stock, which fully vest upon completion of one year of service with the registrant from May 25, 2006. The option and restricted stock units were granted pursuant to, and are subject to the
 
provisions of, the Directors Equity Plan. The retainer and equity awards are in addition to the compensation Mr. Ross receives as a non-employee director and as the chair of the Compensation and Management Development Committee.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Compensatory Arrangement
          The registrant today announced that Cecil B. Pickett, Ph.D. has been named President, Research and Development. Dr. Pickett is expected to commence employment with the registrant in early September.
          Dr. Pickett's offer letter provides that he will receive, among other things, an annual base salary of $775,000 and, pursuant to an annual cash incentive compensation plan, an annual target bonus opportunity equal to 75% of his annual base salary. Dr. Pickett also will receive a one-time sign-on bonus of $500,000 structured as a nonqualified deferred compensation benefit. In the event Dr. Pickett's employment is terminated by the registrant other than "for cause" (as defined in the offer letter) or by Dr. Pickett for "good cause" (as defined in the offer letter) prior to his reaching the age of 65 years, he will receive severance benefits that include an amount equal to up to 21 months of his annual base salary and annual target bonus. In addition, all of his outstanding equity awards will become immediately vested and exercisable, and will remain so until the earlier of the expiration of the award(s) term and one year from the date of termination. If payments made to Dr. Pickett pursuant the offer letter are subject to excise tax under Internal Revenue code Section 4999, the offer letter provides that the registrant will pay Dr. Pickett an additional amount such that the amount retained by him will be equal to net amount of payments which would have been received by him absent application of the excise tax.
          Dr. Pickett's offer letter provides that he will receive (i) a grant of 44,400 restricted stock units that will vest and be settled in shares of the registrant's common stock at a rate of one-third per year for three years beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date, and (ii) a grant of 120,000 restricted stock units that will vest and be settled in shares of the registrant's common stock at a rate of one-fourth per year for four years beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. The grant dates will be the first trading day of the month following Dr. Pickett's commencement of employment with the registrant. Dr. Pickett also will receive a grant of 120,000 performance-based restricted stock units. The performance criteria and vesting dates (which will occur over a four-year service period beginning on the grant date) are under development and are subject to approval by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the registrant's Board of Directors. The grant date of the performance-based restricted stock units will be date of Committee approval.
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers.
Election of Director
          On July 12, 2006, the Board of Directors of the registrant elected Dr. Pickett to the Board of Directors as a class 2 director (term expires in 2008), effective on the first day of his employment with the registrant. He fills a vacant seat on the Board of Directors. Dr. Pickett is not expected to serve on any committee of the Board of Directors because of his position with the registrant. He will receive no compensation for his service on the Board of Directors, beyond that which he receives for his position with the registrant.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Cambridge, MA, July 26, 2006  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB), a global biotechnology company with leading products and capabilities in oncology, neurology and immunology, today reported its second quarter 2006 results.
Second Quarter 2006 Highlights
 
Page 2     Biogen Idec Reports Second Quarter 2006 Results
disability and reduce the frequency of clinical relapses. Recently, patient dosing has begun in both Europe and the U.S.
James Mullen, Biogen Idec's Chief Executive Officer, commented, "The core businesses demonstrated double-digit growth in the second quarter, driven by strong AVONEX and RITUXAN performance. With TYSABRI recently approved in both the US and Europe, this important therapeutic option is now available to the multiple sclerosis community. We expect TYSABRI will enhance our neurology business and begin to accelerate top-line growth over the coming quarters. Additionally, we completed two acquisitions of private companies this quarter and continue to focus on business development opportunities."
Financial Performance
On a reported basis, calculated in accordance with GAAP, Biogen Idec reported a net loss of $171 million (or loss per share of $0.50) in the second quarter of 2006 (Q2 2005: net income of $35 million, or EPS of $0.10).
On a non-GAAP basis, Biogen Idec reported non-GAAP EPS of $0.57 for the second quarter of 2006 (Q2 2005 non-GAAP EPS: $0.43). Non-GAAP net income was $197 million in the second quarter of 2006 (Q2 2005 non-GAAP net income: $149 million).
The differences between non-GAAP net income and EPS and GAAP net income and EPS in the second quarter are itemized in Table 3 and are primarily due to:
Revenue Performance for the 3 Months ended June 30, 2006

Financial Guidance
Biogen Idec continues to expect that its 2006 non-GAAP earnings per share will be in the range of $1.95-$2.10.
Guidance for full year 2006 reported earnings per share (GAAP-based financial measure) is not currently known, as the Company cannot predict with any certainty the nature or the amount of non-operating or unusual charges for subsequent quarters. The Company does anticipate that certain charges related to purchase accounting will be included in the GAAP financials, such as the write-off of acquired in-process R&D ($331 million recorded in the current quarter) and amortization of intangibles of approximately $250-$330 million, primarily related to the AVONEX intangibles. Separately, the impact of stock options being expensed due to FAS 123R in 2006 continues to be estimated to be in the range of $0.08  $0.12. Additionally, the Company anticipates that it may have to take other charges in subsequent quarters and that such charges, if material, would cause reported earnings per share to further differ from non-GAAP earnings per share.
The Company continues to anticipate that 2006 capital expenditures will be in the range of $190-$275 million.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release are utilized by Biogen Idec management to gain an understanding of the comparative financial performance of the Company. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they exclude those non-operational activities or transactions that are not necessarily relevant to understanding the trends of the Company or the prospects of future performance such as charges related to in-process R&D, amortization of intangibles, inventory step-up values, and employee stock option expense. Management uses these measures to establish operational goals and believes that non-GAAP measures may assist investors in analyzing the underlying trends in the Company's business over time. The presentation of this information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial measures.

Safe Harbor
This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding expected future financial results, including future growth rates, non-GAAP EPS and capital expenditures, and the potential for TYSABRI in MS and RITUXAN in RA.
A number of risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially. For example, financial results and external growth opportunities may be affected by a number of factors, including any unexpected slowness in the demand for TYSABRI, AVONEX, RITUXAN and ZEVALIN, the impact of reimbursement and pricing decisions related to the Company's products, the impact of competitive products on the Company's products, any material decreases in royalties which the Company receives, the impact of litigation, increases in costs related to or an inability for us to enter into in-licensing deals, collaborations or acquisitions on acceptable terms, increases in costs related to research and development of new products as well as increases in costs related to development of existing products in new indications, and any material issues, delays or failures related to the manufacturing or supply of the Company's products.
The potential for TYSABRI is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's current expectations include the risk that the incidence and/or risk of PML or other opportunistic infections in patients treated with TYSABRI may be higher than observed in clinical trials, that TYSABRI may not be accepted by the medical community and patients, or that the Company may encounter other unexpected issues.
Our long-term growth will depend on the successful development and commercialization of new products, such as BG-12, as well as the development and commercialization of existing products in new indications. Drug development involves a high degree of risk. For example, the plans for our development programs could be negatively affected if unexpected concerns arise from additional data or analysis, if regulatory authorities require additional information or further studies, or if we were to encounter other unexpected hurdles.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Cambridge, MA, October 31, 2006  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB), a global biotechnology company with leading products and capabilities in oncology, neurology and immunology, today reported its third quarter 2006 results.
Third Quarter 2006 Highlights
 
Page 2 Biogen Idec Reports Third Quarter 2006 Results
James Mullen, Biogen Idec's Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Robust double-digit growth, driven by strong AVONEX and RITUXAN performance, continues to define our business. Returning TYSABRI to the MS community was a remarkable achievement, and we expect this will enhance our neurology franchise and begin to accelerate top-line growth over the coming quarters. In keeping with our strategic plan, we made key investments in our pipeline this quarter, including three collaboration agreements, building on the momentum of last quarter's two acquisitions."
Financial Performance
On a reported basis, calculated in accordance with GAAP, Biogen Idec reported earnings per diluted share of $0.45 for the third quarter of 2006 (Q3 2005 diluted EPS was $0.08). Net income was $157 million in the third quarter of 2006 (Q3 2005 net income was $27 million).
On a non-GAAP basis, Biogen Idec reported non-GAAP EPS of $0.60 for the third quarter of 2006 (Q3 2005 non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.36). Non-GAAP net income was $207 million in the third quarter of 2006 (Q3 2005 non-GAAP net income was $122 million).
The differences between non-GAAP net income and EPS, and GAAP net income and EPS in the third quarter are itemized in Table 3, and are primarily due to:
Revenue Performance for the Three Months ended September 30, 2006
 
Page 3 Biogen Idec Reports Third Quarter 2006 Results
Share Repurchase Program
In October, Biogen Idec's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20 million shares of its common stock. The repurchased stock will provide the Company with authorized shares for general corporate purposes, such as stock to be issued under employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The share buyback will largely be funded through operating cash flow and is expected to be accretive to EPS.
The Company had approximately 336 million shares of common stock outstanding at the end of Q3 2006.
Financial Guidance
Biogen Idec is raising full year 2006 non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to exceed $2.20. This assumes ongoing business development activity for the remainder of the year at a similar level to third quarter 2006.
Guidance for full year 2006 reported earnings per share (GAAP-based financial measure) is estimated to exceed $0.65, excluding any future acquisitions or other transactions. The Company cannot predict with certainty the nature or the amount of non-operating or unusual charges for the fourth quarter. The Company does anticipate in its full year estimate that certain charges related to purchase accounting for completed transactions will be included in the GAAP financials, such as the write-off of acquired in-process R&D ($331 million), amortization of intangibles (approximately $270 million, gain on settlement of existing collaboration agreement ($34 million), and inventory step up (approximately $8 million). In addition, the impact of stock options being expensed due to FAS 123R in 2006 is estimated to be in the range of $50-60 million, or approximately $0.10  $0.12 per diluted share. Additionally, the Company anticipates that it may have to take other charges in the fourth quarter and that such charges, if material, would cause reported earnings per share to further differ from non-GAAP earnings per share.
The Company now anticipates that 2006 capital expenditures will be in the range of $190  $220 million.

ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS.
Biogen Idec Inc. and Genentech, Inc. are issuing a dear healthcare provider letter to physicians and other prescribers, including rheumatologists, neurologists, oncologists, hematologists, dermatologists, nephrologists, oncology nurses and oncology pharmacists, regarding updated safety information for Rituxan. The letter is currently posted on the Genentech, Inc. website.
The letter informs healthcare providers that two cases of progressive multifocal leuklencephalopathy (PML) resulting in death, have been reported in patients receiving Rituxan for treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Rituxanis not approved for the treatment of SLE.
PML is a rare, progressive, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that usually leads to death or severe disability. While rare, PML is a known risk in patients who have immune system suppression either because of their disease or the medications they are taking. PML has been reported in the literature in HIV-positive patients, immunosuppressed cancer patients, transplant patients, and patients with autoimmune disease, including SLE, who were not receiving Rituxan.
The two SLE patients had longstanding SLE with multiple courses of immunosuppressant therapy prior to receiving Rituxan. Rituxan monotherapy was the last treatment administered prior to the diagnosis of PML. PML has also been reported in the literature in patients with SLE receiving prednisone, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and other immunosuppressant agents, who were not receiving Rituxan.
Previously, cases of PML have also been reported in patients with hematologic malignancies during or up to one year after completion of Rituxan. The majority of these patients received Rituxan in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. A description of cases of PML in patients with hematologic malignancies treated with Rituxan is included in the current US prescribing information.
The Company and Genentech also informed healthcare providers that we are working with FDA to update the Rituxan prescribing information to include the new information.
Rituxan is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory, low-grade or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and for the first line treatment of follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL in combination with CVP chemotherapy. Rituxan is also indicated for the treatment of low-grade, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL in patients with stable disease or who achieve a partial or complete response following first-line treatment with CVP chemotherapy. Rituxan is also indicated for the first-line treatment of diffuse large B-cell, CD20-positive, NHL in combination with CHOP or other anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. Rituxan in combination with methotrexate is also indicated to reduce signs and symptoms in adult patients with moderately- to severely- active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF antagonist therapies. The safety and effectiveness of Rituxan for the treatment of SLE has not been established and SLE is not an FDA-approved indication.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Cambridge, MA, February 15, 2007  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB), a global biotechnology leader with leading products and capabilities in oncology, neurology and immunology, today reported its full year and fourth quarter 2006 results.

Page 2 Biogen Idec Reports Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2006 Results
James Mullen, Biogen Idec's Chief Executive Officer, commented, "In 2006, we built a strong foundation for future growth by executing against three key value drivers for the company. First, we significantly reinvested in the pipeline through partnerships, acquisitions, and strong internal development work, and today we have three compounds in registrational trials. Second, we successfully launched two products: RITUXAN in rheumatoid arthritis and TYSABRI for multiple sclerosis in the U.S. and Europe. With the introduction of a new therapeutic option for treating multiple sclerosis, we have found the MS community increasingly focused on TYSABRI's efficacy. Third, we made these investments while maintaining the core business, growing revenue by 11%, and we are on track to achieve 20% annualized non-GAAP diluted EPS growth for 2003  2007."
Fourth Quarter 2006 Highlights:
Financial Performance
On a non-GAAP basis, Biogen Idec reported net income of $184 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 and $777 million for the full year 2006. Non-GAAP diluted EPS were $0.53 for the fourth quarter of 2006 and $2.25 for the full year 2006.
On a reported basis, calculated in accordance with GAAP, Biogen Idec reported net income of $109 million (or diluted EPS of $0.32) in the fourth quarter of 2006 and net income of $218 million (or diluted EPS of $0.63) for the full year 2006. The reconciling items between GAAP net income and diluted GAAP EPS and adjusted non-GAAP net income and diluted non-GAAP EPS in the fourth quarter, as itemized in Table 3 within this press release, were primarily as follows:

Financial Guidance
Biogen Idec today provided guidance for the full year 2007. The Company anticipates for 2007:
Guidance for full year 2007 GAAP diluted EPS is estimated to be in the range of $1.69  $1.84, excluding any future acquisitions or other transactions. In order to reconcile GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance, we have excluded the following items from our non-GAAP EPS guidance provided above:
Because the Company cannot predict with certainty the nature or the amount of non-operating or unusual charges for 2007, we have made no assumption regarding future purchase accounting charges in this GAAP guidance. The Company may incur charges or realize gains in 2007 which could cause actual results to vary from this guidance.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our "non-GAAP net income" and "non-GAAP diluted EPS" financial measures are defined as reported, or GAAP, net income and diluted EPS excluding, for the reasons discussed below, (1) purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments, (2) stock option expense and the cumulative effect of an accounting change relating to the initial adoption of SFAS No. 123R and (3) other items. Our management uses these non-GAAP

financial measures to establish financial goals and to gain an understanding of the comparative financial performance of the Company from year to year and quarter to quarter. Accordingly, we believe investors' understanding of the Company's financial performance is enhanced as a result of our disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income and diluted EPS.
The Company has reconciled the GAAP net income and diluted EPS for the three-month periods and full years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 to the non-GAAP measures of net income and diluted EPS in Table 3 of this press release.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On May 29, 2007, in connection with a tender offer for up to 56,603,773 shares of its outstanding common stock, Biogen Idec Inc. (the "Registrant") entered into a commitment letter with Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation and Goldman, Sachs Credit Partners L.P. (collectively, the "Term Lenders") for a term loan of up to $1.5 billion, which would be used to finance part of the tender offer. The Registrant expects that the term loan would be available for a single draw and will mature 364 days after the draw.
     On May 29, 2007, the Registrant also entered into a commitment letter with Bank of America, N.A. and Merrill Lynch Bank USA (together with the Term Lenders, collectively referred to herein as the "Lenders") for a $400 million revolving credit facility that can be used after the date of the stock repurchase for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes. The revolving loans could be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until the fifth anniversary of the consummation of a purchase of shares pursuant to the tender offer.
     The Lenders' obligation to provide each of the term loan and the revolving credit facility is conditioned upon the Registrant consummating the purchase of a portion of the shares tendered pursuant to the tender offer in an aggregate purchase amount of at least $1.5 billion and other conditions common for facilities of this kind and the negotiation and execution of final documents by both the Lenders and the Company.
     The terms of the credit facilities are expected to require the Registrant to maintain a maximum leverage ratio with respect to its debt and in some cases a minimum interest coverage ratio. Additionally, the terms would obligate the Registrant to comply with affirmative and negative covenants.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
     On May 29, 2007, the Registrant issued a press release announcing that it is commencing a $3 billion share repurchase through a modified "Dutch Auction" tender offer. The approximately 57 million shares proposed to be purchased in the tender offer represent approximately 16% of the Registrant's currently outstanding common stock. In the tender offer, shareholders will have the opportunity to tender some or all of their shares at a price per share not less than $47.00 or more than $53.00. The tender offer will commence tomorrow, May 30, 2007, and is scheduled to expire at 12:00 midnight on June 26, 2007, unless extended.
     If completed, the stock repurchase is expected to be funded with a combination of up to $1.5 billion cash and up to $1.5 billion of debt pursuant to the term loan described above.
     A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and its contents are incorporated herein by reference.

"With strong cash flows from two of the most important franchises in biotechnology, RITUXAN and AVONEX, and our confidence in TYSABRI, we are well positioned to return value to shareholders while investing in our promising pipeline. Following this transaction, Biogen Idec will maintain the capacity to pursue substantial and attractively valued external growth opportunities," stated James C. Mullen, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Biogen Idec.
$3 Billion Share Repurchase Program
In the tender offer, shareholders will have the opportunity to tender some or all of their shares at a price per share not less than $47.00 or more than $53.00. The tender offer is commencing tomorrow, May 30, 2007, and is expected to expire at midnight Eastern Time on June 26, 2007, unless extended. The modified "Dutch Auction" structure will allow shareholders to indicate how many shares and at what price within the specified range they wish to tender. Based on the number of shares tendered and the prices specified by the tendering shareholders, the Company will determine the lowest price per share within the range that will enable it to purchase up to 57 million shares, or such lesser number of shares as are properly tendered. The Company will not purchase shares from a particular shareholder below the price stipulated by that shareholder but, in some
 
Page 2 Biogen Idec Announces $3 Billion Share Repurchase
cases, may purchase shares at prices above a shareholder's indication. Instructions and an explanation of the terms and conditions of the tender offer are contained in the offer to purchase and related materials that are being mailed to shareholders.
The tender offer will not be contingent upon any minimum number of shares being tendered. However, it will be subject to the completion of financing as specified in the offer to purchase.
If completed, the stock repurchase will be funded through a combination of up to $1.5 billion cash and up to $1.5 billion of debt. Currently, Biogen Idec has limited debt and a core business that generates substantial cash flow from operations.
Merrill Lynch & Co. and Goldman Sachs & Co. acted as financial advisors on this transaction. Biogen Idec has obtained a commitment letter from Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation and Goldman, Sachs Credit Partners L.P. for a $1.5 billion term loan which will be used to finance the tender offer.
This tender offer is in addition to the 20 million shares that the Company may repurchase under a previous stock repurchase authorization which remains in place. The Company had 343,161,482 shares of common stock outstanding as of May 25, 2007.

Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans. If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month. (b) Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount of its Applicable Percentage of the applicable Committed Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans described in the preceding subsection. In the case of a Committed Borrowing, each Lender shall make the amount of its Committed Loan available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agent's Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the applicable Committed Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (and, if such Borrowing is the Credit Extension, Section 4.01), the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation (or one of its Affiliates) with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower. (c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan. During the existence of a Default, no Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans without the consent of the Required Lenders. (d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. (e) After giving effect to all Committed Borrowings, all conversions of Committed Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Committed Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten (10) Interest Periods in effect with respect to Committed Loans. 21
2.03 INTENTIONALLY OMITTED. 2.04 INTENTIONALLY OMITTED. 2.05 PREPAYMENTS. (a) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Committed Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (A) three Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans and (B) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (ii) any prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and (iii) any prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Committed Loans to be prepaid and, if Eurodollar Rate Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05. Each such prepayment shall be applied to the Committed Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages. (b) (i) If, during the term of this Agreement, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries Disposes of any property (other than cash and cash equivalents, inventory and surplus or worn out equipment, all in the ordinary course of business and the sale of the business relating to the Zevalin product) with an aggregate book value in excess of $100,000,000 which results in the realization by such Person of Net Cash Proceeds, the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds immediately upon receipt thereof by such Person; provided, however, that, with respect to any Net Cash Proceeds realized under a Disposition described in this Section 2.05(b)(i), at the election of the Borrower (as notified by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of such Disposition), and so long as no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Borrower or such Subsidiary may reinvest all or any portion of such Net Cash Proceeds in operating assets so long as within 180 days after the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, either the purchase of such assets shall have been consummated (as certified by the Borrower in writing to the Administrative Agent) or the Borrower shall have entered into a definitive agreement to make such a purchase, and such purchase shall be consummated within 30 days thereafter; and provided further, however, that any Net Cash Proceeds not subject to such definitive agreement or so reinvested shall be immediately applied to the prepayment of the Loans as set forth in this Section 2.05(b)(i). (ii) Upon the sale or issuance by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of any of its Equity Interests (other than any sales or issuances of Equity Interests by any Subsidiary to the Borrower or another Subsidiary or by the Borrower to its employees or directors or by the 22
Borrower to finance an acquisition permitted by Section 7.02), the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of all Net Cash Proceeds received therefrom immediately upon receipt thereof by the Borrower or such Subsidiary. (iii) Upon the incurrence or issuance by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness expressly permitted to be incurred or issued pursuant to Section 7.03), the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of all Net Cash Proceeds received therefrom immediately upon receipt thereof by the Borrower or such Subsidiary. 2.06 INTENTIONALLY OMITTED. 2.07 REPAYMENT OF LOANS. The Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the Maturity Date the aggregate principal amount of Committed Loans outstanding on such date. 2.08 INTEREST. (a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each Eurodollar Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; and (ii) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate. (b) (i) If any amount of principal of any Loan is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. (ii) If any amount (other than principal of any Loan) payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then upon the request of the Required Lenders, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. (iii) Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand. (c) Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law. 2.09 FEES. (a) Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, a 23
commitment fee equal to the Applicable Rate times the actual daily amount by which the Aggregate Commitments exceed the Outstanding Amount of Committed Loans. The commitment fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period and until the Credit Extension is made, including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article IV is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the last day of the Availability Period. The commitment fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. (b) Other Fees. (i) The Borrower shall pay to the Arrangers and the Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the amounts and at the times as shall have been agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever. (ii) The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders additional upfront fees in an amount equal to the following percentages of such Lender's outstanding Loans on such dates: (1) 0.15% on December 31, 2007 in the event the most recent Debt Ratings are at or above BBB from S&P and Baa3 from Moody's and (ii) 0.10% on September 30, 2007, 0.15% on December 31, 2007 and 0.15% on March 31, 2008 in the event the then most recent Debt Ratings are lower than BBB from S&P or Baa3 from Moody's. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever. 2.10 COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES. All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by Merrill Lynch Capital's "prime rate" shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 2.11 EVIDENCE OF DEBT. The Committed Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Committed Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative 24
Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender's Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. 2.12 PAYMENTS GENERALLY; ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S CLAWBACK. (a) General. All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent's Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be. (b) (i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Committed Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Committed Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Committed Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Committed Loan 25
included in such Committed Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. (ii) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. (c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. (d) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Committed Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Committed Loan or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Committed Loan or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c). (e) Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 2.13 SHARING OF PAYMENTS BY LENDERS. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Committed Loans made by it resulting in such Lender's receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Committed Loans or accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Committed Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other 26
adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Committed Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that: (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and (ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Committed Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. ARTICLE III. TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY 3.01 TAXES. (a) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, provided that if the Borrower shall be required by applicable law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes (including any Other Taxes) from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (c) Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or 27
legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (d) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. (e) Status of Lenders. Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is resident for tax purposes, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States, any Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable: (i) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party, (ii) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a "bank" within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a "10 percent shareholder" of the Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a "controlled foreign corporation" described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, or (iv) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax duly completed 28
together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. (f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its good faith discretion, that it has received a refund or credit of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund or credit (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund or credit), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund or credit), provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund or credit to such Governmental Authority. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 3.02 ILLEGALITY. If any Lender determines in good faith that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until such Lender in good faith notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. 3.03 INABILITY TO DETERMINE RATES. If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan, or (c) the Eurodollar Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be 29
suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein. 3.04 INCREASED COSTS. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall: (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Eurodollar Rate); (ii) subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or any Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section 3.01 and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender); or (iii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. (b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender determines in good faith that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender's holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender hereunder, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered. (c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall 30
be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. (d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 3.05 COMPENSATION FOR LOSSES. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss (other than loss of Applicable Rate), cost or expense incurred by it as a result of: (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); (b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or (c) any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 10.13; excluding any loss of anticipated profits and including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing. For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Base Rate used in determining the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded. 3.06 MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS; REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS. (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its 31
rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. (b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04 or gives a notice under Section 3.02, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 10.13. 3.07 SURVIVAL.

The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 9.05 DELEGATION OF DUTIES.

The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with approval of the Borrower, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and which shall not be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this 52

In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the "Agent Parties") have any liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of the Borrower's or the Administrative Agent's transmission of Borrower Materials through the Internet, except to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent Party; provided, however, that in no event shall any Agent Party have any liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages). (d) Change of Address, Etc.

Furthermore, each Public Lender agrees to cause at least one individual at or on behalf of such Public Lender to at all times have selected the "Private Side Information" or similar designation on the content declaration screen of the Platform in order to enable such Public Lender or its delegate, in accordance with such Public Lender's compliance procedures and applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities Laws, to make reference to Borrower Materials that are not made available through the "Public Side Information" portion of the Platform and that may contain material non-public information with respect to the Borrower or its securities for purposes of United States Federal or state securities laws. (e) Reliance by Administrative Agent and Lenders. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any notices (including telephonic Committed Loan Notices) purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower even if (i) such notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Related Parties of each of them from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower. All telephonic notices to and other telephonic communications with the Administrative Agent may be recorded by the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such recording. 10.03 NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. No failure by any Lender or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law. 10.04 EXPENSES; INDEMNITY; DAMAGE WAIVER.

(b) Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify each Arranger, the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof), the Syndication Agent, each Lender and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related reasonable expenses (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee), incurred by any Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee by any third party or by the Borrower arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or, in the case of the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof) and its Related Parties only, the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (ii) any Loan or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom, (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the Borrower, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or its Related Parties in performing services in connection with this Agreement or (y) result from a claim brought by the Borrower against an Indemnitee for material breach of such Indemnitee's obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if the Borrower has obtained a final and nonappealable judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. (c) Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Borrower for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof) or any Related Party thereof, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount, provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) in connection with such capacity. The obligations of the Lenders under this subsection (c) are subject to the provisions of Section 2.12(d). 57
(d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed to such unintended recipients by such Indemnitee through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other than for direct or actual damages resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee as determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. (e) Payments. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than ten Business Days after demand therefor. (f) Survival. The agreements in this Section shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations. 10.05 PAYMENTS SET ASIDE. To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 10.06 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. (a) Successors and Assigns Generally. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section, or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of 58
subsection (f) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. (b) Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions: (i) Minimum Amounts. (A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and (B) in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if "Trade Date" is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a single Eligible Assignee (or to an Eligible Assignee and members of its Assignee Group) will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been met. (ii) Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned; (iii) Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition: (A) the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default under Section 8.01(a), 8.01(f) or 8.01(g) has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment, (2) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or 59
an Approved Fund or (3) if such assignment is reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent and the Syndication Agent to be necessary to achieve a "Successful Syndication" (as defined in the Engagement Letter); and (B) the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender. (iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. (v) No Assignment to Borrower. No such assignment shall be made to the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates or Subsidiaries. (vi) No Assignment to Natural Persons. No such assignment shall be made to a natural person. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, and 10.04 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section. (c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent's Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The 60
Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (d) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans; provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 10.01 that affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender. (e) Limitations upon Participant Rights. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 3.01(e) as though it were a Lender. (f) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. (g) Electronic Execution of Assignments. The words "execution," "signed," "signature," and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce 61
Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. 10.07 TREATMENT OF CERTAIN INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Arrangers, the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates' respective partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and representatives (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Borrower or (h) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to any Arranger, the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower. For purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to any Arranger, the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. Each of the Arrangers, the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent and the Lenders acknowledges that (a) the Information may include material non-public information concerning the Borrower or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information and (c) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities Laws. 10.08 RIGHT OF SETOFF. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other 62
obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of the Borrower may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such Lender different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness. The rights of each Lender and its Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or its Affiliates may have. Each Lender agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. 10.09 INTEREST RATE LIMITATION. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the "Maximum Rate"). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder. 10.10 COUNTERPARTS; INTEGRATION; EFFECTIVENESS. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. 10.11 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied. 63
10.12 SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. 10.13 REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice under Section 3.02, or if any Lender does not consent to a proposed amendment, waiver or other modification of any Loan Agreement requiring consent of all of the Lenders and which is consented to by the Required Lenders, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.06), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that: (a) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 10.06(b); (b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.05) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts); (c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and (d) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 10.14 GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; ETC.

(vi) The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (A) provided to the Administrative Agent in Article IX with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and Issuer Documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term "Administrative Agent" as used in Article IX included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (B) as additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C Issuer. (b) Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit. (i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the Borrower delivered to the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at least two Business Days (or such later date and time as the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (G) the purpose and nature of the requested Letter of Credit; and (H) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (A) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (B) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (C) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (D) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may reasonably require. Additionally, the Borrower shall furnish to the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any Issuer Documents, as the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent may reasonably require. (ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the Borrower and, if not, the L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless the L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Article IV shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the L/C Issuer's usual and customary 25
business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lender's Applicable Percentage times the amount of such Letter of Credit. (iii) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. (c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations. (i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an "Honor Date"), the Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing. If the Borrower fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the "Unreimbursed Amount"), and the amount of such Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. In such event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a Committed Loan Notice). Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. (ii) Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer at the Administrative Agent's Office in an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Committed Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer. (iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, 26
each Lender's payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.03. (iv) Until each Lender funds its Committed Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the L/C Issuer. (v) Each Lender's obligation to make Committed Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the L/C Issuer, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Lender's obligation to make Committed Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than delivery by the Borrower of a Committed Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. (vi) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii), the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the L/C Issuer in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Committed Loan included in the relevant Committed Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be. A certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (d) Repayment of Participations. (i) At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lender's L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of 27
Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent. (ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. (e) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document; (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that the Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit; (iv) any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or (v) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower or any Subsidiary. 28
The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Borrower's instructions or other irregularity, the Borrower will immediately notify the L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid. (f) Role of L/C Issuer. Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower's pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (v) of Section 2.03(e); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by the L/C Issuer's willful misconduct or gross negligence or the L/C Issuer's willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. (g) Cash Collateral. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, (i) if the L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, or (ii) if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, the Borrower shall, in each case, immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations. Sections 2.05 and 8.02(c) set forth certain additional requirements to deliver Cash Collateral hereunder. For purposes of this Section 2.03, Section 2.05 and Section 8.02(c), "Cash Collateralize" means to pledge and deposit with or deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, as collateral for the L/C Obligations, cash or deposit account balances pursuant to documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative 29
Agent and the L/C Issuer (which documents are hereby consented to by the Lenders). Derivatives of such term have corresponding meanings. The Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, a security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing. Cash Collateral shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at Bank of America. (h) Applicability of ISP. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the L/C Issuer and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued, the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit. (i) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage a Letter of Credit fee (the "Letter of Credit Fee") for each Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Rate times the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.06. Letter of Credit Fees shall be (i) due and payable on the first Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand and (ii) computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily amount available to be drawn under each Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of Default exists, all Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue at the Default Rate. (j) Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit, at the rate per annum specified in the Fee Letter, computed on the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such fronting fee shall be due and payable on the tenth Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December in respect of the most recently-ended quarterly period (or portion thereof, in the case of the first payment), commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.06. In addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of the L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable. (k) Conflict with Issuer Documents. In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document, the terms hereof shall control. 30
2.04 SWING LINE LOANS. (a) The Swing Line. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swing Line Lender agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in this Section 2.04, to make loans (each such loan, a "Swing Line Loan") denominated in Dollars to the Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during the Availability Period in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that such Swing Line Loans, when aggregated with the Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of Committed Loans and L/C Obligations of the Lender acting as Swing Line Lender, may exceed the amount of such Lender's Commitment; provided, however, that after giving effect to any Swing Line Loan, (i) the Total Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitments, and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Committed Loans of any Lender, plus such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, plus such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Lender's Commitment, and provided, further, that the Borrower shall not use the proceeds of any Swing Line Loan to refinance any outstanding Swing Line Loan. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.04, prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow under this Section 2.04. Each Swing Line Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan. Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swing Line Lender a risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of such Lender's Applicable Percentage times the amount of such Swing Line Loan. (b) Borrowing Procedures. Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made upon the Borrower's irrevocable notice to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify (i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $100,000, and (ii) the requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day. Each such telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent of a written Swing Line Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Promptly after receipt by the Swing Line Lender of any telephonic Swing Line Loan Notice, the Swing Line Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swing Line Loan Notice and, if not, the Swing Line Lender will notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof. Unless the Swing Line Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A) directing the Swing Line Lender not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the first proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.04(a), or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Article IV is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line Lender will, not later than 3:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Swing Line Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to the Borrower. 31
(c) Refinancing of Swing Line Loans. (i) The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole and absolute discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Lender make a Base Rate Committed Loan in an amount equal to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the amount of Swing Line Loans then outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Committed Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. The Swing Line Lender shall furnish the Borrower with a copy of the applicable Committed Loan Notice promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Lender shall make an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the amount specified in such Committed Loan Notice available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds for the account of the Swing Line Lender at the Administrative Agent's Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Committed Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to Section 2.04(c)(ii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Committed Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swing Line Lender. (ii) If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Committed Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.04(c)(i), the request for Base Rate Committed Loans submitted by the Swing Line Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line Lender that each of the Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Lender's payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation. (iii) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in Section 2.04(c)(i), the Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Swing Line Lender in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Swing Line Lender in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Committed Loan included in the relevant Committed Borrowing or funded participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan, as the case may be. A certificate of the Swing Line Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 32
(iv) Each Lender's obligation to make Committed Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swing Line Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Lender's obligation to make Committed Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to repay Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided herein. (d) Repayment of Participations. (i) At any time after any Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the Swing Line Lender receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Swing Line Lender. (ii) If any payment received by the Swing Line Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to be returned by the Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Swing Line Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swing Line Lender. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. (e) Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender. The Swing Line Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrower for interest on the Swing Line Loans. Until each Lender funds its Base Rate Committed Loan or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such Lender's Applicable Percentage of any Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such Applicable Percentage shall be solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender. (f) Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender. The Borrower shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans directly to the Swing Line Lender. 2.05 PREPAYMENTS. (a) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Committed Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (A) three Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans and (B) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Committed Loans; (ii) any prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of 33
$1,000,000 in excess thereof; and (iii) any prepayment of Base Rate Committed Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Committed Loans to be prepaid and, if Eurodollar Rate Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05. Each such prepayment shall be applied to the Committed Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages. (b) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Swing Line Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at any time or from time to time, voluntarily prepay Swing Line Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date of the prepayment, and (ii) any such prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $100,000. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. (c) If for any reason the Total Outstandings at any time exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect, the Borrower shall immediately prepay Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to such excess; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) unless after the prepayment in full of the Loans the Total Outstandings exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect. 2.06 TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS. The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate Commitments, or from time to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitments; provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. five Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (iii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Aggregate Commitments if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Outstandings would exceed the Aggregate Commitments, and (iv) if, after giving effect to any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swing Line Sublimit exceeds the amount of the Aggregate Commitments, such Sublimit shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate Commitments. Any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments shall be irrevocable and shall be applied to the Commitment of each Lender according to its Applicable Percentage. All fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Aggregate Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such termination. 34
2.07 REPAYMENT OF LOANS. (a) The Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the Maturity Date the aggregate principal amount of Committed Loans outstanding on such date. (b) The Borrower shall repay each Swing Line Loan on the earlier to occur of (i) the date ten Business Days after such Loan is made and (ii) the Maturity Date. 2.08 INTEREST. (a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each Eurodollar Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; (ii) each Base Rate Committed Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate; and (iii) each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate. (b) (i) If any amount of principal of any Loan is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. (ii) If any amount (other than principal of any Loan) payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then upon the request of the Required Lenders, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. (iii) Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand. (c) Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law. 2.09 FEES. In addition to certain fees described in subsections (i) and (j) of Section 2.03: (a) Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, a commitment fee equal to the Applicable Rate times the actual daily amount by which the Aggregate Commitments exceed the sum of (i) the Outstanding Amount of Committed Loans and (ii) the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations. The commitment fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period, including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article IV is not met, and 35
shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the last day of the Availability Period. The commitment fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. (b) Utilization Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, a utilization fee equal to the Applicable Rate times the Total Outstandings on each day that the Total Outstandings exceed 50% of the actual daily amount of the Aggregate Commitments then in effect (or, if terminated, in effect immediately prior to such termination). The utilization fee shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the last day of the Availability Period (and, if applicable, thereafter on demand). The utilization fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate for each period during which such Applicable Rate was in effect. The utilization fee shall accrue at all times, including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article IV is not met. (c) Other Fees. (i) The Borrower shall pay to the relevant Arrangers and the Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever. (ii) The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever. 2.10 COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES. All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by Bank of America's "prime rate" shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 2.11 EVIDENCE OF DEBT. (a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by 36
the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender's Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. (b) In addition to the accounts and records referred to in subsection (a), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. 2.12 PAYMENTS GENERALLY; ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S CLAWBACK. (a) General. All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent's Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be. (b) (i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Committed Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Committed Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Committed Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, 37
then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Committed Loan included in such Committed Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. (ii) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. (c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. (d) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Committed Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Committed Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its 38
corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Committed Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c). (e) Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 2.13 SHARING OF PAYMENTS BY LENDERS. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Committed Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations or in Swing Line Loans held by it resulting in such Lender's receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Committed Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Committed Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Committed Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that: (i) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and (ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Committed Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. ARTICLE III. TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY 3.01 TAXES. (a) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and 39
clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, provided that if the Borrower shall be required by applicable law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes (including any Other Taxes) from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (c) Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the L/C Issuer, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (d) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. (e) Status of Lenders. Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is resident for tax purposes, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States, any Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the 40
Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable: (i) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party, (ii) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a "bank" within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a "10 percent shareholder" of the Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a "controlled foreign corporation" described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, or (iv) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. (f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines, in its good faith discretion, that it has received a refund or credit of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund or credit (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund or credit), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund or credit), provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer is required to repay such refund or credit to such Governmental Authority. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 3.02 ILLEGALITY. If any Lender determines in good faith that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take 41
deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Committed Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until such Lender in good faith notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. 3.03 INABILITY TO DETERMINE RATES. If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan, or (c) the Eurodollar Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein. 3.04 INCREASED COSTS. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall: (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Eurodollar Rate) or the L/C Issuer; (ii) subject any Lender or the L/C Issuer to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any participation in a Letter of Credit or any Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender or the L/C Issuer in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section 3.01 and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer); or 42
(iii) impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. (b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines in good faith that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company for any such reduction suffered. (c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender or the L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. (d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 43
3.05 COMPENSATION FOR LOSSES. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss (other than loss of Applicable Rate), cost or expense incurred by it as a result of: (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); (b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or (c) any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 10.13; excluding any loss of anticipated profits and including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing. For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Base Rate used in determining the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded. 3.06 MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS; REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS. (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. (b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04 or gives a notice under Section 3.02, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 10.13. 44
3.07 SURVIVAL. All of the Borrower's obligations under this Article III shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations hereunder. ARTICLE IV. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO CREDIT EXTENSIONS 4.01 CONDITIONS OF INITIAL CREDIT EXTENSION. The obligation of the L/C Issuer and each Lender to make its initial Credit Extension hereunder is subject to satisfaction of the following conditions precedent: (a) The Administrative Agent's receipt of the following, each of which shall be originals or telecopies (followed promptly by originals) unless otherwise specified, each properly executed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower, each dated the Closing Date (or, in the case of certificates of governmental officials, a recent date before the Closing Date) and each in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders: (i) executed counterparts of this Agreement, sufficient in number for distribution to the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Borrower; (ii) a Note executed by the Borrower in favor of each Lender requesting a Note; (iii) such certificates of resolutions or other action, incumbency certificates and/or other certificates of Responsible Officers of the Borrower as the Administrative Agent may reasonably require evidencing the identity, authority and capacity of each Responsible Officer thereof authorized to act as a Responsible Officer in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the Borrower is a party; (iv) such documents and certifications as the Administrative Agent may reasonably require to evidence that the Borrower is duly organized or formed, and that the Borrower is validly existing, in good standing and qualified to engage in business in the jurisdiction of its organization; (v) a favorable opinion of Ropes & Gray LLP, counsel to the Borrower, addressed to the Administrative Agent and each Lender, as to the matters set forth in Exhibit F and such other matters concerning the Borrower and the Loan Documents as the Required Lenders may reasonably request; (vi) a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower either (A) attaching copies of all material consents, licenses and approvals required in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower and the validity against the Borrower of the Loan Documents to which it is a party, and such consents, licenses and approvals shall be in full force and effect, or (B) stating that no such consents, licenses or approvals are so required; (vii) a certificate signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower certifying (A) that the conditions specified in Sections 4.02(a) and (b) have been satisfied, (B) that 45

except in such instances in which (a) such requirement of Law or order, writ, injunction or decree is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted or (b) the failure to comply therewith, either individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 5.17 SOLVENCY.

The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, and the Borrower shall not have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. 63
9.02 RIGHTS AS A LENDER. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. 9.03 EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS.

The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower, a Lender or the L/C Issuer. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other 64

The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the L/C Issuer unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the L/C Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 9.05 DELEGATION OF DUTIES.

The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. 9.06 RESIGNATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Borrower.

If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and the L/C 65
Issuer directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section.

Each Lender and the L/C Issuer acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. 9.08 NO OTHER DUTIES, ETC.

Furthermore, each Public Lender agrees to cause at least one individual at or on behalf of such Public Lender to at all times have selected the "Private Side Information" or similar designation on the content declaration screen of the Platform in order to enable such Public Lender or its delegate, in accordance with such Public Lender's compliance procedures and applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities Laws, to make reference to Borrower Materials that are not made available through the "Public Side Information" portion of the Platform and that may contain material non-public information with respect to the Borrower or its securities for purposes of United States Federal or state securities laws.

The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer, each Lender and the Related Parties of each of them from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting 69
from the reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower. All telephonic notices to and other telephonic communications with the Administrative Agent may be recorded by the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such recording. 10.03 NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. No failure by any Lender, the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law. 10.04 EXPENSES; INDEMNITY; DAMAGE WAIVER. (a) Costs and Expenses. The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Arrangers, the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent and their respective Affiliates (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent), in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the L/C Issuer in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent and one additional counsel for all Lenders other than the Administrative Agent, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights (A) in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or (B) in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit.

The Borrower shall indemnify each Arranger, the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof), each Syndication Agent, each Lender and the L/C Issuer, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related reasonable expenses (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee), incurred by any Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee by any third party or by the Borrower arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or, in the case of the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof) and its Related Parties only, the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the L/C Issuer to honor a demand for payment 70
under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the Borrower, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or its Related Parties in performing services in connection with this Agreement or (y) result from a claim brought by the Borrower against an Indemnitee for material breach of such Indemnitee's obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if the Borrower has obtained a final and nonappealable judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. (c) Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Borrower for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), the L/C Issuer or any Related Party thereof, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the L/C Issuer or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount, provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or the L/C Issuer in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or L/C Issuer in connection with such capacity. The obligations of the Lenders under this subsection (c) are subject to the provisions of Section 2.12(d). (d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed to such unintended recipients by such Indemnitee through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other than for direct or actual damages resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee as determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. (e) Payments. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than ten Business Days after demand therefor. 71
(f) Survival. The agreements in this Section shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations. 10.05 PAYMENTS SET ASIDE. To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender and the L/C Issuer severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 10.06 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. (a) Successors and Assigns Generally. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section, or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of subsection (f) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. (b) Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including for purposes of this subsection (b), participations in L/C Obligations and in Swing Line Loans) at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions: (i) Minimum Amounts. 72
(A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and (B) in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if "Trade Date" is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a single Eligible Assignee (or to an Eligible Assignee and members of its Assignee Group) will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been met. (ii) Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not apply to the Swing Line Lender's rights and obligations in respect of Swing Line Loans; (iii) Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition: (A) the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default under Section 8.01(a), 8.01(f) or 8.01(g) has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; and (B) the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender; (C) the consent of the L/C Issuer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any assignment that increases the obligation of the assignee to participate in exposure under one or more Letters of Credit (whether or not then outstanding); and 73
(D) the consent of the Swing Line Lender (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any assignment. (iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. (v) No Assignment to Borrower. No such assignment shall be made to the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates or Subsidiaries. (vi) No Assignment to Natural Persons. No such assignment shall be made to a natural person. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, and 10.04 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section. (c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent's Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (d) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and/or obligations under this Agreement 74
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender's participations in L/C Obligations and/or Swing Line Loans) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 10.01 that affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender. (e) Limitations upon Participant Rights. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 3.01(e) as though it were a Lender. (f) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. (g) Electronic Execution of Assignments. The words "execution," "signed," "signature," and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. (h) Resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender after Assignment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time Bank of America 75
assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, Bank of America may, (i) upon 30 days' notice to the Borrower and the Lenders, resign as L/C Issuer and/or (ii) upon 30 days' notice to the Borrower, resign as Swing Line Lender. In the event of any such resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of Bank of America as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be. If Bank of America resigns as L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Committed Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c)). If Bank of America resigns as Swing Line Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Committed Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c). Upon the appointment of a successor L/C Issuer and/or Swing Line Lender, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, and (b) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to Bank of America to effectively assume the obligations of Bank of America with respect to such Letters of Credit. 10.07 TREATMENT OF CERTAIN INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Arrangers, the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agents, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates' respective partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and representatives (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Borrower or (h) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to any Arranger, the Administrative Agent, any Syndication Agent, any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower. For purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective 76
businesses, other than any such information that is available to any Arranger, the Administrative Agent, any Syndication Agent any Lender or the L/C Issuer on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. Each of the Arrangers, the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agents, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer acknowledges that (a) the Information may include material non-public information concerning the Borrower or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information and (c) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities Laws. 10.08 RIGHT OF SETOFF. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender, the L/C Issuer and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender, the L/C Issuer or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or the L/C Issuer shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of the Borrower may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such Lender or the L/C Issuer different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness. The rights of each Lender, the L/C Issuer and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender, the L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. 10.09 INTEREST RATE LIMITATION. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the "Maximum Rate"). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder. 77
10.10 COUNTERPARTS; INTEGRATION; EFFECTIVENESS. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. 10.11 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding. 10.12 SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. 10.13 REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice under Section 3.02, or if any Lender does not consent to a proposed amendment, waiver or other modification of any Loan Agreement requiring consent of all of the Lenders and which is consented to by the Required Lenders, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.06), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that: (a) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 10.06(b); 78
(b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and L/C Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.05) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts); (c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and (d) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 10.14 GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; ETC. (a) GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (b) SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. THE BORROWER IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY SUBMITS, FOR ITSELF AND ITS PROPERTY, TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SITTING IN NEW YORK COUNTY AND OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT OF THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AND ANY APPELLATE COURT FROM ANY THEREOF, IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR FOR RECOGNITION OR ENFORCEMENT OF ANY JUDGMENT, AND EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN SUCH NEW YORK STATE COURT OR, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN SUCH FEDERAL COURT.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Cambridge, MA, July 24, 2007  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB), a global biotechnology leader in the discovery, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of innovative therapies, today reported its second quarter 2007 results.
Second Quarter 2007 Highlights:
 
Page 2 Biogen Idec Reports Second Quarter 2007 Results
"We are quite pleased with our second quarter performance. Fueled by the strong uptake of TYSABRI, we hit a new corporate milestone as our MS franchise exceeded $500 million in quarterly revenue for the first time in Biogen Idec's history. We successfully completed our $3 billion share repurchase while continuing to advance and strengthen our pipeline, particularly with the anticipated addition of the late stage Lixivaptan compound," said James Mullen, Biogen Idec's Chief Executive Officer.
Financial Performance
On a reported basis, calculated in accordance with GAAP, Biogen Idec reported net income of $186 million (or diluted EPS of $0.54) in the second quarter of 2007.
On a non-GAAP basis, Biogen Idec reported net income of $240 million in the second quarter of 2007. Non-GAAP diluted EPS were $0.70 for the second quarter of 2007.
The reconciling items of note between GAAP net income and diluted GAAP EPS and adjusted non-GAAP net income and diluted non-GAAP EPS in the second quarter, as itemized in Table 3 within this press release, were primarily as follows:
Revenue Performance
Revenues from AVONEX, Biogen Idec's therapy for patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), increased 8% in the second quarter to $462 million. U.S. sales increased 3% to $270 million and international sales increased 14% to $192 million.
Revenues for the second quarter 2007 included $231 million from Biogen Idec's joint business arrangement related to RITUXAN, a treatment for certain B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that Biogen Idec co-promotes in the U.S. with Genentech, Inc. All U.S. sales of RITUXAN are recognized by Genentech, and Biogen Idec records its share of the pretax co-promotion profits. U.S. net sales of RITUXAN were $582 million in the second quarter (Q2 2006 were $526 million), as reported by Genentech.
During the second quarter of 2007, Biogen Idec recognized revenue of $48 million related to TYSABRI. This amount is comprised of:
 
Page 3 Biogen Idec Reports Second Quarter 2007 Results
As of mid-July 2007, approximately 14,000 patients are on TYSABRI therapy worldwide in the commercial and clinical trials settings.
Revenue from FUMADERM (fumaric acid esters) in the second quarter of 2007 was $5 million. Biogen Idec did not recognize any revenue in Q1 2007 related to sales of FUMADERM.
Table 4 provides individual product revenues.
Royalties were $23 million and $18 million in the second quarter 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Share Repurchase Program
Biogen Idec did not repurchase any shares in the second quarter 2007 under the 20 million share repurchase program authorized by Biogen Idec's Board of Directors in October 2006.
Financial Guidance
Biogen Idec today increased its guidance for the full year 2007, including:
Full year 2007 GAAP diluted EPS is estimated to be in the range of $1.84 - $1.94 versus $0.63 per share in 2006. This estimate includes the impact of the anticipated Cardiokine deal but excludes any other future acquisitions or transactions. In order to reconcile GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance, we have excluded the following items from our non-GAAP EPS guidance provided above:
 
Page 4 Biogen Idec Reports Second Quarter 2007 Results
Because the Company cannot predict with certainty the nature or the amount of non-operating or unusual charges for 2007, we have made no assumption regarding future purchase accounting charges in this GAAP guidance. The Company may incur charges or realize income in 2007 which could cause actual results to vary from this guidance.
Recent Highlights
 
Page 5 Biogen Idec Reports Second Quarter 2007 Results
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our "non-GAAP net income" and "non-GAAP diluted EPS" financial measures are defined as reported, or GAAP, net income and diluted EPS excluding, for the reasons discussed below, (1) purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments, (2) stock option expense and the cumulative effect of an accounting change relating to the initial adoption of SFAS No. 123R and (3) other items. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to establish financial goals and to gain an understanding of the comparative financial performance of the Company from year to year and quarter to quarter. Accordingly, we believe investors' understanding of the Company's financial performance is enhanced as a result of our disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income and diluted EPS.
Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments  Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS exclude certain purchase accounting impacts such as those related to the merger with Biogen, Inc. (the "Merger") and the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, Conforma Therapeutics Corporation and Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. These include charges for in process research and development and the incremental charge to cost of goods sold from our sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value at the acquisition date. Additionally, these excluded impacts include the incremental charges related to the amortization of the acquired intangible assets. Excluding these charges allows management and investors an alternative view of our financial results "as if" the acquired intangible asset had been developed internally rather than acquired and, therefore, provides a supplemental measure of performance in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
Stock option expense and the cumulative effect of an accounting change relating to the initial adoption of SFAS No. 123R  Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS exclude the impact of
 
Page 6 Biogen Idec Reports Second Quarter 2007 Results
our stock option expense recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 123R and the cumulative effect of an accounting change relating to its initial adoption. We believe that excluding the impact of expensing stock options better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our integrated business. We do include the P&L impact of restricted stock awards and other cash incentives in our non-GAAP results.
Other items  Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS exclude other unusual or non-recurring items that are evaluated on an individual basis. Our evaluation of whether to exclude an item for purposes of determining our non-GAAP financial measures considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including, among other things (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. Items excluded for purposes of determining non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS are severance and restructuring charges and a gain on sale of long-lived assets.
The Company has reconciled the GAAP net income and diluted EPS for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 to the non-GAAP measures of net income and diluted EPS in Table 3 of this press release.
Conference Call and Webcast
The Company's earnings conference call for the second quarter will be broadcast via the internet at 8:30 a.m. ET onJuly 24, 2007, and will be accessible through the investor relations section of Biogen Idec's homepage, . Supplemental information in the form of a slide presentation will also be accessible at the same location on the internet at the time of the earnings conference call, and will remain on the Biogen Idec website through at least August 31, 2007.

INVESTOR CONTACTS:
 In presentations to investors today and over the next week, Biogen Idec (NASDAQ: BIIB) CEO James C. Mullen will outline key growth opportunities and review the company's long-range strategic and financial goals. Mullen is scheduled to speak at the Thomas Weisel Partners Healthcare Conference at 8 a.m. today in Boston and the Bear Stearns Healthcare Conference on Sept. 10 in New York. Both presentations will be available via webcast on the Investor Relations section of . Supplemental information in the form of a slide presentation will also be accessible on the internet at the same location at the time of each presentation and will remain on the Biogen Idec website until at least September 30, 2007.
Cambridge, MA, September 6, 2007
www.biogenidec.com
Biogen Idec will announce its goal to generate revenue growth at a 15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and non-GAAP EPS at a 20% CAGR from 2007 through 2010.
Financial Goals
These financial goals reflect the strong growth momentum already underway at Biogen Idec. Specifically, the company expects its growth to be driven by:
 
Page 2    Biogen Idec Announces Strategic Updates at Investor Meetings
"Now that Biogen Idec is more than a year into the reintroduction of TYSABRI in the U.S., and we have launched and gained reimbursement for this important therapy in the major European markets, we are providing greater detail regarding our goals for long-range growth," Mullen said. "Over the near- to mid-term, we expect to see continued strong performances by AVONEX and RITUXAN as well as the emergence of TYSABRI as the world's leading therapy for patients with multiple sclerosis."
The company has 15 product candidates in Phase 2 clinical trials or beyond with more than 10 data readouts expected by the end of 2008. These programs are expected to contribute to similar top-line growth over the longer term. By 2010, the company's goal is to have four new products and/or existing products launched in new indications as well as six programs in late-stage clinical development.
Pipeline Highlights
"Our growth goals reflect the contribution of our robust pipeline," Mullen said. "Over the past two years, we've successfully advanced multiple internal programs. At the same time, we've pursued a business development strategy that has allowed us to access more than 10 molecules for less than $640 million in upfront payments. We plan to continue growing our core therapeutic areas while expanding into new areas with a focus on first-in-class and best-in-class products."
As part of the presentation, Mullen will discuss several promising programs: lumiliximab for chronic lymphocytic leukemia; RITUXAN for lupus; LTR-Fc for rheumatoid arthritis; long acting factor IX for hemophilia B; and HSP90 inhibition for blood and solid cancers.
b
Mullen will reiterate guidance for the full-year 2007. On July 24, in reporting its second-quarter financial results, the company increased the full-year guidance to:
2007 Financial Guidance Reiterated
 
Page 3    Biogen Idec Announces Strategic Updates at Investor Meetings
Because the company cannot predict with certainty the nature or the amount of non-operating or unusual charges for 2007, we have made no assumption regarding future purchase accounting charges in this GAAP guidance. The company may incur charges or realize income in 2007 which could cause actual results to vary from this guidance.
At the time of the merger in 2003, the company forecast 15% CAGR in revenue and 20% CAGR in non-GAAP EPS though the end of 2007. Achievement of this full-year 2007 guidance would enable the company to fulfill those financial goals by generating 14% CAGR in revenue and 21% CAGR in non-GAAP EPS though the end of 2007.
On a reported basis, calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP), the company aims to grow GAAP EPS from 2007 through 2010 at a 25% CAGR. The long-term non-GAAP EPS goal excludes the impact of purchase accounting, merger-related adjustments, stock option expense, and their related tax effects. In order to reconcile long-term GAAP and non-GAAP EPS figures, the company has excluded the following items for 2008 through 2010 from our non-GAAP EPS goal provided above:
GAAP EPS Reconciliation
Because the company cannot predict with certainty the nature or the amount of non-operating or unusual charges through 2010, it has made no assumption regarding new purchase accounting charges in this GAAP EPS goal. The company may incur charges or realize income through 2010 which could cause actual results to vary from the goal.
"Non-GAAP EPS" financial measures are defined as reported, or GAAP, EPS excluding, for the reasons discussed below, (1) purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments, (2) stock option expense and (3) other items. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to establish financial goals and gain an understanding of the comparative financial performance of the company from year to year and quarter to quarter. Accordingly, Biogen Idec believes investors' understanding of the company's financial performance is enhanced as a result of our disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, EPS.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments  Non-GAAP EPS exclude certain purchase accounting impacts such as those related to the merger with Biogen, Inc. (the "Merger") and the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, Conforma Therapeutics Corp. and Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. These include charges for in process research and development and the incremental charge to cost of goods sold from the company's sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value at the acquisition date.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Cambridge, MA, October 23, 2007  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB), a global biotechnology leader in the discovery, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of innovative therapies, today reported its third quarter 2007 results.
Third Quarter 2007 Highlights:
 
Page 2 Biogen Idec Reports Third Quarter 2007 Results
"The year is unfolding as planned, and we are well on track to hitting the 2007 financial guidance that we revised upward this summer," said James Mullen, Biogen Idec's Chief Executive Officer.
Financial Performance
On a reported basis, calculated in accordance with GAAP, Biogen Idec reported net income of $119 million (or diluted EPS of $0.41) in the third quarter of 2007. On a non-GAAP basis, Biogen Idec reported net income of $170 million in the third quarter of 2007. Non-GAAP diluted EPS were $0.58 for the third quarter of 2007. Both the GAAP and non-GAAP earnings figures for the third quarter 2007 include a $50 million, or $0.11 diluted EPS, R&D expense due to an upfront license payment to Cardiokine.
The reconciling items of note between GAAP net income and diluted GAAP EPS and non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS in the third quarter, as itemized in Table 3 within this press release, were primarily as follows:
Revenue Performance
Revenues from AVONEX, the world's most prescribed therapy for patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), increased 2% in the third quarter to $455 million as compared with the prior year quarter. U.S. sales were $266 million and international sales increased 7% to $189 million.
Revenues for the third quarter 2007 included $235 million from Biogen Idec's joint business arrangement related to RITUXAN, a treatment for certain B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that Biogen Idec co-promotes in the U.S. with Genentech Inc. All U.S. sales of RITUXAN are recognized by Genentech, and Biogen Idec records its share of the pretax co-promotion profits. U.S. net sales of RITUXAN were $572 million in the third quarter (Q3 2006 were $509 million), as reported by Genentech.
During the third quarter of 2007, Biogen Idec recognized revenue of $63 million related to TYSABRI. This amount is comprised of:
As of the end of September 2007, approximately 17,000 patients are on TYSABRI therapy worldwide in the commercial and clinical trials settings.
 
Page 3 Biogen Idec Reports Third Quarter 2007 Results
Revenue from FUMADERM (fumaric acid esters) in the third quarter of 2007 was $7 million. Biogen Idec recognized $5 million in sales of FUMADERM in Q2 2007. Table 4 provides individual product revenues.
Royalty revenues were $24 million and $22 million in the third quarter 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Share Repurchase Program
Biogen Idec did not repurchase any shares in the third quarter 2007 under the 20 million share repurchase program authorized by Biogen Idec's Board of Directors in October 2006.
Financial Guidance
Biogen Idec today reiterated its guidance for the full year 2007, including:
Full year 2007 GAAP diluted EPS is estimated to be in the range of $1.84-$1.94 versus $0.63 per share in 2006. This estimate excludes future acquisitions or transactions. In order to reconcile GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance, we have excluded the following items from our non-GAAP EPS guidance provided above:
Because the Company cannot predict with certainty the nature or the amount of non-operating or unusual charges for 2007, we have made no assumption regarding future purchase accounting
 
Page 4 Biogen Idec Reports Third Quarter 2007 Results
charges in this GAAP guidance. The Company may incur charges or realize income in 2007 that could cause actual results to vary from this guidance.
Recent Highlights
 
Page 5 Biogen Idec Reports Third Quarter 2007 Results
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our "non-GAAP net income" and "non-GAAP diluted EPS" financial measures are defined as reported, or GAAP, net income and diluted EPS excluding, for the reasons discussed below, (1) purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments, (2) stock option expense and the
 
Page 6 Biogen Idec Reports Third Quarter 2007 Results
cumulative effect of an accounting change relating to the initial adoption of SFAS No. 123R and (3) other items. We believe it is important to share these non-GAAP financial measures with shareholders as they: better represent the ongoing economics of the business, reflect how we manage the business internally and set operational goals, and form the basis of our management incentive programs. Accordingly, we believe investors' understanding of the Company's financial performance is enhanced as a result of our disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income and diluted EPS.
Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments  Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS exclude certain purchase accounting impacts such as those related to the merger with Biogen, Inc. (the "Merger"), the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, Conforma Therapeutics and Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, and the consolidation of Cardiokine. These include charges for in process research and development and the incremental charge to cost of goods sold from our sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value at the acquisition date. Also excluded are the incremental charges related to the amortization of the acquired intangible assets. Excluding these charges allows management and investors an alternative view of our financial results "as if" the acquired intangible asset had been developed internally rather than acquired and, therefore, provides a supplemental measure of performance in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
Stock option expense and the cumulative effect of an accounting change relating to the initial adoption of SFAS No. 123R  Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS exclude the impact of our stock option expense recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 123R and the cumulative effect of an accounting change relating to its initial adoption. We believe that excluding the impact of expensing stock options better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our integrated business. We do include the P&L impact of restricted stock awards and other cash incentives in our non-GAAP results.
Other items  Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS exclude other unusual or non-recurring items that are evaluated on an individual basis. Our evaluation of whether to exclude an item for purposes of determining our non-GAAP financial measures considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including, among other things (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. Items excluded for purposes of determining non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS are restructuring charges, a gain on sale of long-lived assets, the gain on settlement of license agreements with Fumapharm AG, and the tax effects of these adjustments.
The Company has reconciled the GAAP net income and diluted EPS for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 to the non-GAAP measures of net income and diluted EPS in Table 3 of this press release.

Supplemental information in the form of a slide presentation will also be accessible on the Biogen Idec website at the time of the presentation and will remain available until at least February 6, 2008.
San Francisco, CA, January 7, 2008

2010 Product and Financial Goals
Mullen will reiterate Biogen Idec's 2010 business goals, including:
"Biogen Idec has extremely strong growth prospects," Mullen said. "The continued strength of AVONEX, the expansion of RITUXAN and the emergence of TYSABRI as the world's leading multiple sclerosis therapy will drive substantial top- and bottom-line growth in 2008 and beyond."
TYSABRI Update
Biogen Idec, in collaboration with partner Elan Corporation, plc (NYSE: ELN), today also announced new data on the global utilization, safety and overall patient exposure of TYSABRI. As of late December 2007, more than 21,000 patients were on commercial and clinical therapy worldwide. To date, the safety data continue to support a favorable benefit-risk profile for TYSABRI.
According to data available to the companies as of late December 2007:
 
In addition, as of mid-December 2007:
Pipeline Highlights
Mullen will provide an update on Biogen Idec's 15 product candidates in Phase 2 clinical trials or beyond, as well as the 10 or more data readouts expected between September 2007 and year-end 2008. These programs are expected to contribute to significant top-line growth over the longer term. As previously announced, by 2010 the company's goal is to have four new products and/or existing products launched in new indications as well as six programs in late-stage clinical development.
"We've successfully advanced multiple internal programs over the past two years and, at the same time, pursued a successful business development strategy to expand the pipeline," Mullen said. "We now have one of the most robust pipelines in the industry, and we plan to continue growing our core therapeutic areas while expanding into new areas with a focus on first-in-class and best-in-class products."
2007 and 2008 Financial Guidance
Biogen Idec revised upward full-year 2007 financial guidance on July 24 when the company reported its second-quarter financial results, and reiterated that guidance on December 12. Biogen Idec now expects that full-year 2007 GAAP EPS and non-GAAP EPS will be above the top end of the previously indicated ranges. The Company expects to report full year results in the first half of February.
In addition, given the strong growth momentum Biogen Idec is experiencing, Mullen will issue the following full-year 2008 guidance, consistent with achieving the company's business plan:
 
Because the Company cannot predict with certainty the nature or the amount of other non-operating or unusual charges for 2008, we have made no assumption regarding such charges in this GAAP guidance. The Company may incur charges or realize income in 2008 that could cause actual results to vary from this guidance.
GAAP EPS Reconciliation for 2010 Goals
On a reported basis, calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the US (GAAP), the Company aims to grow GAAP EPS from 2007 through 2010 at a 25% CAGR. The long-term non-GAAP EPS goal excludes the impact of purchase accounting, merger-related adjustments, stock option expense and their related tax effects. In order to reconcile long-term GAAP and non-GAAP EPS figures, the Company has excluded the following items for the years 2008 through 2010 from our non-GAAP EPS goal provided above:
Because the Company cannot predict with certainty the nature or the amount of non-operating or unusual charges through 2010, it has made no assumption regarding other such charges in this GAAP EPS goal. The Company may incur charges or realize income through 2010 that could cause actual results to vary from the goal.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our "non-GAAP EPS" financial measure is defined as reported, or GAAP, EPS excluding, for the reasons discussed below, (1) purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments, (2) stock option expense and (3) other items. We believe it is important to share these non-GAAP financial measures with shareholders as they: better represent the ongoing economics of the business, reflect how we manage the business internally and set operational goals, and form the basis of our management incentive programs. Accordingly, we believe investors' understanding of the Company's financial performance is enhanced as a result of our disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP EPS should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, EPS.
Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments  Non-GAAP EPS excludes certain purchase accounting impacts such as those related to the merger with Biogen, Inc. (the "Merger") and the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, Conforma Therapeutics and Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, and the consolidation of CardioKine. These charges relate to in-process research and development charges incurred upon the payment of future milestones and incremental charges related to the amortization of the acquired intangible assets. Excluding these charges allows management and investors an alternative view of our financial results "as if" the acquired intangible asset had been
 
developed internally rather than acquired and, therefore, provides a supplemental measure of performance in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
Stock option expense  Non-GAAP EPS excludes the impact of our stock option expense recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. We believe that excluding the impact of expensing stock options better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our integrated business. We do include the P&L impact of restricted stock awards and cash incentives in our non-GAAP results.
Other items  Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS exclude other unusual or non-recurring items that are evaluated on an individual basis. Our evaluation of whether to exclude an item for purposes of determining our non-GAAP financial measures considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including, among other things (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. For purposes of determining non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS, restructuring charges and the related tax effect are excluded.
About TOUCH and TYGRIS
Before initiating treatment, all US patients, prescribers and infusion sites must be enrolled in the TOUCH Prescribing Program (TYSABRI Outreach: Unified Commitment to Health). TOUCH is designed to determine the incidence of and risk factors for serious opportunistic infections (OIs), including PML, and to monitor patients for signs and symptoms of PML while promoting informed benefit-risk discussions prior to initiating TYSABRI treatment. Physicians report on PML, other serious OIs, deaths and discontinuation of therapy on an ongoing basis.
TYGRIS (TYSABRI Global ObseRvation Program In Safety) is expected to enroll 5,000 patients worldwide, including approximately 3,000 patients from TOUCH. Patients in TYGRIS are evaluated at baseline and every six months thereafter for five years. Researchers will evaluate data including medical/MS history; prior TYSABRI use; prior use of immunomodulatory, antineoplastic or immunosuppressive agents; and all serious adverse events, including PML, other serious OIs and malignancies.
Adverse event reporting in the post-marketing setting is voluntary. It is possible that not all reactions have been reported, or that some reactions are not reported to Biogen Idec or Elan in a timely manner.
About TYSABRI
TYSABRI is a treatment approved for relapsing forms of MS in the United States and relapsing-remitting MS in the European Union. According to data that have been published in the New England Journal of Medicine, after two years, TYSABRI treatment led to a 68% relative reduction (p<0.001) in the annualized relapse rate compared to placebo and reduced the relative risk of disability progression by 42-54% (p<0.001).
TYSABRI increases the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an opportunistic viral infection of the brain that usually leads to death or severe disability. Other serious adverse events that have occurred in TYSABRI-treated patients include hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) and infections. Serious opportunistic and other atypical infections have been observed in TYSABRI-treated patients, some of
 
whom were receiving concurrent immunosuppressants. Herpes infections were slightly more common in patients treated with TYSABRI. In MS trials, the incidence and rate of other serious and common adverse events, including the overall incidence and rate of infections, were balanced between treatment groups. Common adverse events reported in TYSABRI-treated patients include headache, fatigue, infusion reactions, urinary tract infections, joint and limb pain, and rash.
In addition to the United States and European Union, TYSABRI is also approved for MS in Switzerland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Israel. TYSABRI was discovered by Elan and is co-developed with Biogen Idec.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Cambridge, MA, February 6, 2008  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB), a global biotechnology leader in the discovery, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of innovative therapies, today reported its full year and fourth quarter 2007 results.
Full Year 2007 Highlights:
 
Page 2 Biogen Idec Reports Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2007 Results
James Mullen, Biogen Idec's Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We're extremely proud of our accomplishments in 2007. We grew revenues by 18% and non-GAAP earnings per share by 22%; we delivered on our four-year growth targets; and we advanced and expanded our pipeline. We're confident 2008 will be another year of strong financial performance and many meaningful clinical data readouts."
Fourth Quarter 2007 Highlights:
Financial Performance
On a non-GAAP basis, Biogen Idec reported net income of $266 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 and $879 million for the full year 2007. Non-GAAP diluted EPS were $0.89 for the fourth quarter of 2007 and $2.74 for the full year 2007.
On a reported basis, calculated in accordance with GAAP, Biogen Idec reported net income of $201 million (or diluted EPS of $0.67) in the fourth quarter of 2007 and net income of $638 million (or diluted EPS of $1.99) for the full year 2007. The reconciling items between GAAP net income and diluted GAAP EPS and adjusted non-GAAP net income and diluted non-GAAP EPS in the fourth quarter, as itemized in Table 3 within this press release, were primarily as follows:
 
Page 3 Biogen Idec Reports Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2007 Results
Revenue Performance
Revenues from AVONEX, the worldwide leading therapy for patients with relapsing forms of MS, increased 15% in the fourth quarter to $503 million. Full year AVONEX sales increased 9% to $1.87 billion. In 2007, U.S. sales increased 6% to $1.09 billion and international sales increased 14% to $783 million.
Revenues for the fourth quarter and full year 2007 included $254 million and $926 million, respectively, from Biogen Idec's joint business arrangement related to RITUXAN, a treatment for certain B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that Biogen Idec co-promotes in the U.S. with Genentech, Inc. All U.S. sales of RITUXAN are recognized by Genentech, and Biogen Idec records its share of the pretax co-promotion profits. U.S. net sales of RITUXAN were $596 million in the fourth quarter (Q4 2006: $560 million) and $2.29 billion for the full year (2006: $2.07 billion), as reported by Genentech.
During the fourth quarter of 2007, Biogen Idec recognized revenue of $90 million related to TYSABRI. This amount is comprised of:
As of late December 2007, more than 21,000 patients were on commercial and clinical TYSABRI therapy worldwide. To date, the safety data continues to support a favorable benefit-risk profile for TYSABRI. According to data available as of late December 2007:
Revenues from other products in the fourth quarter of 2007 were $12 million (Q4 2006: $7 million). Current revenues now include FUMADERM (fumaric acid esters) obtained in connection with the Fumapharm acquisition and also ZEVALIN (ibritumomab tiuxetan), which was recently sold to Cell Therapeutics.
Table 4 provides individual product revenues.
 
Page 4 Biogen Idec Reports Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2007 Results
Royalties were $33 million in the fourth quarter and $102 million for the full year 2007.
Financial Guidance
Following its strong performance in 2007, Biogen Idec reiterated its 2008 financial guidance which is consistent with achieving the company's long term business plan:
Since the Company cannot predict with certainty the nature or the amount of non-operating or unusual charges for 2008, we have made no assumptions regarding other such charges in this GAAP guidance. The Company may incur charges or realize gains in 2008 that could cause actual results to vary from this guidance.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our "non-GAAP net income" and "non-GAAP diluted EPS" financial measures are defined as reported, or GAAP, net income and diluted EPS excluding, for the reasons discussed below, (1) purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments, (2) stock option expense and the cumulative effect of an accounting change relating to the initial adoption of SFAS 123R and (3) other items. We believe it is important to share these non-GAAP financial measures with shareholders as they: better represent the ongoing
 
Page 7 Biogen Idec Reports Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2007 Results
economics of the business, reflect how we manage the business internally and set operational goals, and form the basis of our management incentive programs. Accordingly, we believe investors' understanding of the Company's financial performance is enhanced as a result of our disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income and diluted EPS.
Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments  Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS exclude certain purchase accounting impacts such as those related to the merger with Biogen, Inc. (the "Merger"), the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, Conforma Therapeutics and Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, and the consolidation of Cardiokine, Neurimmune, and Escoublac. These include charges for in process research and development and the incremental charge to cost of goods sold from our sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value at the acquisition date. Also excluded are the incremental charges related to the amortization of the acquired intangible assets. Excluding these charges allows management and investors an alternative view of our financial results "as if" the acquired intangible asset had been developed internally rather than acquired and, therefore, provides a supplemental measure of performance in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
Stock option expense and the cumulative effect of an accounting change relating to the initial adoption of SFAS 123R  Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS exclude the impact of our stock option expense recorded in accordance with SFAS 123R and the cumulative effect of an accounting change relating to its initial adoption. We believe that excluding the impact of expensing stock options better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our integrated business. We do include the P&L impact of restricted stock awards and cash incentives in our non-GAAP results.
Other items  Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS exclude other unusual or non-recurring items that are evaluated on an individual basis. Our evaluation of whether to exclude an item for purposes of determining our non-GAAP financial measures considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including, among other things (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. Items excluded for purposes of determining non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS are restructuring charges, a net gain on sale of long-lived assets and impairments, the gain/loss on settlement of license agreements with Fumedica and Fumapharm AG, and the tax effects of these adjustments.
The Company has reconciled the GAAP net income and diluted EPS for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 to the non-GAAP measures of net income and diluted EPS in Table 3 of this press release.
Conference Call and Webcast
The Company's earnings conference call for the fourth quarter will be broadcast via the internet at 8:30 a.m. ET on February 6, 2008, and will be accessible through the investor

     On February 12, 2008, the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors of Biogen Idec Inc. approved a retention bonus program that includes all of the executive officers of the Company, other than Mr. Mullen. Under the program, which is separate from the annual cash incentive plan, each executive officer has a target bonus opportunity equal to 100% of annual base salary. Payment of the bonus would be based on achievement of the Company's annual cash incentive plan target goals for 2008 revenue and earnings per share, with each goal weighted 50%. Depending on the Company's performance against those goals, payments can range from 0% to 150% of the target bonus opportunity.
     The retention bonuses would be paid in March 2009 and the executive would have to be continuously employed by Biogen Idec through the payment date in order to receive the payment, unless before March 2009 Biogen Idec undergoes a corporate change in control or a corporate transaction and the executive undergoes an involuntary employment action, in which case the executive would be entitled to receive upon termination the target bonus if termination occurs on or prior to December 31, 2008 or the earned bonus if termination occurs after December 31, 2008. The terms corporate change in control, corporate transaction and involuntary employment action are defined in the 2005 Biogen Idec Inc. Omnibus Equity Plan.

(the "Registrant") and its TYSABRI collaboration partner, Elan Corporation plc ("Elan") have issued a letter to healthcare professionals describing these risks.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
February 2008
Dear Healthcare Professional,
Biogen Idec and Elan are writing to inform you of new safety information regarding TYSABRI (natalizumab). The full Prescribing Information has been revised to add to the Warnings and Precautions section information related to clinically significant liver injury that has been reported in patients treated with TYSABRI in the post-marketing setting.
The following Warning has been added to the Prescribing Information:
   
5
Warnings and Precautions
5.5 Hepatotoxicity
Clinically significant liver injury has been reported in patients treated with TYSABRI in the postmarketing setting. Signs of liver injury, including markedly elevated serum hepatic enzymes and elevated total bilirubin, occurred as early as six days after the first dose; signs of liver injury have also been reported for the first time after multiple doses. In some patients, liver injury recurred upon rechallenge, providing evidence that TYSABRI caused the injury. The combination of transaminase elevations and elevated bilirubin without evidence of obstruction is generally recognized as an important predictor of severe liver injury that may lead to death or the need for a liver transplant in some patients.
TYSABRI should be discontinued in patients with jaundice or other evidence of significant liver injury (e.g., laboratory evidence).
Additionally, the Patient Counseling section has been updated to instruct physicians to inform their patients that TYSABRI may cause liver injury.
 
Patients should be instructed to read the Medication Guide for symptoms of liver damage.
17. PATIENT COUSELING INFORMATION
17.5 Hepatotoxicity
Inform patients that TYSABRI may cause liver injury. Instruct the patient to contract their doctor if they develop symptoms of hepatoxicity [see ].
Warnings and Precautions (5.5)
At Biogen and Elan, patient safety is our highest priority and we are committed to ensuring that healthcare professionals continue to receive the necessary information to prescribe TYSABRI appropriately.
As reminder, healthcare professionals should report any serious adverse events possibly associated with the use of TYSABRI to Biogen Idec at 1-800-456-2255. This information may also be reported to FDA's MedWatch reporting system by phone (1-800-FDA-1088), FAX (1-800-FDA-0178), via the MedWatch website at www.fda.gov/medwatch, or by mail to MedWatch, HF-2, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20852-9787.
The revised full Prescribing Information and Medication Guide are enclosed. The labeling has been reformatted to comply with the new (commonly referred to as the Physicians Labeling Rule).
Requirements on Content and Format of Labeling for Human Drug and Biologic Products
Should you have questions regarding the use of TYSABRI or have questions regarding the TOUCH Prescribing Program for TYSABRI, call 1-800-456-2255.
Sincerely,

     (d) On the date of the Prospectus at a time prior to the execution of this Agreement, at 9:30 a.m., New York City time, on the effective date of any post effective amendment to the Registration Statement filed subsequent to the date of this Agreement and also at the Time of Delivery, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to you a letter or letters, dated the respective dates of delivery thereof, in form and substance satisfactory to you, containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to financial statements and certain financial information contained in the Registration Statement, Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus. The letter to be delivered on the effective date of any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement, and as of the Time of Delivery shall reaffirm the statements made in the letter furnished on the date of the Prospectus, except that statements made therein as of a specified date subsequent to the date of the latest balance sheet and income statement of the Company shall be as of a date not more than three business days prior to the date of such post-effective amendment or Time of Delivery, as applicable;
     (e) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus,
 
and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Pricing Prospectus there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries (other than changes due to grants, exercises, and terminations under Company incentive plans referred to in the Pricing Prospectus and in the documents incorporated by reference therein, repurchases of the Company's common stock pursuant to an issuer tender offer completed on July 2, 2007 as set forth in the Pricing Prospectus and in the documents incorporated by reference therein and other publicly announced share repurchase programs), otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in your judgment so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus;
     (f) On or after the Applicable Time (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities;
     (g) On or after the Applicable Time there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Global Select Market; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the NASDAQ Global Select Market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or (v) the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in your judgment makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus;
     (h) The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(e) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses on the New York Business Day next succeeding the date of this Agreement; and

     9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any reasonable legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein.
     (b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made
 
in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein and will reimburse the Company for any reasonable legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the
 
Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
     (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any
 
Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
     10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right
 
described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
     12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein other than as a result of a failure of the conditions set forth in paragraph (g) of Section 8, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out of pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
     13. In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by you jointly or by Goldman, Sachs & Co. on behalf of you as the representatives.
     All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to you as the representatives in care of Goldman, Sachs & Co., 85 Broad Street, 20 Floor, New York, New York 10004, Attention: Registration Department; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by you upon request. Any such
th
 
statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
     In accordance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the underwriters are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their respective clients, including the Company, which information may include the name and address of their respective clients, as well as other information that will allow the underwriters to properly identify their respective clients.
     14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
     15. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
     16. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
     17. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
     18.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
 
     19. The Company and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
     20. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
     21. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company is authorized to disclose to any persons the U.S. federal and state income tax treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Company relating to that treatment and structure, without the Underwriters, imposing any limitation of any kind. However, any information relating to the tax treatment and tax structure shall remain confidential (and the foregoing sentence shall not apply) to the extent necessary to enable any person to comply with securities laws. For this purpose, "tax structure" is limited to any facts that may be relevant to that treatment.
 
     If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us six counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by you, on behalf of each of the Underwriters, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between each of the Underwriters and the Company. It is understood that your acceptance of this letter on behalf of each of the Underwriters is pursuant to the authority set forth in a form of Agreement among Underwriters, the form of which shall be submitted to the Company for examination upon request.

Principal Amount
.
     (c) The entire outstanding principal of the Notes due 2013 shall be payable on March 1, 2013, and the entire outstanding principal of the Notes due 2018 shall be payable on March 1, 2018.

.
 
whose names the Notes (or one or more predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be February 15 or August 15, as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Any such interest not punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the respective Holders on such Regular Record Date, and such defaulted interest, may be paid to the Persons in whose names the Notes (or one or more predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a special record date for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Notes not less than 15 days prior to such special record date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.

provided
however
     (ii) The interest rate payable on the Notes of each series shall be subject to adjustment from time to time if either Moody's or S&P downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating assigned to the Notes in the manner described below.
     If the rating from Moody's of the Notes of a series is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate payable on the Notes of such series will increase from the interest rate payable on the Notes of such series on the date of their issuance by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
     If the rating from S&P of the Notes of a series is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate payable on the Notes of such series will increase from the interest rate payable on the Notes of such series on the date of their issuance by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
 
     If at any time the interest rate payable on the Notes of a series has been adjusted upward and either Moody's or S&P, as the case may be, subsequently increases its rating of the Notes of that series to any of the threshold ratings set forth above, the interest rate payable on the Notes of such series will be decreased such that the interest rate payable on the Notes of such series equals the interest rate payable on the Notes of such series on the date of their issuance plus the percentages set forth opposite the ratings from the tables above in effect immediately following the increase. If Moody's subsequently increases its rating of the Notes of a series to Baa3 or higher and S&P increases its rating to BBB- or higher the interest rate payable on the Notes of such series will be decreased to the interest rate payable on the Notes of such series on the date of their issuance. In addition, the interest rates on the Notes of each series shall permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by either or both rating agencies) if the Notes of such series become rated Baa1 and A- or higher by Moody's and S&P, respectively (or one of these ratings if only rated by one rating agency).
     Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's or S&P, shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the interest rate payable on the Notes of a series be reduced to below the interest rate payable on the Notes of such series on the date of their issuance or (2) the total increase in the interest rate payable on the Notes of a series exceed 2.00% above the interest rate payable on the Notes of such series on the date of their issuance.
     If either Moody's or S&P ceases to provide a rating of the Notes of a series, any subsequent increase or decrease in the interest rate payable on the Notes of such series necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by the agency continuing to provide the rating shall be twice the percentage set forth in the applicable table above. No adjustments in the interest rate payable on the Notes of either series shall be made solely as a result of either Moody's or S&P ceasing to provide a rating. If both Moody's and S&P cease to provide a rating of the Notes of a series, the interest rate payable on the Notes of such series will increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the interest rate payable on the Notes of such series on the date of their issuance.
     Any interest rate increase or decrease described above will take effect from the first day of the interest period during which a rating change requires an adjustment in the interest rate.
     If the interest rate payable on the Notes of a series is increased as described in this Section 2.2(d)(ii), then the term "interest," as used in this First Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture and the Notes of the applicable series, will be deemed to include any such additional interest unless the context otherwise requires.
          (e) . The currency of denomination of the Notes is United States Dollars. Payment of principal of and interest and premium, if any, on the Notes will be made in United States Dollars.
Currency
 
     SECTION 2.3. .

     (b) At any time and from time to time, the Notes of each series will be redeemable, as a whole or in part, at the Company's option, on at least 30 days, but not more than 60 days, prior notice mailed to the registered address of each holder of the Notes of the applicable series, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest and principal thereon (exclusive of interest accrued and unpaid to, but not including, the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis, assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at the Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of redemption.
     (c) On and after the Redemption Date for the Notes of either series, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes of such series or any portion thereof called for redemption, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price. On or before the Redemption Date for the Notes of such series, the Company will deposit with a Paying Agent, or the Trustee, funds sufficient to pay the redemption price of the Notes to be redeemed on such date. If less than all of the Notes of a series are to be redeemed, the Notes of that series to be redeemed will be selected by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate.
     SECTION 2.4. .
Repurchase of Notes Upon a Change of Control

In the Change of Control Offer, the Company shall offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased to but not including the date of repurchase (the "Change of Control Payment").

The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to
 
purchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.

     (c) The Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party repurchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company shall not repurchase any Notes if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than an Event of Default arising as a result of a default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
     (d) The Company shall comply in all material respects with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes by virtue of any such conflict.

On a reported basis, calculated in accordance with GAAP, Biogen Idec reported net income of $163 million (or diluted EPS of $0.54) in the first quarter of 2008.
On a non-GAAP basis, Biogen Idec reported net income of $250 million in the first quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP diluted EPS were $0.83 for the first quarter of 2008.
The reconciling items between GAAP net income and GAAP diluted EPS and non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS in the first quarter, as itemized in Table 3 within this press release, were primarily as follows:
Revenue Performance
Revenues from AVONEX, one of Biogen Idec's therapies for patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), increased 19% in the first quarter to $536 million. U.S. sales increased 14% to $308 million and international sales increased 27% to $228 million.
Revenues for the first quarter of 2008 included $247 million from Biogen Idec's joint business arrangement related to RITUXAN, a treatment for certain B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that Biogen Idec co-promotes in the U.S. with Genentech, Inc. All U.S. sales of RITUXAN are recognized by Genentech, and Biogen Idec records its share of the pretax co-promotion profits. As reported by Genentech, U.S. net sales of RITUXAN were $605 million in the first quarter, as compared to $535 million in the first quarter of 2007.
During the first quarter of 2008, Biogen Idec recognized revenue of $115 million related to TYSABRI. This amount is comprised of:

As of the end of March 2008, approximately 26,000 patients were on commercial and clinical TYSABRI therapy worldwide. According to data available as of the end of March 2008:
Cumulatively, in the combined clinical trial and post-marketing settings:
Revenues from other products in the first quarter of 2008 were $14 million (compared to Q1 2007: $6 million). Current revenues include sales of FUMADERM (fumaric acid esters) and ZEVALIN (ibritumomab tiuxetan), which was sold to Cell Therapeutics in the fourth quarter of 2007.

Royalties were $24 million and $23 million in the first quarter 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Financial Guidance
Following its strong performance, Biogen Idec raised its 2008 financial guidance:
 
Page 4 Biogen Idec Reports First Quarter 2008 Results
Since the Company cannot predict with certainty the nature or the amount of non-operating or unusual charges for 2008, we have made no assumptions regarding other such charges in this GAAP guidance. The Company may incur charges or realize gains in 2008 that could cause actual results to vary from this guidance.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our "non-GAAP net income" and "non-GAAP diluted EPS" financial measures are defined as reported, or GAAP, net income and diluted EPS excluding, for the reasons discussed below, (1) purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments, (2) stock option expense and (3) other items. We believe it is important to share these non-GAAP financial measures with shareholders as they: better represent the ongoing economics of the business, reflect how we manage the business internally and set operational goals, and form the basis of our management incentive programs. Accordingly, we believe investors' understanding of the Company's financial performance is enhanced as a result of our disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP net income and
 
Page 6 Biogen Idec Reports First Quarter 2008 Results
diluted EPS should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income and diluted EPS.
Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments  Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS exclude certain purchase accounting impacts such as those related to our 2003 merger with Biogen, Inc. (the "Merger"), the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, Conforma Therapeutics and Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, and the consolidation of Cardiokine and Neurimmune. These include charges for in-process research and development and the incremental charges related to the amortization of the acquired intangible assets. Excluding these charges allows management and investors an alternative view of our financial results "as if" the acquired intangible assets had been developed internally rather than acquired and, therefore, provides a supplemental measure of performance in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
Stock option expense  Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS exclude the impact of our stock option expense recorded in accordance with SFAS 123R. We believe that excluding the impact of expensing stock options better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our business. We do include the P&L impact of restricted stock awards and cash incentives in our non-GAAP results.
Other items  Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS exclude other unusual or non-recurring items that are evaluated on an individual basis. Our evaluation of whether to exclude an item for purposes of determining our non-GAAP financial measures considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including, among other things (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.
The Company has reconciled the GAAP net income and diluted EPS for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 to the non-GAAP measures of net income and diluted EPS in Table 3 of this press release.

2008 Full Year Guidance GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments
An itemized reconciliation between projected EPS on a GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis is as follows:
Our "non-GAAP net income" and "non-GAAP diluted EPS" financial measures exclude the following items from GAAP net income and diluted EPS:
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
1.
Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments.
We exclude certain purchase accounting impacts, such as those related to our 2003 merger with Biogen, Inc., the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, Conforma Therapeutics and Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, and the consolidation of Cardiokine and Neurimmune. These include charges for in-process research and development and the incremental charges related to the amortization of the acquired intangible assets. Excluding these charges provides management and investors with a supplemental measure of performance in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
2. Stock option expense recorded in accordance with SFAS 123R.
We believe that excluding the impact of expensing stock options better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our business. We also exclude stock option expense from our non-GAAP R&D expenses and SG&A expenses, but include the P&L impact of restricted stock awards and cash incentives in our non-GAAP results.
3. Unusual or non-recurring items.
We evaluate these on an individual basis, and consider both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.
We believe it is important to share these non-GAAP financial measures with shareholders as they better represent the ongoing economics of the business, reflect how we manage the business internally and set operational goals, and form the basis of our management incentive programs. Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income and diluted EPS.

3. Exercise of Stock Option
          A. Each election to exercise this Stock Option shall be made, in accordance with such rules and procedures as the broker or other third-party administrator retained in connection with the administration of the Plan shall prescribe or in accordance with such other procedures as the Committee may determine. This election shall be made by the Participant or the Participant's executor, administrator, or legally appointed representative (in the event of the Participant's incapacity) or the person or persons to whom this Stock Option is transferred by will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution (collectively, the "Option Holder"), accompanied by payment in full as provided in the Plan. Subject to the further terms and conditions provided in the Plan, the purchase price may be paid in whole or in part in cash or by means of a cashless exercise by withholding that number of shares of common stock of the Company, $0.0005 par value ("Common Stock") whose Fair Market Value is equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Options being exercised. In the event that this Stock Option is exercised by an Option Holder other than the Participant, the Company will be under no obligation to deliver Shares hereunder unless and until it is satisfied as to the authority of the Option Holder to exercise this Stock Option.
          B. On the Expiration Date on which a vested Stock Option is scheduled to terminate in accordance with the terms of the Stock Option, if the Stock Option is unexercised and the per share exercise price is less than the closing price of the Common Stock on that date, the vested Stock Option will be deemed to have been exercised at the close of business on that date. As promptly as practicable thereafter, the Company will deliver to the Participant that number of shares subject to the vested Stock Option less the number of shares with a value that is equal to the aggregate Fair Market Value of (1) the aggregate exercise price of the vested Stock Option and (2) the amount necessary to satisfy any required withholding of taxes or social insurance contributions.
4. Cancellation and Rescission of Awards

5. No Voting Rights/Dividends
          This Stock Option shall not be interpreted to bestow upon the Participant any equity interest or ownership in the Company or any Affiliate prior to the date on which the Company delivers to the Participant shares of Common Stock. The Participant is not entitled to vote any Common Stock by reason of the granting or vesting of this Stock Option or to receive or be credited with any dividends declared and payable on any share of Common Stock underlying this Stock Option prior to its exercise with respect to such share.
6. Withholding
          The Participant shall pay to the Company or make provision satisfactory to the Company for payment of any taxes and/or social insurance contributions required by law to be withheld with respect to the Stock Option prior to the date of exercise. If no such provision is made, the Company and its Affiliates will deduct any such tax and/or social insurance obligations from any payment of any kind due to the Participant hereunder or otherwise. To satisfy the withholding obligations hereunder, the Participant may request the Company to withhold that number of shares whose Fair Market Value is equal to the minimum tax and/or social insurance obligations required by law to be withheld with respect to the Stock Option.

          The grant of this Stock Option shall not constitute a contract of employment or confer upon the Participant any right with respect to the continuance of his/her employment by or other service with the Company or any Affiliate, nor shall it or they be construed as affecting the rights of the Company (or Affiliate) to terminate the service of the Participant at any time or otherwise change the terms of such service, including, without limitation, the right to promote, demote or otherwise re-assign the Participant from one position to another within the Company or any Affiliate.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Cambridge, MA, October 21, 2008  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB), a global biotechnology leader in the discovery, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of innovative therapies, today reported its third quarter 2008 results.
Third Quarter 2008 Highlights:
 
Page 2 Biogen Idec Reports Third Quarter 2008 Results
"We continue to deliver exceptional financial performance as we grow sales of our three key products and advance our pipeline," said James Mullen, Biogen Idec's Chief Executive Officer. "For the first time in the company's history, Biogen Idec reported quarterly revenues in excess of $1 billion. We increased revenues more than 25% and grew earnings by 30% for the fourth consecutive quarter. Our prospects for growth, both now and in the future, remain strong."
Financial Performance
On a reported basis, calculated in accordance with GAAP, Biogen Idec reported net income of $207 million and diluted EPS of $0.70 in the third quarter of 2008. On a non-GAAP basis, Biogen Idec reported net income of $288 million in the third quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP diluted EPS were $0.98 for the third quarter of 2008.
A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included on Table 3 within this press release.
As of September 30, 2008 Biogen Idec had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $2 billion. In the third quarter we recorded a charge of $24 million, or $0.06 per share, in "other income, net" related to the impairment and realized losses of certain assets in the company's investment portfolio.
Revenue Performance
Revenues from AVONEX, one of Biogen Idec's therapies for patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), increased 26% in the third quarter 2008 to $573 million, as compared to the third quarter of 2007. U.S. sales increased 21% to $322 million and international sales increased 33% to $252 million in the third quarter of 2008 as compared to the third quarter 2007.
Revenues for the third quarter of 2008 included $299 million from Biogen Idec's joint business arrangement related to RITUXAN, a treatment for certain B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that Biogen Idec co-promotes in the U.S. with Genentech, Inc. All U.S. sales of RITUXAN are recognized by Genentech, and Biogen Idec records its share of the pretax co-promotion profits. As reported by Genentech, U.S. net sales of RITUXAN were $655 million in the third quarter, as compared to $572 million in the third quarter of 2007.
During the third quarter of 2008, Biogen Idec recognized revenue of $171 million related to TYSABRI comprising:

Safe Harbor
This press release contains forward-looking statements, which appear under the heading "Financial Guidance" above and in the comments from James Mullen, our CEO. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from that which we expect, including our continued dependence on our two principal products, AVONEX and RITUXAN, the uncertainty of success in commercializing other products including TYSABRI, the occurrence of adverse safety events with our products, the failure to execute our growth strategy successfully or to compete effectively in our markets, our dependence on collaborations over which we may not always have full control, possible adverse impact of government regulation and changes in the availability of reimbursement for our products, problems with our manufacturing processes and our reliance on third parties, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, the risks of doing business internationally, fluctuations in our operating results, our significant investments in marketable securities, the impact of the global credit crisis, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and the cost of doing so, product liability claims, fluctuations in our effective tax rate, our substantial indebtedness, environmental risks, the actions of activist shareholders and the other risks and uncertainties that are described in Item 1.A. Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in other reports we file with the SEC. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release, and we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
 
 
 
An itemized reconciliation between projected EPS on a GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis is as follows:
2008 Full Year Guidance GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments
Our "non-GAAP net income" and "non-GAAP diluted EPS" financial measures exclude the following items from GAAP net income and diluted EPS:
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
.
1. Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments
We exclude certain purchase accounting impacts, such as those related to our 2003 merger with Biogen, Inc., the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, Conforma Therapeutics and Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, and the consolidation of Cardiokine and Neurimmune. These include charges for in-process research and development and the incremental charges related to the amortization of the acquired intangible assets. Excluding these charges provides management and investors with a supplemental measure of performance in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
.
2. Stock option expense recorded in accordance with SFAS 123R
We believe that excluding the impact of expensing stock options better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our business. We also exclude stock option expense from our non-GAAP R&D expenses and SG&A expenses, but include P&L impact of restricted stock awards and cash incentives in our non-GAAP results.
.
3. Unusual or non-recurring items
We evaluate these on an individual basis, and consider both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.
We believe it is important to share these non-GAAP financial measures with shareholders as they better represent the ongiong economics of the business, reflect how we manage the business internally and set operational goals, and form the basis of our management incentive programs. Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income and diluted EPS.

2009 Full Year Guidance GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments
An itemized reconciliation between projected EPS on a GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis is as follows:
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our "non-GAAP net income" and "non-GAAP diluted EPS" financial measures exclude the following items from GAAP net income and diluted EPS:
1. Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments.
We exclude certain purchase accounting impacts, such as those related to the 2003 merger between Biogen, Inc. and Idec Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, Conforma Therapeutics and Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, and the consolidation of Cardiokine and Neurimmune. These include charges for in-process research and development and the incremental charges related to the amortization of the acquired intangible assets. Excluding these charges provides management and investors with a supplemental measure of performance in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
2. Stock option expense recorded in accordance with SFAS 123R.
We believe that excluding the impact of expensing stock options better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our business. We also exclude stock option expense from our non-GAAP R&D expenses and SG&A expenses, but include P&L impact of restricted stock awards and cash incentives in our non-GAAP results.
3. Unusual or non-recurring items.
We evaluate these on an individual basis, and consider both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.
We believe it is important to share these non-GAAP financial measures with shareholders as they better represent the ongoing economics of the business, reflect how we manage the business internally and set operational goals, and form the basis of our management incentive programs. Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income and diluted EPS.

Biogen Idec Reports Second Quarter 2009 Results
"During the second quarter we drove a clear acceleration of TYSABRI patient growth that puts the drug on a blockbuster run-rate," said Biogen Idec CEO James C. Mullen, "Going forward, we continue to focus on products, pipeline and performance as the drivers of long-term shareholder value."

Safe Harbor
In addition to historical information, this press release contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current beliefs and expectations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those which we expect. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations include our dependence on our three principal products, AVONEX, RITUXAN and TYSABRI, the importance of market acceptance and successful sales growth of TYSABRI, uncertainty of success in commercializing other products, the occurrence of adverse safety events with our products, competitive pressures, changes in the availability of reimbursement for our products, our dependence on collaborations over which we may not always have full control, failure to execute our growth initiatives, failure to comply with government regulation and possible adverse impact of changes in such regulation, problems with our manufacturing processes and our reliance on third parties, the impact of the global credit crisis, fluctuations in our effective tax rate, our significant investment in a new manufacturing facility in Denmark, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, the risks of doing business internationally, the election of two directors nominated by an activist shareholder, fluctuations in our operating results, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and the cost of doing so, product liability claims, the market, interest and credit risks associated with our portfolio of marketable securities, our level of indebtedness, environmental risks, aspects of our corporate governance and collaborations and the other risks and uncertainties that are

described in Item 1.A. Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K and in other reports we file with the SEC. Forward-looking statements, like all statements in this press release, speak only as of the date of this press release (unless another date is indicated).

EARNINGS PER SHARE
An itemized reconciliation between net income attributable to Biogen Idec, Inc. on a GAAP basis and net income attributable to Biogen Idec, Inc. on a non-GAAP basis is as follows:
2009 Full Year Guidance GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments
An itemized reconciliation between projected EPS on a GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis is as follows:
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our "non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec, Inc." and "non-GAAP diluted EPS" financial measures exclude the following items from GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec, Inc. and diluted EPS:
1. Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments.
We exclude certain purchase accounting impacts, such as those related to the 2003 merger between Biogen, Inc. and Idec Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, Conforma Therapeutics and Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, and the consolidation of Cardiokine and Neurimmune. These include charges for in-process research and development and the incremental charges related to the amortization of the acquired intangible assets. Excluding these charges provides management and investors with a supplemental measure of performance in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
2. Stock option expense recorded in accordance with SFAS 123R.
We believe that excluding the impact of expensing stock options better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our business. We also exclude stock option expense from our non-GAAP R&D expenses and SG&A expenses, but include P&L impact of restricted stock awards and cash incentives in our non-GAAP results.
3. Unusual or non-recurring items.
We evaluate these on an individual basis, and consider both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.
We believe it is important to share these non-GAAP financial measures with shareholders as they better represent the ongoing economics of the business, reflect how we manage the business internally and set operational goals, and form the basis of our management incentive programs. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec, Inc. and diluted EPS should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income attributable to Biogen Idec, Inc. and diluted EPS.

On September 4, 2009, Biogen Idec Inc. issued a press release announcing it has submitted a proposal to the Board of Directors of Facet Biotech Corporation ("Facet") to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Facet for $14.50 per share in cash. The press release, including the full text of a letter dated September 4, 2009 to the Board of Directors of Facet communicating Biogen Idec's proposal, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
The exhibit listed on the Exhibit Index immediately preceding such exhibit is furnished as part of this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: September 4, 2009
 

Exhibit 99.1
Jennifer Neiman, 617-914-6524 Senior Manager, Public Affairs
Biogen Idec Media:
Eric Hoffman, 617-679-2812 Director, Investor Relations
Biogen Idec Investor Relations:
Cambridge, MA, September 4, 2009  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) today announced that it has submitted a proposal to the Board of Directors of Facet Biotech Corporation (NASDAQ: FACT) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Facet for $14.50 per share in cash. The all-cash offer represents a premium of approximately 64% over the closing price of Facet's common stock on September 3, 2009.
In a letter to Facet's Board of Directors, Biogen Idec's President and Chief Executive Officer James C. Mullen stated that Biogen Idec believes the transaction makes compelling business sense for both companies and is in the best interests of their respective shareholders. The letter underscored that the $14.50 per share, all-cash offer represents an extremely attractive opportunity for Facet's shareholders to realize today the future value of their company. Mr. Mullen also stated that Biogen Idec believes the transaction would enable the important multiple sclerosis and solid tumor clinical programs that the companies have been working on in collaboration for nearly four years to have the best chance of reaching the market and improving patients' lives.
Biogen Idec and Facet have been working together since 2005 under a collaboration agreement pursuant to which they have been jointly developing daclizumab for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis and volociximab (M200) for the treatment of solid tumors.
Biogen Idec's proposal is not subject to any financing contingency or approval by Biogen Idec shareholders. Biogen Idec has asked to meet with the Facet Board and its advisors and stated that it is prepared to commit all necessary resources to complete a transaction expeditiously.
Biogen Idec has engaged Leerink Swann LLC as financial advisor and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz as legal counsel in connection with the proposed transaction.
Biogen Idec's interest in acquiring Facet was first conveyed on August 17, 2009 by Mr. Mullen to Faheem Hasnain, President and Chief Executive Officer of Facet. That interest was confirmed in a letter sent to Mr. Hasnain and the Board of Directors of Facet on August 21 proposing a purchase price of $15.00 per share. The August 21 letter stated that it was very important to Biogen Idec that Facet not undertake any material commercial or strategic transactions prior to the consummation of a transaction with Biogen Idec. On August 28, Facet announced a collaboration with Trubion Pharmaceuticals, which Biogen Idec believes reduces the value of Facet, as apparently do Facet's investors, as evidenced by the 22% reduction in Facet's stock price since announcing the Trubion collaboration.
 
Page 2 Biogen Idec Announces Proposal to Acquire All Outstanding Shares of Facet for $14.50 Per Share in Cash
As a result, a revised proposal to acquire Facet for $14.50 per share was conveyed to Mr. Hasnain in a letter sent to Facet's Board of Directors on September 4, 2009. The full text of the letter follows:
September 4, 2009
Facet Biotech Corporation Board of Directors c/o Faheem Hasnain, President and Chief Executive Officer 1500 Seaport Boulevard Redwood City, CA 94063
Dear Faheem:
We are deeply disappointed Facet chose to announce a collaboration with Trubion on the day you and I were scheduled to discuss Biogen Idec's all-cash proposal to acquire Facet, which you rejected on August 25.
Moreover, the timing of the Trubion collaboration follows a sequence of events that suggest you have no interest in having a bona fide discussion with us about a combination of our two companies. As we have stated, we believe such a combination makes compelling business sense for both of our companies and is in the best interests of our respective shareholders.
Accordingly, we have decided to disclose publicly our interest in pursuing a business combination with Facet. We believe your collaboration with Trubion reduces Facet's value, as apparently do Facet's investors, as evidenced by the 22% reduction in Facet's stock price since announcing the Trubion collaboration. As a result, we are lowering the price we are offering to acquire Facet.
We are proposing to acquire Facet for $14.50 per share in cash, which represents a premium of approximately 64% over the closing price of Facet's common stock on September 3, 2009.
The price Biogen Idec is proposing represents an extremely attractive opportunity for Facet's shareholders to realize today the future value of your company. In addition, we believe this transaction will enable the important multiple sclerosis and solid tumor clinical programs that we have been working on in collaboration for nearly four years to have the best chance of reaching the market and improving patients' lives.
 
Page 3 Biogen Idec Announces Proposal to Acquire All Outstanding Shares of Facet for $14.50 Per Share in Cash
Biogen Idec has engaged Leerink Swann LLC as financial advisor and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz as legal counsel to assist us in completing this transaction. Our offer would not be subject to approval by the shareholders of Biogen Idec and is not subject to any financing contingency. We do not foresee any regulatory or other impediment to closing. Any definitive transaction documentation will be subject to the approval of our Board of Directors and would contain conditions completely customary for a transaction of this nature.
We and our advisors are prepared to meet with you and your advisors to answer any questions you may have about our offer. We would like to complete a transaction expeditiously and we are prepared to commit all necessary resources to achieve this goal.
If you are interested in negotiating a transaction, please call me as soon as possible.
Sincerely,
James C. Mullen President and Chief Executive Officer

"Our strong performance this quarter puts us on pace to achieve our 2009 financial goals," said Biogen Idec CEO James C. Mullen. "Equally important, we made significant progress advancing the development of key pipeline programs."
Revenue Performance
Revenues from AVONEX, one of Biogen Idec's therapies for patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), increased 1% to $580 million in the third quarter of 2009 as compared to $573 million in the third quarter of 2008. U.S. sales of AVONEX increased 8% to $348 million year over year. Rest of world sales of AVONEX decreased 8% to $232 million year over year.
Revenues for the third quarter of 2009 included $284 million from Biogen Idec's joint business arrangement related to RITUXAN, a treatment for certain B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that Biogen Idec co-promotes in the U.S. with Genentech. All U.S. sales of RITUXAN are recognized by Genentech, and Biogen Idec records its share of the pretax co-promotion profits. U.S. net sales of RITUXAN were $670 million in the third quarter 2009, as compared to $655 million in the third quarter of 2008, an increase of 2%.

Revenues from other products in the third quarter of 2009 were $15 million, as compared to $14 million in the third quarter of 2008.

Share Repurchase Program
In October 2009, Biogen Idec's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of common stock. This is in addition to the 6 million shares remaining from our previous share repurchase authorization. While we have used the prior program principally for share stabilization, this new $1 billion authorization is intended to reduce our shares outstanding, with the objective of returning excess cash to shareholders. Shares will be purchased on the open market and retired. The authorization is open-ended and is expected to be accretive to EPS. The repurchase reflects our confidence in the long-term value of our common stock and we believe it is an effective way of returning excess cash to our shareholders.
"We are confident in the projected cash flows from our core products, which allow us to return capital to shareholders while continuing to fund future growth through our pipeline. Furthermore, we believe that this will not hamper our ability to capitalize on strategic external growth opportunities" stated Biogen Idec CFO Paul J. Clancy.
The company has approximately 289 million shares of common stock outstanding at the end of September 2009. The company plans to update investors on the progress of this program on future quarterly earnings calls.

In addition to historical information, this press release contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current beliefs and expectations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those which we expect. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations include our dependence on our three principal products, AVONEX, RITUXAN and TYSABRI, the importance of market acceptance and successful sales growth of TYSABRI, uncertainty of success in commercializing other products, the occurrence of adverse safety events with our products, competitive pressures, changes in the availability of reimbursement for our products, our dependence on collaborations over which we may not always have full control, failure to execute our growth initiatives, failure to comply with government regulation and possible adverse impact of changes in such regulation, problems with our manufacturing processes and our reliance on third parties, fluctuations in our effective tax rate, our significant investment in a new manufacturing facility in Denmark, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, the risks of doing business internationally, the election of two directors nominated by an activist shareholder, fluctuations in our operating results, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and the cost of doing so, product liability claims, credit and financial market conditions, the market, interest and credit risks associated with our portfolio of marketable securities, our level of indebtedness, environmental risks, aspects of our corporate governance and collaborations and the other risks and uncertainties that are described in the Risk Factors section of our annual report on Form 10-K and in other reports we file with the SEC.

An itemized reconciliation between net income attributable to Biogen Idec, Inc. on a GAAP basis and net income attributable to Biogen Idec, Inc. on a non-GAAP basis is as follows:
2009 Full Year Guidance GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments
An itemized reconciliation between projected EPS on a GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis is as follows:
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our "non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec, Inc." and "non-GAAP diluted EPS" financial measures exclude the following items from GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec, Inc. and diluted EPS:
1. Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments.
We exclude certain purchase accounting impacts, such as those related to the 2003 merger between Biogen, Inc. and Idec Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, Conforma Therapeutics and Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, and the consolidation of Cardiokine and Neurimmune. These include charges for in-process research and development and the incremental charges related to the amortization of the acquired intangible assets. Excluding these charges provides management and investors with a supplemental measure of performance in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
2. Stock option expense recorded in accordance with the accounting standard for share-based payments.
We believe that excluding the impact of expensing stock options better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our business. We also exclude stock option expense from our non-GAAP R&D expenses and SG&A expenses, but include P&L impact of restricted stock awards and cash incentives in our non-GAAP results.
3. Unusual or non-recurring items.
We evaluate these on an individual basis, and consider both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.
We believe it is important to share these non-GAAP financial measures with shareholders as they better represent the ongoing economics of the business, reflect how we manage the business internally and set operational goals, and form the basis of our management incentive programs. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec, Inc. and diluted EPS should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income attributable to Biogen Idec, Inc. and diluted EPS.

Deuel and Professor Richard A. Young, to the Company's Board at the Annual Meeting.
Under the terms of the Agreement, among other things,
The Icahn Group has agreed (1) to withdraw the Notice, (2) not to conduct, support or participate in, or take certain other actions related to, any proxy or consent solicitations for the Annual Meeting and (3) to vote its shares of Company common stock in favor of the directors nominated by the Company's Board for election at the Annual Meeting.

Dr. Rowinsky was proposed as a nominee to the Company's Board by the Icahn Group and Dr. Sherwin was selected by the Company as part of its process to identify new directors. 
 
Dr. Rowinsky will serve as a member of the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Company's Board.  Dr. Sherwin will serve as a member of the Corporate Governance Committee of the Company's Board.  Upon their appointment to the Company's Board, each of Drs. Rowinsky and Sherwin were awarded an initial grant of stock options to purchase 35,000 shares of the Company's common stock, an additional grant of stock options to purchase 1,325 shares of the Company's common stock and a grant of 500 restricted stock units, each under the Biogen Idec Inc. 2006 Non-Employee Directors Equity Plan.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Cambridge, MA, April 20, 2010  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB), a global biotechnology leader in the discovery, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of innovative therapies, today announced its first quarter 2010 results.
First Quarter 2010 Highlights:
 
Page 2 Biogen Idec Reports First Quarter 2010 Results
First quarter GAAP and non-GAAP results include a $14 million charge resulting from the impairment of our investment in AVEO Pharmaceuticals following its initial public offering in March of this year. First quarter results were also impacted by a $13 million charge due to the recently approved Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This is the result of expanded 340(B) pricing and increased Medicaid rebates mandated by this legislation.
As of March 31, 2010 Biogen Idec had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $2.2 billion.
"We continue to execute on our strategy and actively position Biogen Idec for future growth," said James C. Mullen, Biogen Idec's President and CEO. "We have several efforts underway that have the potential to drive long-term TYSABRI adoption, including the JC virus assay and SURPASS comparative study, our pipeline has great prospects with six programs in registrational trials, and we have solid financial fundamentals with strong cash flow."
TYSABRI Patient Growth
Based upon data available to us through the TOUCH prescribing program and other third-party sources, Biogen Idec estimates that as of the end of March 2010 approximately 50,300 patients were on commercial and clinical TYSABRI therapy worldwide, and that cumulatively approximately 67,700 patients have ever been treated with TYSABRI in the post-marketing setting.
Other Products and Royalties
Revenues from other products in the first quarter of 2010 were $13 million, the same as in the first quarter of 2009.
Table 4 provides individual product revenues.
Royalties were $26 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $24 million in the first quarter of 2009.
 
Page 3 Biogen Idec Reports First Quarter 2010 Results
Share Repurchase Programs
During the first quarter of 2010, Biogen Idec completed the $1 billion share repurchase program announced during the fourth quarter of 2009. The Company repurchased and retired 10.5 million shares at a total cost of $577.6 million during the quarter.
In April 2010, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion share repurchase program with the objective of returning excess cash to shareholders. The shares repurchased under this authorization will be retired. The authorization is open-ended and we expect that repurchases will be made over a longer period than our recently completed $1 billion share repurchase program.

About TYSABRI
TYSABRI is approved in more than 45 countries. In the U.S., it is approved for relapsing forms of MS and in the European Union for relapsing-remitting MS.
Data from the Phase 3 AFFIRM trial highlights TYSABRI's powerful efficacy. According to that data, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, after two years, TYSABRI treatment led to a 68% relative reduction (p<0.001) in the annualized relapse rate when compared with placebo and reduced the relative risk of disability progression by 42-54% (p<0.001). In post-hoc analyses of the Phase 3 AFFIRM trial and as published in The Lancet Neurology, 37% of TYSABRI-treated patients remained free of their MS activity, based on MRI and clinical measures, compared to seven percent of placebo-treated patients.
TYSABRI increases the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an opportunistic viral infection of the brain. The risk of PML increases with increasing duration of use with limited experience beyond three years of treatment. Other serious adverse events that have occurred in TYSABRI-treated patients include hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) and infections, including opportunistic and other atypical infections. Clinically significant liver injury has been reported in patients treated with TYSABRI in the post-marketing setting. Common adverse events reported in TYSABRI-treated MS patients include headache, fatigue, infusion reactions, urinary tract infections, joint and limb pain and rash.
TYSABRI is co-marketed by Biogen Idec and Elan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. For more information about TYSABRI, please visit www.tysabri.com, www.biogenidec.com or www.elan.com, or call 1-800-456-2255.
About AVONEX
AVONEX is one of the most prescribed treatments for relapsing forms of MS worldwide, with nearly 140,000 patients on therapy. It is used worldwide as a treatment for relapsing forms of MS to slow the progression of physical disability and reduce relapses. AVONEX is also approved for patients who have their first clinical MS attack and have a brain MRI scan consistent with MS.
The most common side effects associated with AVONEX MS treatment are flu-like symptoms, including myalgia, fever, fatigue, headache, chills, nausea, vomiting, pain and asthenia.
 
Page 6 Biogen Idec Reports First Quarter 2010 Results
AVONEX should be used with caution in patients with depression or other mood disorders and in patients with seizure disorders. AVONEX should not be used by pregnant women. Patients with cardiac disease should be closely monitored. Patients should also be monitored for signs of hepatic injury. Routine periodic blood chemistry and hematology tests are recommended during treatment with AVONEX. Rare cases of anaphylaxis have been reported. Please see complete prescribing information available at www.axonex.com.

Safe Harbor
In addition to historical information, this press release contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current beliefs and expectations.

Important factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations include our dependence on our three principal products, AVONEX, RITUXAN and TYSABRI, the importance of TYSABRI's sales growth, competitive pressures, uncertainty of success in commercializing other products, the occurrence of adverse safety events with our products, changes in the availability of reimbursement for our products, our dependence on collaborations over which we may not always have full control, failure to execute our growth initiatives, failure to comply with government regulation and possible adverse impact of changes in such regulation, problems with our manufacturing processes and our reliance on third parties, charges and other costs relating to our properties, fluctuations in our effective tax rate, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, the risks of doing business internationally, proxy contests and representation of activist shareholders on our board of directors, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and the cost of doing so, product liability claims, fluctuations in our operating results, credit and financial market conditions, the market, interest and credit risks associated with our portfolio of marketable securities, our level of indebtedness, environmental risks, aspects of our corporate governance and collaborations and the other risks and uncertainties that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual or quarterly report and in other reports we have filed with the SEC.

An itemized reconciliation between net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. on a GAAP basis and net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. on a non-GAAP basis is as follows:
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our "non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec, Inc." and "non-GAAP diluted EPS" financial measures exclude the following items from GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec, Inc. and diluted EPS:
1. Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments.
We exclude certain purchase accounting impacts, such as those related to the 2003 merger between Biogen, Inc. and Idec Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, Conforma Therapeutics and Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, and the consolidation of Cardiokine and Neurimmune. These include charges for in-process research and development and the incremental charges related to the amortization of the acquired intangible assets. Excluding these charges provides management and investors with a supplemental measure of performance in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
2. Stock option expense recorded in accordance with the accounting standard for share-based payments.
We believe that excluding the impact of expensing stock options better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our business. We also exclude stock option expense from our non-GAAP R&D expenses and SG&A expenses, but include P&L impact of restricted stock grants and cash incentives in our non-GAAP results.
3. Unusual or non-recurring items.
We evaluate these on an individual basis, and consider both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.
We believe it is important to share these non-GAAP financial measures with shareholders as they better represent the ongoing economics of the business, reflect how we manage the business internally and set operational goals, and form the basis of our management incentive programs. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec, Inc. and diluted EPS should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income attributable to Biogen Idec, Inc. and diluted EPS.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
     Biogen Idec Inc. (the "Company") announced on June 30, 2010 that George A. Scangos, Ph.D. has been appointed Chief Executive Officer. Dr. Scangos, age 62, is expected to commence employment with the Company on July 15, 2010. In connection with Dr. Scangos' appointment as Chief Executive Officer, the Board of Directors also appointed Dr. Scangos to the Board of Directors of the Company as a Class 2 director effective on the first day of his employment with the Company. He will fill a current vacancy on the Board of Directors, and his term will expire at the 2011 annual meeting of stockholders. Dr. Scangos is not expected to serve on any committee of the Board of Directors and will receive no compensation for his service on the Board of Directors.
     The Company and Dr. Scangos have entered into an Employment Agreement with an initial term of three years. The Employment Agreement provides that Dr. Scangos will receive a base salary at the annual rate of $1,200,000 and a target bonus opportunity under the Company's annual cash incentive plan equal to 125% of his annual base salary, which will be pro-rated for 2010. Dr. Scangos also will receive a one time sign-on bonus of $500,000 and reimbursement for reasonable and customary relocation expenses actually incurred related to his relocation from California to the Boston area.
     Dr. Scangos also will receive a grant of restricted stock units valued at approximately $3,375,000 and a grant of market stock units valued at approximately $3,375,000. Both grants will be made under the Biogen Idec Inc. 2008 Omnibus Equity Plan on Dr. Scangos' first day of employment with the Company. The number of restricted stock units and market stock units subject to each award will be determined based on the closing price of Biogen Idec common stock on that date.
     If Dr. Scangos' employment is terminated by the Company without "cause" or if he terminates his employment for "good reason" (as such terms are defined in the Employment Agreement), then he will be entitled to a lump sum payment of cash severance in the amount of two times his annual base salary and target annual cash bonus. In addition, he would be entitled to receive a pro rata portion of his annual cash bonus in the year such termination occurs to be based on actual performance or, in the event of termination within two years following a change in control, the target annual cash bonus. All unvested long term incentive awards would be forfeited in accordance with their terms.
     If Dr. Scangos retires from the Company after reaching the age of 65, all of his outstanding and unvested restricted stock units and cash settled performance shares will continue to vest as if Dr. Scangos continued to be employed by the Company.
     A copy of the Employment Agreement is filed with this Form 8-K and attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.
     Dr. Scangos has served as a director and as President and Chief Executive Officer of Exelixis, Inc., a biotechnology company, since October 1996. Since October 2003, Dr. Scangos has served as a member of the board of directors of Anadys Pharmaceuticals, Inc., where he assumed the role of Chairman of the board of directors in December 2005. Dr. Scangos also served as a member of the board of directors of Entelos, Inc., a life sciences company, from 2002 until 2010. From September 1993 to October 1996, Dr. Scangos served as President of Biotechnology at Bayer Corporation, a pharmaceutical company, and was responsible for research, business and process development, manufacturing, engineering and quality assurance. Dr. Scangos also serves as the Chair of the California Healthcare Institute (CHI), and as a member of the Board of the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development. Dr. Scangos is also a member of the Board of Visitors of the University of California, San Francisco School of Pharmacy and the Board of Overseers of the University of California, Davis School of
 
Medicine. Our Board of Directors concluded that Dr. Scangos should serve as a director of Biogen Idec in recognition of his leadership role as the Chief Executive Officer of Biogen Idec. The Board of Directors also considered Dr. Scangos' extensive qualifications, including his training as a scientist, his significant knowledge and experience with respect to the biotechnology, healthcare and pharmaceutical industries, and comprehensive leadership background resulting from service on various boards and as an executive in the pharmaceutical industry.

               (iii) a dissolution or liquidation of the Company.

The notice also shall specify the date the Executive's termination of employment is to become effective, which date shall be at least 30 days and not more than 90 days after the date the notice is given; provided, however, that after receiving such notice, the Company shall be permitted to terminate the Executive's employment prior to the specified termination date, which termination shall constitute an Involuntary Employment Action.

As of June 30, 2010, Biogen Idec had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $1.5 billion.
Biogen Idec's newly appointed Chief Executive Officer, George A. Scangos, Ph.D. said, "Biogen Idec had a solid second quarter. Our charge now is to build on the quarter, aggressively execute our marketing plans for AVONEX, complete the patient and risk stratification strategy for TYSABRI, move the late-stage pipeline forward rapidly, and rationalize the R&D portfolio. We have the potential to launch five new products in the next three years. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead and eager to address our challenges head-on and work with the management team and Board to drive Biogen Idec to achieve its full potential."

An itemized reconciliation between net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. on a GAAP basis and net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. on a non-GAAP basis is as follows:
2010 Full Year Guidance GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments
An itemized reconciliation between projected EPS on a GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis is as follows:
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our "non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc." and "non-GAAP diluted EPS" financial measures exclude the following items from GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS:
1. Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments.
We exclude certain purchase accounting impacts, such as those related to the 2003 merger between Biogen, Inc. and Idec Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, Conforma Therapeutics and Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, and the consolidation of Cardiokine and Neurimmune. These include charges for in-process research and development and the incremental charges related to the amortization of the acquired intangible assets. Excluding these charges provides management and investors with a supplemental measure of performance in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
2. Stock option expense recorded in accordance with the accounting standard for share-based payments.
We believe that excluding the impact of expensing stock options better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our business. We exclude stock option expense from our non-GAAP R&D expenses and SG&A expenses, but include the P&L impact of restricted stock grants and cash incentives in our non-GAAP results.
3. Unusual or non-recurring items.
We evaluate these on an individual basis, and consider both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.
We believe it is important to share these non-GAAP financial measures with shareholders as they better represent the ongoing economics of the business, reflect how we manage the business internally and set operational goals, and form the basis of our management incentive programs. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS.

Upon written request by a claimant for indemnification pursuant to the preceding sentence, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to the claimant's entitlement thereto shall be made as follows: (i) if requested by the claimant, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined), or (ii) if no request is made by the claimant for a determination by Independent Counsel, (A) by the Board by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), even though less than a quorum, or (B) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (C) if there are no Disinterested Directors or the Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to the claimant, or (D) if a quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs, by the stockholders of the corporation.

In either event, the claimant or the corporation, as the case may be, shall give written notice to the other advising it of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. The party so notified may, within ten (10) days after such written notice of selection shall have been given, deliver to the corporation or to the claimant, as the case may be, a written objection to such selection; , , that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of "Independent Counsel" as defined in , and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. If such written objection is so made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within thirty (30) days after submission by the claimant of a written request for indemnification pursuant to , no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, either the corporation or the claimant may petition the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the corporation or the claimant to the other's selection of Independent Counsel or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the Court or by such other person as the Court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel hereunder.

If a Change of Control shall have occurred, in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this , the corporation shall have the burden of proving that the claimant is not entitled to indemnification. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct that makes it permissible under the DGCL for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation (including the Board, Independent Counsel or stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor the fact that the corporation (including the Board, Independent Counsel or stockholders) has determined that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

The claimant shall have the right to employ its counsel in such proceeding but the fees and Expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of the claimant unless (i) the employment of counsel by the claimant has been authorized by the corporation, (ii) the claimant shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the corporation and the claimant in the conduct of the defense of such proceeding or (iii) the corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such proceeding, in each of which cases the fees and Expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the corporation. The corporation shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any proceeding brought by or on behalf of the corporation or as to which the claimant shall have made the conclusion provided for in clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence. The claimant shall not compromise or settle any claim or proceeding, release any claim, or make any admission of fact, law, liability or damages with respect to any losses for which indemnification is sought hereunder without the prior written consent of the corporation, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld (subject to the terms and conditions of this , including any determination required by or by applicable law). The corporation shall not be liable for any amount paid by the claimant in settlement of any proceeding or any claim therein, unless the corporation has consented to such settlement or unreasonably withholds consent to such settlement.

     On October 19, 2010, Biogen Idec Inc. and Genentech, Inc., a wholly owned member of the Roche Group, amended and restated their Amended and Restated Collaboration Agreement dated June 19, 2003 with regard to the development of ocrelizumab, a humanized anti-CD20 antibody, and agreed to terms for the development of GA101, a next-generation anti-CD20 antibody, as summarized below.
     
Ocrelizumab
     Genentech will have responsibility for the further development and commercialization of ocrelizumab in multiple sclerosis and will fund all of the related costs going forward. Biogen Idec will be entitled to receive tiered royalties between 13.5% and 24% on U.S. sales of ocrelizumab. Commercialization of ocrelizumab will not impact Biogen Idec's percentage of the co-promotion profits for RITUXAN (rituximab).
     
GA101
     Biogen Idec will increase its share of the losses and profits related to the development and commercialization of GA101 in the U.S. Biogen Idec will pay 35% of the development and commercialization expenses of GA101 and will receive between 35% and 39% of the profits of GA101 based upon the achievement of certain sales milestones. To date, Biogen Idec had paid 30% of the GA101 development expenses. Biogen Idec will pay approximately $10 million to compensate Genentech for Biogen Idec's increased share of such previously incurred expenses. Commercialization of GA101 will impact Biogen Idec's percentage of the co-promotion profits for RITUXAN, as summarized in the table below.
     
RITUXAN
     Biogen Idec's current pretax co-promotion profit-sharing formula, which resets annually, provides for a 30% share of the first $50 million of co-promotion operating profits for RITUXAN in the U.S. and Canada and a 40% share of such profits in excess of $50 million. Biogen Idec's share of the co-promotion profits for RITUXAN will change, as summarized in the table below, upon the following events:

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Weston, MA, October 26, 2010  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB), a global biotechnology leader in the discovery, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of innovative therapies, today announced its third quarter 2010 results.
Third Quarter 2010 Highlights
 
Page 2 Biogen Idec Reports Third Quarter 2010 Results
As of September 30, 2010, Biogen Idec had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $1.4 billion.
"We had another solid quarter driven primarily by increased AVONEX and TYSABRI revenues," said George A. Scangos, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer, Biogen Idec, "We also continued to demonstrate our leadership position in MS with our strong showing at this year's ECTRIMS Congress, while expanding our neurology foothold with the licensing agreement for KNS-760704 (dexpramipexole) for the treatment of ALS."
Progress on TYSABRI Risk Stratification
The company also announced that it and its partner, Elan Corporation, plc, have made substantial progress on TYSABRI risk stratification efforts. Data presented at the 26th Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) further supported the potential clinical utility of an investigational assay that detects anti-JC virus (JCV) antibodies in human plasma or serum. The detection of anti-JCV antibodies may provide a means to segment, or stratify, multiple sclerosis (MS) patients considering or receiving treatment with TYSABRI and assess their risk for developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare, but serious, brain infection. The companies have also completed preliminary discussions with regulators in the US and Europe about these data and plan to submit labeling changes to both agencies by the first quarter of 2011.
Other Products and Royalties
Revenues from other products in the third quarter of 2010 were $12 million compared to $15 million in the third quarter of 2009.
Table 4 provides individual product revenues.
Royalty revenues were $36 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared to $35 million in the third quarter of 2009.
 
Page 3 Biogen Idec Reports Third Quarter 2010 Results
Corporate partner revenues were $5 million in the third quarter of 2010, versus less than $1 million in the third quarter of 2009.
Share Repurchase Programs
In April 2010, the Board approved a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. During the third quarter of 2010, Biogen Idec completed the program by repurchasing and retiring 9 million shares at a total cost of $468 million. In total, since the beginning of the year, Biogen Idec has purchased 40.3 million shares for a total cost of approximately $2.1 billion. Biogen Idec's fully-diluted weighted average shares outstanding were approximately 242 million for the third quarter.
TYSABRI Patient Growth
Based upon data available to Biogen Idec through the TOUCH prescribing program and other third-party sources, Biogen Idec estimates that as of the end of September 2010 approximately 55,100 patients were on commercial and clinical TYSABRI therapy worldwide, and that cumulatively approximately 75,500 patients have ever been treated with TYSABRI in the post-marketing setting.

An itemized reconciliation between net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. on a GAAP basis and net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. on a non-GAAP basis is as follows:
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our "non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc." and "non-GAAP diluted EPS" financial measures exclude the following items from GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS:
1. Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments.
We exclude certain purchase accounting impacts, such as those related to the 2003 merger between Biogen, Inc. and Idec Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, Conforma Therapeutics and Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, and the consolidation of Knopp, Cardiokine and Neurimmune. These include charges for in-process research and development and the incremental charges related to the amortization of the acquired intangible assets. Excluding these charges provides management and investors with a supplemental measure of performance in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
2. Stock option expense recorded in accordance with the accounting standard for share-based payments.
We believe that excluding the impact of expensing stock options better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our business. We exclude stock option expense from our non-GAAP R&D expenses and SG&A expenses, but include the P&L impact of restricted stock grants and cash incentives in our non-GAAP results.
3. Unusual or non-recurring items.
We evaluate these on an individual basis, and consider both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.
We believe it is important to share these non-GAAP financial measures with shareholders as they better represent the ongoing economics of the business, reflect how we manage the business internally and set operational goals, and form the basis of our management incentive programs. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS.

Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
     On October 28, 2010, Biogen Idec committed to a framework for growth through increased focus and efficiency. This framework is the result of an evaluation of Biogen Idec's business and opportunities conducted under the direction of its recently appointed Chief Executive Officer, George A. Scangos. Implementing this framework will involve, among other things, closing and consolidating certain facilities, reducing workforce, and terminating certain research and development programs. Biogen Idec expects these actions to be substantially completed by the end of 2011. The estimated costs associated with these actions are summarized in the table below.
 
     A copy of Biogen Idec's press release dated November 3, 2010 is filed as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
     Robert E. Gagnon was named Chief Accounting Officer, Vice President and Controller of Biogen Idec effective November 3, 2010, replacing Biogen Idec's current Chief Accounting Officer. Mr. Gagnon, age 36, previously served as Vice President, Finance and Controller from July 2007 to November 2010 and as Director of Corporate Accounting from October 2005 to July 2007.

(NASDAQ: BIIB) today announced a number of strategic, operational and organizational changes. The goals of these actions are to increase focus and efficiency and leverage the company's strengths to provide a solid framework for growth.
Weston, Mass.  November 3, 2010 
Biogen Idec
 
Page 2 Biogen Idec Announces Framework for Growth Through Increased Focus and Efficiency
George Scangos, Ph.D., Biogen Idec's Chief Executive Officer, said, "Biogen Idec will be better off as a result of these actions. First, we will have increased focus. We have been operating in too many therapeutic areas and haven't maximized our opportunities. We will now focus on a few areas where we can be among the best, and this starts with neurology. We have excellent R&D and commercial capabilities in neurology, and we will build from that strength. We also have expertise and some excellent programs in hemophilia and immunology and will pursue select projects in those therapeutic areas as well. We will leverage our strengths in biologics manufacturing to bring forward our own projects as well as aggressively in-license projects in our target areas. Second, as a result of these actions, Biogen Idec will be leaner, more nimble and more decisive. Importantly, the initiatives announced today will save more than $300 million annually and will position Biogen Idec to accomplish great things in the future."
Becoming a Global Leader in Neurological Diseases
Biogen Idec intends to expand its global leadership in MS by maximizing the potential of AVONEX (interferon beta-1a) and TYSABRI (natalizumab) and aggressively bringing forward its promising MS pipeline, including fampridine, BG-12, PEGylated interferon, daclizumab and anti-LINGO. The company will aggressively pursue emerging opportunities in personalized medicine for MS patients, positioning Biogen Idec to offer patients and their caregivers personalized treatment options that best match their needs.
In addition, Biogen Idec will leverage its existing neurology R&D expertise to bring life-saving and life-changing therapies to patients with serious neurological diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or Lou Gehrig's disease, and Parkinson's disease, where there is a tremendous need for new treatments. In August 2010, the company expanded its R&D efforts for ALS when it announced a new partnership with Knopp Biosciences to develop and commercialize dexpramipexole. Biogen Idec anticipates beginning a Phase 3 clinical trial with dexpramipexole in the first half of 2011.
Leveraging Strengths in Biologics
Biogen Idec will also employ rigorous criteria for pursuing the treatment of other select serious diseases. For example, the company will leverage its immunobiology, process development and biologics manufacturing expertise to target high-potential treatments for select disorders where there is a significant unmet need and where the drug candidate has the potential to be highly differentiated. Biogen Idec will also continue to pursue its long-acting rFactor VIII and rFactor IX programs, which have the potential to bring much-needed advances to hemophilia patients.
Biogen Idec views strategic partnerships as an important element of a successful R&D effort. The company will seek to leverage its commercial strengths and its expertise in developing and manufacturing biologics to become the leading collaborator in the biotechnology industry.
Scangos said, "Our objective is to focus our resources on the high-priority areas where we see significant value-creation opportunities for patients. In addition, I expect Biogen Idec to become a leading partner in biotechnology. We are the optimal size and scale to understand
 
Page 3 Biogen Idec Announces Framework for Growth Through Increased Focus and Efficiency
the needs of our partners while exploiting our significant strengths in biologics. These changes will help us increase our return on R&D investment and better position the company to deliver on its mission."
Realigning Organization to Build Culture of Excellence
Biogen Idec is taking steps to build a culture of excellence that values a tighter focus on priorities, faster decision-making, enhanced accountability and improved teamwork. These steps include eliminating management layers, reducing bureaucracy and consolidating overlapping corporate committees.
Scangos added, "As Biogen Idec prepares to launch five new products by 2015, it is critical that we drive a culture of excellence. We will better meet the future needs of patients and physicians by leveraging our global reach and improving execution at every level of the business."
The company's current programs with the potential to come to market by 2015 include:
Renewed Focus Will Streamline Structure
As part of the framework for growth, Biogen Idec is reallocating resources within R&D to maximize investment in the highest-potential programs. Accordingly, it will discontinue certain elements of its existing R&D programs, including terminating or outlicensing its oncology and cardiovascular programs. The company will also substantially reduce its small molecule discovery and process development efforts and exit select neurology and immunology development programs, including neublastin for neuropathic pain and anti-TWEAK. In total, the company will exit 11 programs.
The company is realigning its organizational structure consistent with these changes, including streamlining its corporate structure, reducing headcount and consolidating certain facilities. The company will relocate its U.S. workforce from six current locations into three existing state-of-the-art facilities in Weston and Cambridge, Mass., and Research Triangle Park, NC. Facilities in San Diego, Waltham, Mass., and Wellesley, Mass., will be closed.
Additionally, Biogen Idec and Genentech, Inc., a wholly-owned member of the Roche Group, have made an operational decision to the enhance sales effectiveness and profitability of the RITUXAN (rituximab) collaboration in the United States. Biogen Idec will eliminate its current RITUXAN oncology and rheumatology sales force, and Genentech will assume responsibility for the U.S. sales and marketing of RITUXAN.
 
Page 4 Biogen Idec Announces Framework for Growth Through Increased Focus and Efficiency
As a result of these initiatives, the company's workforce will be reduced by approximately 650 full-time positions, or 13% of total full-time employees. Biogen Idec will have approximately 4,275 employees worldwide.
Scangos added, "The loss of jobs at Biogen Idec is something I deeply regret but is an unavoidable outcome of our new focus. The closing of our San Diego site is especially painful, as it is the home of the original IDEC Pharmaceuticals and has played a fundamental role in the success of the company. We value the contributions of all the employees leaving the company, and during this process it is important that we treat everyone fairly and with respect and honesty."
Financial Impact of Framework for Growth
Implementing these changes will result in an estimated $115 million of restructuring costs, comprised of $85 million for the workforce reduction and $30 million to close and consolidate facilities. The company expects that approximately $70 million of these costs will be incurred in the fourth quarter of 2010. In addition, the company made a $25 million payment to Cardiokine in the fourth quarter of 2010 in connection with the termination of the lixivaptan collaboration. The ongoing clinical trial costs for other R&D programs being terminated will be approximately $24 million, which is expected to be incurred through 2011.
These initiatives will result in a stronger financial profile for the company, including reducing annual costs by approximately $300 million, excluding reinvestments for business development opportunities. We expect to begin achieving this level of savings by the middle of 2011.
Biogen Idec also revised its 2010 financial guidance. This guidance consists of the following components:
Biogen Idec may incur charges, realize gains or experience other events in the fourth quarter of 2010 that could cause actual results to vary from this guidance. This guidance excludes any significant business development activities.

2010 Financial Guidance  GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our "non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc." and "non-GAAP diluted EPS" financial measures exclude the following items from GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS:
1. Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments.
We exclude certain purchase accounting impacts, such as those related to the 2003 merger between Biogen, Inc. and Idec Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, Conforma Therapeutics and Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, and the consolidation of KNOPP, Cardiokine and Neurimmune. These include charges for in-process research and development and the incremental charges related to the amortization of the acquired intangible assets. Excluding these charges provides management and investors with a supplemental measure of performance in which the company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
2. Stock option expense recorded in accordance with the accounting standard for share-based payments.
We believe that excluding the impact of expensing stock options better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our business. We exclude stock option expense from our non-GAAP R&D expenses and SG&A expenses, but include the P&L impact of restricted stock grants and cash incentives in our non-GAAP results.
3. Unusual or non-recurring items.
We evaluate these on an individual basis, and consider both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.
 
Page 7 Biogen Idec Announces Framework for Growth Through Increased Focus and Efficiency
In addition, our "core operating expense" excludes from GAAP operating expense the costs related to purchase accounting and merger related expenses, restructuring and severance expense, stock option expense, and income tax effects of those respective items.
We believe it is important to share these non-GAAP financial measures with shareholders as they better represent the ongoing economics of the business, reflect how we manage the business and set operational goals, and form the basis of our management incentive programs. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS.
Numbers may not foot due to rounding.

     On January 21, 2011, Biogen Idec Inc. issued a press release announcing that the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has issued a negative opinion recommending against approval of FAMPYRA (prolonged-release fampridine 10 mg tablets) to improve walking ability in adult patients with multiple sclerosis in the European Union.
     A copy of the press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The exhibits listed on the Exhibit Index immediately preceding such exhibits are filed as part of this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 (NASDAQ: BIIB) announced today that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has issued a negative opinion recommending against approval of FAMPYRA (prolonged-release fampridine 10 mg tablets) to improve walking ability in adult patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) in the European Union. Biogen Idec intends to appeal this opinion and request a re-examination of the decision by the CHMP.
Zug, Switzerland  January 21, 2011
Biogen Idec
"About two-thirds of MS patients report difficulty in walking due to their disease, and currently there is no therapy approved in Europe to address this high unmet medical need," said Alfred Sandrock, M.D., Ph.D., Head of Neurology Research & Development at Biogen Idec. "Tens of thousands of people with MS have already received the therapy in the United States, where it is approved, and many have reported important benefits. We will work closely with the CHMP during the appeal process to address the Committee's concerns, with the goal of making this important medication available to MS patients in Europe."

As a leader in MS with two MS medications on the market and six potential MS therapies in the pipeline, Biogen Idec has significant scientific expertise in MS and is committed to improving the lives of patients with this disease.
As of end of September 2010, approximately 6300 prescribers had initiated approximately 31,000 MS patients on prolonged-release fampridine tablets treatment in the United States (U.S.), where the drug is commercialized by its developer, Acorda Therapeutics, Inc., under the trade name AMPYRA (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10 mg. AMPYRA was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on January 22, 2010.
For further details about the CHMP opinion on FAMPYRA, please visit the EMA website .
www.ema.europa.eu/ema
FAMPYRA 10mg tablets is a prolonged-release (sustained release) tablet formulation of the drug fampridine (4-aminopyridine or 4-AP). FAMPYRA has been developed to improve walking in adult patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). In MS, damaged myelin exposes channels in the membrane of axons allowing potassium ions to leak, weakening the electrical current sent through nerves. Studies have shown that FAMPYRA can increase conduction along damaged nerves, which may result in improved walking ability. This prolonged-release formulation was developed and is being commercialized in the U.S. by Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. It has been approved in the U.S. under the trade name AMPYRA (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10 mg. Biogen Idec plans to commercialize and further develop the product outside of the U.S. under a licensing agreement with Acorda.
About FAMPYRA
In the two Phase III clinical trials, a significantly greater portion (p<0.001) of patients treated with FAMPYRA had a consistent improvement in walking speed when compared to placebo (34.8 percent vs. 8.3 percent and 42.9 percent vs. 9.3 percent, respectively). The
2
 
increased response rate in the FAMPYRA group was observed across all types of MS included in the studies.
The FAMPYRA-treated patients who had consistent improvement in the two studies experienced an average increase in walking speed of 25.2 percent and 24.7 percent compared to 4.7 percent and 7.7 percent, respectively, for the entire placebo group.
The majority of the study participants in these trials were using immunomodulatory drugs, including interferons, glatiramer acetate, and natalizumab; however the magnitude of improvement in walking ability was independent of concomitant therapy.
Patients confirmed the clinical meaningfulness of improved walking using the 12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12), a patient-based assessment that measures the impact of walking impairment on the patient's ability to perform everyday activities.

2011 Full Year Guidance GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments
An itemized reconciliation between projected EPS on a GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis is as follows:
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our "non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc." and "non-GAAP diluted EPS" financial measures exclude the following items from GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS:
1. Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments.
We exclude certain purchase accounting impacts, such as those related to the 2003 merger between Biogen, Inc. and Idec Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, Conforma Therapeutics and Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, and the consolidation of Knopp, Cardiokine and Neurimmune. These include charges for in-process research and development and amortization of the acquired intangible assets. Excluding these charges provides management and investors with a supplemental measure of performance in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
2. Stock option expense recorded in accordance with the accounting standard for share-based payments.
We believe that excluding the impact of expensing stock options better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our business. We exclude stock option expense from our non-GAAP R&D expenses and SG&A expenses, but include the P&L impact of all other share-based awards and cash incentives in our non-GAAP results.
3. Unusual or non-recurring items.
We evaluate these on an individual basis, and consider both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.
We believe it is important to share these non-GAAP financial measures with shareholders as they better represent the ongoing economics of the business, reflect how we manage the business internally and set operational goals, and form the basis of our management incentive programs. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS.

"We continued our transformation into a lean, aggressive and focused company, and the reinvigoration of Research and Development is well underway. We met several exciting pipeline milestones, including the positive Phase III data read-out from the DEFINE trial for BG-12, our oral MS drug candidate, and the enrollment of the first patient in our Phase III EMPOWER trial for dexpramipexole, a potential treatment for ALS. We continue to unlock TYSABRI's potential through cutting edge science and are encouraged by the CHMP's positive opinion to include anti-JC virus antibody status as an additional risk factor for PML in the TYSABRI label. With these successes, we look forward to continue to drive our core business and advance our deep late-stage pipeline."

During the first quarter of 2011, Biogen Idec repurchased 2.8 million shares of stock at a total cost of $195 million.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our "non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc." and "non-GAAP diluted EPS" financial measures exclude the following items from GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS:
.
1. Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments
We exclude certain purchase accounting impacts, such as those related to the 2003 merger between Biogen, Inc. and Idec Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, and Panima Pharmaceuticals AG and the consolidation of Knopp, Cardiokine and Neurimmune. These include charges for in-process research and development and amortization of the acquired intangible assets. Excluding these charges provides management and investors with a supplemental measure of performance in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
          On June 1, 2011, the Board of Directors approved the form of indemnification agreement for the directors and executive officers of Biogen Idec Inc. (the "Company"). Each of the Company's directors and executive officers will execute this indemnification agreement, which will supersede any pre-existing indemnification agreements. Under the form of indemnification agreement:
The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of indemnification agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
          At the 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 2, 2011, stockholders approved an amendment to Article VII of the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (Charter Amendment) that declassified the Board of Directors and instituted annual voting for each director beginning with the 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Upon stockholder approval of the Charter Amendment, conforming amendments to the Company's Second Amended and Restated Bylaws (Bylaws) became effective as well. These Bylaw amendments removed references to a classified Board in Sections 2.2, 3.1 and 3.2, and reflect stockholders' ability under Delaware General Corporation Law Section 141(k) to remove directors on a declassified Board with or without cause in Section 3.3.
          On June 1, 2011, the Board of Directors added a new Section 8.8 to the Bylaws to establish the Delaware Court of Chancery as the exclusive forum for resolving derivative actions and claims alleging a violation of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, or breach of fiduciary duties or other violation of Delaware decisional law relating to the internal affairs of the Company.
          The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copy of the Charter Amendment and Bylaw amendments, which are filed as Exhibit 3.1 and Exhibit 3.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
     We expect that our share of RITUXAN (rituximab) revenues from unconsolidated joint business will be reduced by approximately $50 million during the second quarter of 2011 as a result of an accrual for estimated compensatory damages (including interest) relating to an intermediate decision by the arbitrator in Genentech, Inc.'s ongoing arbitration with Hoechst GmbH. Although we are not a party to the arbitration, we expect that certain damages that may be awarded to Hoechst will be a cost charged to our collaboration with Genentech. We expect the impact in subsequent quarters will be limited to adjustments necessary to reflect the difference between our estimate and the damages attributable to our collaboration or a successful challenge by Genentech of the arbitrator's decision.
     As previously disclosed, Genentech and Hoechst have been arbitrating Hoechst's claims under a license agreement between Hoechst's predecessor and Genentech that was terminated in October 2008. The license agreement provided for royalty payments of 0.5% on net sales of certain products defined by the agreement. The arbitrator's intermediate decision indicates that RITUXAN is such a product and orders Genentech to provide certain RITUXAN sales information for the period from December 15, 1998 to October 27, 2008. The arbitrator will use this information to ascertain the amount of damages to be awarded to Hoechst.

2011 Full Year Guidance GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments
An itemized reconciliation between projected EPS on a GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis is as follows:
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our "non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc." and "non-GAAP diluted EPS" financial measures exclude the following items from GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS:
1. Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments.
We exclude certain purchase accounting impacts, such as those related to the 2003 merger between Biogen, Inc. and Idec Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, Conforma Therapeutics, Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, and Panima Pharmaceuticals AG and the consolidation of Knopp and Cardiokine. These include charges for in-process research and development and amortization of the acquired intangible assets. Excluding these charges provides management and investors with a supplemental measure of performance in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
2. Stock option expense recorded in accordance with the accounting standard for share-based payments.
We believe that excluding the impact of expensing stock options better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our business. We exclude stock option expense from our non-GAAP R&D expenses and SG&A expenses, but include the impact of all other share-based awards and cash incentives in our non-GAAP results.
3. Other items.
We evaluate these on an individual basis, and consider both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.
We believe it is important to share these non-GAAP financial measures with shareholders as they better represent the ongoing economics of the business, reflect how we manage the business internally and set operational goals, and form the basis of our management incentive programs. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS.

The recent positive data readout from the CONFIRM trial of BG-12 is a truly meaningful development for our company and for multiple sclerosis patients, and we are thrilled by it. We now have strong results for BG-12 in two large and robust clinical trials and we anticipate filing for approval in the first half of next year with the intent of bringing this potentially major new therapy to MS patients as soon as possible. We continue to improve the quality of our pipeline by concentrating on cutting-edge science with the greatest potential to help patients and drive growth, and we are focused on excellence in execution as we prepare for the potential of multiple product launches in coming years."

Based upon data available to us through the TOUCH prescribing program and other third-party sources, as of the end of September 2011, we estimate that approximately 63,500 patients were on commercial and clinical TYSABRI therapy worldwide, and that cumulatively approximately 92,200 patients have ever been treated with TYSABRI in the post-marketing setting.

2012 Full Year Guidance GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments
An itemized reconciliation between projected EPS on a GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis is as follows:
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our "non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc." and "non-GAAP diluted EPS" financial measures exclude the following items from GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS:
1. Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments.
We exclude certain purchase accounting impacts, such as those related to the 2003 merger between Biogen, Inc. and Idec Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, Conforma Therapeutics, Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, and Panima Pharmaceuticals AG and the consolidation of Knopp and Cardiokine. These include charges for in-process research and development and amortization of the acquired intangible assets. Excluding these charges provides management and investors with a supplemental measure of performance in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
2. Stock option expense recorded in accordance with the accounting standard for share-based payments.
We believe that excluding the impact of expensing stock options better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our business. We exclude stock option expense from our non-GAAP R&D expenses and SG&A expenses, but include the impact of all other share-based awards and cash incentives in our non-GAAP results.
3. Other items.
We evaluate these on an individual basis, and consider both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.
We believe it is important to share these non-GAAP financial measures with shareholders as they better represent the ongoing economics of the business, reflect how we manage the business internally and set operational goals, and form the basis of our management incentive programs. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS.

Weston, MA, May 1, 2012  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB), a global biotechnology leader in the discovery, development, manufacturing and commercialization of innovative therapies, today announced its first quarter 2012 results.
First Quarter 2012 Highlights:
 
 
 
As of March 31, 2012, Biogen Idec had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $2.7 billion.
The company also announced today that it expects to repurchase an additional $500 million in shares over the balance of the year for the purpose of retiring shares and returning capital to shareholders.
"Our revenue growth in the first quarter reflects our strong business fundamentals," said George A. Scangos, Ph.D., the company's chief executive officer. "While AVONEX orders in January were impacted by what we believe to be isolated events, sales rebounded quickly and we believe the underlying AVONEX business is solid. TYSABRI and RITUXAN generated double-digit sales growth. We filed for marketing approval for our oral MS candidate BG-12 in both the U.S. and Europe and continued to ramp up R&D activity as we executed on six phase III programs and advanced our early-stage pipeline. We're optimistic about our business outlook for the year."
TYSABRI Patient Growth
Based upon data available to us through the TOUCH prescribing program and other third-party sources, as of the end of March 2012, we estimate that approximately 66,600 patients were on commercial and clinical TYSABRI therapy worldwide, and that cumulatively approximately 99,600 patients have ever been treated with TYSABRI in the post-marketing setting.
Investing for the Future
The company is preparing for the potential of multiple product launches in the coming years. With the expectation of an early 2013 launch for BG-12 (dimethyl fumarate) in the U.S. and 2013 launches in hemophilia, it continued to make investments in the first quarter in product positioning and promotional planning, scientific outreach, shaping its patient support services, and supply chain.
The company also made significant headway on its R&D pipeline. It anticipates phase III data readouts in the second half of the year from its long-lasting factor VIII and long-lasting factor IX programs for hemophilia and dexpramipexole for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Its partner Isis Pharmaceuticals began dosing patients in a phase I study
 
 
for ISIS-SMN
Rx
for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the most common genetic cause of infant mortality, and the companies expect results in late 2013. Through the recent acquisition of Stromedix, Biogen Idec added STX-100, a novel humanized monoclonal antibody that is expected to initiate a phase II study by mid-year in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a debilitating and almost uniformly fatal disease in which patients experience progressive difficulty breathing due to scarring of the lung.
Other Products and Royalties
Revenues from other products in the first quarter of 2012 were $28 million, compared to $13 million in the first quarter of 2011.
Table 4 provides individual product revenues.
Royalties were $29 million in the first quarter of 2012, an increase of 13% compared to the first quarter of 2011.
For the first quarter of 2012, corporate partner revenues were $3 million, compared to $15 million in the first quarter of 2011.
Updated 2012 Financial Guidance
Biogen Idec also updated its full year 2012 financial guidance. This guidance consists of the following components:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biogen Idec may incur charges, realize gains or experience other events in 2012 that could cause actual results to vary from this guidance.

An itemized reconciliation between net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. on a GAAP basis and net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. on a non-GAAP basis is as follows:
 
2012 Full Year Guidance GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments
An itemized reconciliation between projected EPS on a GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis is as follows:
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our "non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc." and "non-GAAP diluted EPS" financial measures exclude the following items from GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS:
1. Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments.
We exclude certain purchase accounting impacts, such as those related to the 2003 merger between Biogen, Inc. and Idec Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, Conforma Therapeutics, Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, Panima Pharmaceutical AG, and Stromedix Inc, the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest of Biogen Dompe SRL and Biogen Dompe Switzerland GmbH and the consolidation of Knopp. These include charges for in-process research and development, amortization of the acquired intangible assets and changes in contingent consideration. Excluding these charges provides management and investors with a supplemental measure of performance in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
2. Stock option expense recorded in accordance with the accounting standard for share-based payments.
We believe that excluding the impact of expensing stock options better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our business. We exclude stock option expense from our non-GAAP R&D expenses and SG&A expenses, but include the impact of all other share-based awards and cash incentives in our non-GAAP results.
3. Other items.
We evaluate these on an individual basis, and consider both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.
We believe it is important to share these non-GAAP financial measures with shareholders as they better represent the ongoing economics of the business, reflect how we manage the business internally and set operational goals, and form the basis of our management incentive programs. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS.

Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
At the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Biogen Idec Inc. (Company) held on June 8, 2012 (Annual Meeting), stockholders approved an amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (Charter Amendment) that designates Delaware as the exclusive forum for resolving derivative actions and certain other disputes.

Exhibit 3.2
Within the Second Amended and Restated Bylaws of Biogen Idec Inc.:
 
 
2.3A
Special Meetings Called by Stockholders
(a) Special meetings of the stockholders (each a "Stockholder Requested Special Meeting") shall be called by the Secretary upon the written request of a stockholder (or a group of stockholders formed for the purpose of making such request) who or which (i) has Net Long Beneficial Ownership (as defined below) of 25% or more of the outstanding common stock of the corporation (the "Requisite Percent") as of the date of submission of the request and (ii) has or have had continuous Net Long Beneficial Ownership of at least the same amount of securities so owned by such stockholder or by each member of such group of stockholders for at least one year as of the date of such request, subject to section 2.3A(b) below. Compliance by the requesting stockholder or group of stockholders with the requirements of this section and related provisions of these bylaws shall be determined in good faith by the Board, which determination shall be conclusive and binding on the corporation and the stockholders.
"Net Long Beneficial Ownership" (and its correlative terms), when used to describe the nature of a stockholder's ownership of common stock of the corporation, shall mean those shares of common stock of the corporation as to which the stockholder in question possesses (a) the sole power to vote or direct the voting, (b) the sole economic incidents of ownership (including the sole right to profits and the sole risk of loss), and (c) the sole power to dispose of or direct the disposition. The number of shares calculated in accordance with clauses (a), (b) and (c) shall not include any shares (i) sold by such stockholder in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, (ii) borrowed by such stockholder for any purposes or purchased by such stockholder pursuant to an agreement to resell or (iii) subject to any option, warrant, derivative or other agreement or understanding, whether any such arrangement is to be settled with shares of common stock of the corporation or with cash based on the notional amount of shares subject thereto, in any such case which has, or is intended to have, the purpose or effect of (A) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, such stockholder's rights to vote or direct the voting and full rights to dispose or direct the disposition of any of such shares or (B) offsetting to any degree gain or loss arising from the sole economic ownership of such shares by such stockholder.
(b) A request for a Stockholder Requested Special Meeting must be signed by the Requisite Percent of stockholders (or their duly authorized agents) and be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation by registered mail, return receipt requested. Such request shall (i) set forth a statement of the specific purpose or purposes of the meeting and the matters proposed to be acted on at such special meeting, (ii) bear the date of signature of each such stockholder (or duly authorized agent) signing the
request, (iii) set forth (A) the name and address, as they appear in the corporation's stock ledger, of each stockholder signing such request (or on whose behalf the request is signed), (B) the class, if applicable, and the number of shares of common stock of the corporation as to which such stockholder has Net Long Beneficial Ownership, (C) include evidence of the fact and duration of such stockholder's beneficial ownership of such stock consistent with that which is required under Regulation 14A under the 1934 Act and (D) a certification that the stockholder satisfies the Net Long Beneficial Ownership requirement of these bylaws, (iv) set forth all information relating to each such stockholder that must be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest (even if an election contest is not involved), or is otherwise required, in each case, pursuant to Regulation 14A under the 1934 Act, (v) contain the information required by Section 2.2 of these bylaws and (vi) include an acknowledgment by each stockholder and any duly authorized agent that any disposition of shares of common stock of the corporation as to which such stockholder has Net Long Beneficial Ownership as of the date of delivery of the special meeting request and prior to the record date for the proposed meeting requested by such stockholder shall constitute a revocation of such request with respect to such shares. In addition, the stockholder and any duly authorized agent shall promptly provide any other information reasonably requested by the corporation to allow it to satisfy its obligations under applicable law. Any requesting stockholder may revoke a request for a special meeting at any time by written revocation delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation. If, following such revocation at any time before the date of the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting, the remaining requests are from stockholders holding in the aggregate less than the Requisite Percent, the Board, in its discretion, may cancel the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Secretary shall not be required to call a special meeting of stockholders if (i) the Board has called or calls an annual or special meeting of stockholders to be held not later than sixty (60) days after the date on which a valid request has been delivered to the Secretary (the "Delivery Date"); or (ii) the request (A) is received by the Secretary during the period commencing ninety (90) days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting and ending on the date of the next annual meeting; (B) contains an identical or substantially similar item (a "Similar Item") to an item that was presented at any meeting of stockholders held within one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the Delivery Date (and, for purposes of this clause (B) the election of directors shall be deemed a "Similar Item" with respect to all items of business involving the election or removal of directors); (C) relates to an item of business that is not a proper subject for action by the stockholders of the corporation under applicable law; (D) was made in a manner that involved a violation of Regulation 14A under the 1934 Act or other applicable law; or (E) does not comply with the provisions of this Section 2.3A.
(d) Any Stockholder Requested Special Meeting shall be held at such date, time and place within or without the state of Delaware as may be fixed by the Board; provided, however, that the date of any Stockholder Requested Special Meeting shall be not more than sixty (60) days after the record date for such meeting (the "Meeting Record Date"), which shall be fixed in accordance with Section 2.11 of these bylaws and if the Board fails to designate, within ten (10) days after the Delivery Date, the Meeting Record Date, then such
Meeting Record Date shall be twenty (20) days after the Delivery Date; provided further that, if the Board fails to designate, within ten (10) days after the Delivery Date, a date and time for a Stockholder Requested Special Meeting, then such meeting shall be held at 9:00 a.m. local time on the 60th day after the Meeting Record Date (or, if that day shall not be a business day, then on the next preceding business day); and provided further that in the event that the Board fails to designate a place for a Stockholder Requested Special Meeting within ten (10) days after the Delivery Date, then such meeting shall be held at the corporation's principal executive offices. In fixing a date and time for any Stockholder Requested Special Meeting, the Board may consider such factors as it deems relevant within the good faith exercise of business judgment, including, without limitation, the nature of the matters to be considered, the facts and circumstances surrounding any request for meeting and any plan of the Board to call an annual meeting or a special meeting.
(e) Business transacted at any Stockholder Requested Special Meeting shall be limited to the purpose(s) stated in the request; provided, however, that nothing herein shall prohibit the corporation from submitting matters to a vote of the stockholders at any Stockholder Requested Special Meeting.
 
8.8
Exclusive Jurisdiction
The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action brought on behalf of the corporation and (2) any direct action brought by a stockholder against the corporation or any of its directors or officers alleging a violation of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the corporation's certificate of incorporation or bylaws or breach of fiduciary duties or other violation of Delaware decisional law relating to the internal affairs of the corporation; in each case excluding actions in which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware concludes that an indispensable party is not subject to the jurisdiction of the Delaware courts and can be subject to the jurisdiction of another court within the United States.

Weston, MA, July 24, 2012  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB), a global biotechnology leader in the discovery, development, manufacturing and commercialization of innovative therapies, today announced its second quarter 2012 results.
Second Quarter 2012 Highlights:
 
 
 
As of June 30, 2012, Biogen Idec had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $2.9 billion.
During the second quarter, the company also completed its previously announced $500 million share repurchase for the purpose of retiring shares and returning capital to shareholders.
"At the midpoint of a pivotal year, we continue to succeed in the marketplace and track against our goals," said George A. Scangos, Ph.D., the company's chief executive officer. "AVONEX performance was particularly strong in the second quarter. There has been strong uptake of the AVONEX PEN and AVOSTARTGRIP
TM
titration dosing kit in both the US and EU. We have a busy nine months ahead of us preparing for the BG-12 launch and four pivotal trial data readouts  for our long-lasting blood factors VIII and IX for hemophilia, dexpramipexole for ALS and PEGylated interferon beta-1a for multiple sclerosis. We continued to strengthen our early-stage pipeline and stepped up the pace of revitalizing our discovery efforts. We had a very productive quarter, delivering both revenue and earnings growth, while continuing to invest in the company's future."
TYSABRI Patient Growth
Based upon data available to us through the TOUCH prescribing program and other third-party sources, as of the end of June 2012, we estimate that approximately 69,100 patients were on commercial and clinical TYSABRI therapy worldwide, and that cumulatively approximately 104,300 patients have ever been treated with TYSABRI in the post-marketing setting.
Building for the Future
The company is preparing for the potential of multiple product launches in the coming years. In addition to earlier filings in the U.S. and EU, Biogen Idec filed in Canada, Switzerland and Australia in the second quarter for regulatory approval for BG-12 (dimethyl fumarate), its oral drug candidate for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS).
 
Biogen Idec also continued to advance its R&D pipeline, initiating two global pediatric studies for its long-lasting factor VIII and factor IX programs for hemophilia and completing enrollment in the Phase 3 A-LONG and B-LONG trials for the long-lasting blood factors as well as the Phase 3 DECIDE study of daclizumab in MS. We enrolled our first patient in the Phase 2a study for STX-100, a novel monoclonal antibody, in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We also added a preclinical program through a second worldwide option and collaboration agreement with Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc. to develop and commercialize a novel antisense drug for the treatment of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), which is the most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults. The company remains on track for phase III data readouts in the second half of the year for its long-lasting blood factors and dexpramipexole for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
As part of an ongoing effort to stimulate its drug discovery engine, the company is funding a consortium of world-class ALS researchers from six top academic and research institutions to map the genomes of up to 1,000 patients with ALS within five years.
Other Products and Royalty Revenues
Revenues from other products in the second quarter of 2012 were $34 million, compared to $16 million in the second quarter of 2011.
Table 4 provides individual product revenues.
Royalty revenues were $37 million in the second quarter of 2012, an increase of 29% compared to the second quarter of 2011.

About AVONEX
AVONEX is one of the most prescribed treatments for relapsing forms of MS worldwide. AVONEX is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of MS to slow the accumulation of physical disability and decrease the frequency of clinical exacerbations. Patients with MS in whom efficacy has been demonstrated include patients who have experienced a first clinical episode and have MRI features consistent with MS.
Symptoms of depression, suicidal ideation, or psychosis, and cases of suicide, have been reported with increased frequency with patients receiving AVONEX. Severe hepatic injury, including cases of hepatic failure has been reported rarely in patients. Rare cases of anaphylaxis have been reported. While beta interferons do not have any known direct cardiac toxicity, cases of congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure have been reported in patients without known predisposition. Decreased peripheral blood counts have been reported from postmarketing experience. Seizures have been reported in patients using AVONEX, including patients with no prior history of seizure. Autoimmune disorders of multiple target organs have been reported. Routine periodic blood chemistry, hematology, liver function, and thyroid function tests are recommended. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. AVONEX should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. The most common side effects associated with AVONEX treatment are flu-like symptoms, including chills, fever, myalgia, and asthenia.

About TYSABRI
TYSABRI is approved in more than 65 countries. TYSABRI is approved in the United States as a monotherapy for relapsing forms of MS, generally for patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, an alternative MS therapy. In the European Union, it is approved for highly active relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) in adult patients who have failed to respond to beta interferon or have rapidly evolving, severe RRMS.
TYSABRI has advanced the treatment of MS patients with its established efficacy. Data from the Phase 3 AFFIRM trial, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed that after two years, TYSABRI treatment led to a 68 percent relative reduction (p<0.001) in the annualized relapse rate when compared with placebo and reduced the relative risk of disability progression by 42-54 percent (p<0.001).
 
TYSABRI increases the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an opportunistic viral infection of the brain, which usually leads to death or severe disability. Infection by the JC virus (JCV) is required for the development of PML and patients who are anti-JCV antibody positive have a higher risk of developing PML. Factors that increase the risk of PML are presence of anti-JCV antibodies, prior immunosuppressant use, and longer TYSABRI treatment duration. Patients who have all three risk factors have the highest risk of developing PML. Other serious adverse events that have occurred in TYSABRI-treated patients include hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) and infections, including opportunistic and other atypical infections. Clinically significant liver injury has also been reported in the post-marketing setting. A list of adverse events can be found in the full TYSABRI product labeling for each country where it is approved.
TYSABRI is marketed and distributed by Biogen Idec Inc. and Elan Corporation, plc. For full prescribing information, including boxed warning and important safety information, and more information about TYSABRI, please visit or .

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis by providing additional measures which may be considered "non-GAAP" financial measures under applicable SEC rules. We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional insight into the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage our business internally, set operational goals and forms the basis of our management incentive programs. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted earnings per share.
Our "Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc." and "Non-GAAP earnings per share - Diluted" financial measures exclude the following items from GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted earnings per share:
1. Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments.
We exclude certain charges related to the 2003 merger between Biogen Inc. and Idec Pharmaceuticals, Inc., certain acquisition-related items, and certain amounts in relation to the consolidation of variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. These adjustments include charges for in-process research and development, the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets and adjustments to the fair value of our contingent consideration obligations. The exclusion of these charges provides management and investors with a supplemental measure of performance which the Company believes better reflects the underlying economics of the business.
2. Stock option expense recorded in accordance with the accounting standard for share-based payments.
We believe that excluding the impact of expensing stock options better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our business.
3. Other items.
We evaluate other items on an individual basis, and consider both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.
We also include an adjustment to reflect the related tax effect of all reconciling items within our reconciliation of our GAAP to Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc.

CORRECTIONby Biogen Idec Inc.
WESTON, Mass.  (BUSINESS WIRE)  Second graph after the first series of bullets should read: The company also completed its previously(sted During the second quarter, the company also completed its previously).
The corrected release reads:
Weston, MA, July 24, 2012  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB), a global biotechnology leader in the discovery, development, manufacturing and commercialization of innovative therapies, today announced its second quarter 2012 results.
Second Quarter 2012 Highlights:
 
 
 
 
As of June 30, 2012, Biogen Idec had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $2.9 billion.
The company also completed its previously announced $500 million share repurchase for the purpose of retiring shares and returning capital to shareholders.
"At the midpoint of a pivotal year, we continue to succeed in the marketplace and track against our goals," said George A. Scangos, Ph.D., the company's chief executive officer. "AVONEX performance was particularly strong in the second quarter. There has been strong uptake of the AVONEX PEN and AVOSTARTGRIP
TM
titration dosing kit in both the US and EU. We have a busy nine months ahead of us preparing for the BG-12 launch and four pivotal trial data readouts  for our long-lasting blood factors VIII and IX for hemophilia, dexpramipexole for ALS and PEGylated interferon beta-1a for multiple sclerosis. We continued to strengthen our early-stage pipeline and stepped up the pace of revitalizing our discovery efforts. We had a very productive quarter, delivering both revenue and earnings growth, while continuing to invest in the company's future."
TYSABRI Patient Growth
Based upon data available to us through the TOUCH prescribing program and other third-party sources, as of the end of June 2012, we estimate that approximately 69,100 patients were on commercial and clinical TYSABRI therapy worldwide, and that cumulatively approximately 104,300 patients have ever been treated with TYSABRI in the post-marketing setting.
 
Building for the Future
The company is preparing for the potential of multiple product launches in the coming years. In addition to earlier filings in the U.S. and EU, Biogen Idec filed in Canada, Switzerland and Australia in the second quarter for regulatory approval for BG-12 (dimethyl fumarate), its oral drug candidate for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS).
Biogen Idec also continued to advance its R&D pipeline, initiating two global pediatric studies for its long-lasting factor VIII and factor IX programs for hemophilia and completing enrollment in the Phase 3 A-LONG and B-LONG trials for the long-lasting blood factors as well as the Phase 3 DECIDE study of daclizumab in MS. We enrolled our first patient in the Phase 2a study for STX-100, a novel monoclonal antibody, in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We also added a preclinical program through a second worldwide option and collaboration agreement with Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc. to develop and commercialize a novel antisense drug for the treatment of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), which is the most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults. The company remains on track for phase III data readouts in the second half of the year for its long-lasting blood factors and dexpramipexole for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
As part of an ongoing effort to stimulate its drug discovery engine, the company is funding a consortium of world-class ALS researchers from six top academic and research institutions to map the genomes of up to 1,000 patients with ALS within five years.
Other Products and Royalty Revenues
Revenues from other products in the second quarter of 2012 were $34 million, compared to $16 million in the second quarter of 2011.
Table 4 provides individual product revenues.
Royalty revenues were $37 million in the second quarter of 2012, an increase of 29% compared to the second quarter of 2011.
For the second quarter of 2012, corporate partner revenues were $22 million, compared to $7 million in the second quarter of 2011.

About AVONEX
AVONEX is one of the most prescribed treatments for relapsing forms of MS worldwide. AVONEX is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of MS to slow the accumulation of physical disability and decrease the frequency of clinical exacerbations. Patients with MS in whom efficacy has been demonstrated include patients who have experienced a first clinical episode and have MRI features consistent with MS.
Symptoms of depression, suicidal ideation, or psychosis, and cases of suicide, have been reported with increased frequency with patients receiving AVONEX. Severe hepatic injury, including cases of hepatic failure has been reported rarely in patients. Rare cases of anaphylaxis have been reported. While beta interferons do not have any known direct cardiac toxicity, cases of congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure have been reported in patients without known predisposition. Decreased peripheral blood counts have been reported from postmarketing experience. Seizures have been reported in patients using AVONEX, including patients with no prior history of seizure. Autoimmune disorders of multiple target organs have been reported. Routine periodic blood chemistry, hematology, liver function, and thyroid function tests are recommended. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. AVONEX should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. The most common side effects associated with AVONEX treatment are flu-like symptoms, including chills, fever, myalgia, and asthenia.

2.2    
Annual Meeting
Annual meetings of stockholders shall be held each year at such place, date and time as shall be designated from time to time by the Board and stated in the notice of the meeting. At each such annual meeting, the stockholders shall elect directors to hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders after their election and until their successors are duly elected and qualified or until their earlier resignation, removal from office, death or incapacity. Except in a contested election, the vote required for the election of a director by the stockholders shall be the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in favor of or against a nominee. In a contested election, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes so cast. A contested election shall be one in which there are more nominees than positions on the Board to be filled at the meeting as of the fourteenth (14th) day prior to the date on which the corporation files its definitive proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any subsequent amendment or supplement of the definitive proxy statement shall not affect the status of the election. The stockholders shall also transact such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting.
To be properly brought before the annual meeting, nominations of persons for election to the Board must be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.1.
Subject to the last paragraph of this Section 2.2, to be properly brought before the annual meeting, business other than nominations of persons for election to the Board must be (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board or the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer, (b) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board (or any committee thereof) or the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer, or (c) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder of record of the corporation at the time of giving of notice of meeting pursuant to Section 2.4 and at the time of the meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who otherwise complies with this Section 2.2. For any proposed business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (c) above of this paragraph, the proposed business must constitute a proper matter for stockholder action. Any such stockholder may propose business to be brought before a meeting only if such stockholder has given timely notice to the Secretary of the corporation in proper written form of the
stockholders intent to propose such business. To be timely, the stockholders notice must be delivered by a nationally recognized courier service or mailed by first class United States mail, postage or delivery charges prepaid, and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation addressed to the attention of the Secretary of the corporation not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days in advance of the first anniversary of the date the corporations proxy statement was released to the stockholders in connection with the previous years annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting is more than (30) days before or more than (60) days after the first anniversary of the previous years annual meeting of stockholders, notice by the stockholder must be received by the Secretary of the corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (x) the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting and (y) the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. For the purposes of these bylaws, public announcement shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or a comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of stockholders notice as described above. To be in proper form, a stockholders notice to the Secretary must set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend these bylaws, the language of the proposed amendment), and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name and record address of the stockholder proposing such business and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made, (iii) the class, series and number of shares of the corporation that are owned beneficially and of record by the stockholder and such beneficial owner and a representation that the stockholder will notify the corporation in writing of the class and number of such shares owned beneficially and of record as of the record date for the meeting promptly following the later of the record date or the date notice of the record date is first publicly disclosed, (iv) any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, or similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to any class or series of shares of the corporation or with a value derived in whole or in part from the value of any class or series of shares of the corporation, whether or not such instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in the underlying class or series of capital stock of the corporation or otherwise (a Derivative Instrument) directly or indirectly owned beneficially by such stockholder and any other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the corporation and a representation that the stockholder will notify the corporation in writing of any such Derivative Instrument in effect as of the record date for the meeting promptly following the later of the record date or the date notice of the record date is first publicly disclosed, (v) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to the proposal of business between or among such stockholder and such beneficial owner, any of their respective affiliates or associates, and any others acting in concert with any of the foregoing and a representation that

Weston, Mass., October 25, 2012  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB) today announced third quarter 2012 financial results, delivering revenue growth of 6 percent to $1.4 billion and non-GAAP diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth of 19 percent.
Third Quarter 2012 Highlights:
 
 
 
 
As of September 30, 2012, Biogen Idec had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $3.3 billion.
"Through the first three quarters of 2012, Biogen Idec is on track to accomplish what we set out to do at the beginning of the year," said George A. Scangos, Ph.D., chief executive officer. "We have enhanced our leadership position in the multiple sclerosis market with strong results from AVONEX and TYSABRI; we have advanced our late-stage pipeline, with positive results from the registrational study for factor IX in hemophilia B; and we continue preparations for the potential launch of BG-12 next year. We look forward to data readouts for factor VIII in hemophilia A soon, followed by dexpramipexole in ALS and PEGylated interferon in relapsing MS in the coming months. Our hard work is reflected in this quarter's results."
TYSABRI Patient Growth
Based upon data available to us through the TOUCH prescribing program and other third party sources, as of the end of September 2012, we estimate that approximately 71,100 patients are on commercial and clinical TYSABRI therapy worldwide, and that cumulatively, approximately 108,300 patients have been treated with TYSABRI in the post-marketing setting.
Other Products and Royalty Revenues
Revenues from other products in the third quarter of 2012 were $28 million, compared to $17 million in the third quarter of 2011.

About AVONEX
AVONEX is one of the most prescribed treatments for relapsing forms of MS worldwide. AVONEX is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of MS to slow the accumulation of physical disability and decrease the frequency of clinical exacerbations. Patients with MS in whom efficacy has been demonstrated include patients who have experienced a first clinical episode and have MRI features consistent with MS.
Symptoms of depression, suicidal ideation, or psychosis, and cases of suicide, have been reported with increased frequency with patients receiving AVONEX. Severe hepatic injury, including cases of hepatic failure has been reported rarely in patients. Rare cases of anaphylaxis have been reported. While beta interferons do not have any known direct cardiac toxicity, cases of congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure have been reported in patients without known predisposition. Decreased peripheral blood counts have been reported from postmarketing experience. Seizures have been reported in patients using AVONEX, including patients with no prior history of seizure. Autoimmune disorders of multiple target organs have been reported. Routine periodic blood chemistry, hematology, liver function, and thyroid function tests are recommended. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. AVONEX should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. The most common side effects associated with AVONEX treatment are flu-like symptoms, including chills, fever, myalgia, and asthenia.
 
For additional important safety information, and the complete United States full prescribing information, please visit www.AVONEX.com.
About TYSABRI
TYSABRI is approved in more than 65 countries. TYSABRI is approved in the United States as a monotherapy for relapsing forms of MS, generally for patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, an alternative MS therapy. In the European Union, it is approved for highly active relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) in adult patients who have failed to respond to beta interferon or have rapidly evolving, severe RRMS.
TYSABRI has advanced the treatment of MS patients with its established efficacy. Data from the Phase 3 AFFIRM trial, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed that after two years, TYSABRI treatment led to a 68 percent relative reduction (p<0.001) in the annualized relapse rate when compared with placebo and reduced the relative risk of disability progression by 42-54 percent (p<0.001).
TYSABRI increases the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an opportunistic viral infection of the brain, which usually leads to death or severe disability. Infection by the JC virus (JCV) is required for the development of PML and patients who are anti-JCV antibody positive have a higher risk of developing PML. Factors that increase the risk of PML are presence of anti-JCV antibodies, prior immunosuppressant use, and longer TYSABRI treatment duration. Patients who have all three risk factors have the highest risk of developing PML. Other serious adverse events that have occurred in TYSABRI-treated patients include hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) and infections, including opportunistic and other atypical infections. Clinically significant liver injury has also been reported in the post-marketing setting. A list of adverse events can be found in the full TYSABRI product labeling for each country where it is approved.
TYSABRI is marketed and distributed by Biogen Idec Inc. and Elan Corporation, plc. For full prescribing information, including boxed warning and important safety information, and more information about TYSABRI, please visit or .

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis by providing additional measures which may be considered "non-GAAP" financial measures under applicable SEC rules. We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional insight into the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage our business internally, set operational goals and forms the basis of our management incentive programs. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted earnings per share.
Our "Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc." and "Non-GAAP earnings per shareDiluted" financial measures exclude the following items from GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted earnings per share:
1. Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments.
We exclude certain charges related to the 2003 merger between Biogen Inc. and Idec Pharmaceuticals, Inc., certain acquisition-related items, and certain amounts in relation to the consolidation of variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. These adjustments include charges for in-process research and development, the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets and adjustments to the fair value of our contingent consideration obligations. The exclusion of these charges provides management and investors with a supplemental measure of performance which the Company believes better reflects the underlying economics of the business.
2. Stock option expense recorded in accordance with the accounting standard for share-based payments.
We believe that excluding the impact of expensing stock options better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our business.
3. Other items.
We evaluate other items on an individual basis, and consider both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. We also include an adjustment to reflect the related tax effect of all reconciling items within our reconciliation of our GAAP to Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc.

Biogen Idec 2012 Revenue Increases 9% to $5.5 Billion
--2012 Non-GAAP Diluted EPS Rises 11% and GAAP Diluted EPS Up 14% --
-- Company Prepared for Second Quarter 2013 Launch of BG-12, under the Brand
Name, TECFIDERA
TM
--
-- Expecting Late 2013 Launch for both Long-Lasting Factor VIII & Factor IX --
Weston, MA, January 28, 2013 -- Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB) today announced full year and fourth quarter 2012 results.
As of December 31, 2012, Biogen Idec had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $3.7 billion.
"We recorded another solid year of revenue growth and profitability, all while advancing our late-stage pipeline and investing in upcoming product launches," said George A. Scangos, Ph.D., chief executive officer, for Biogen Idec. "We are poised to begin what we expect will be a remarkable period of growth, driven by our promising compounds including TECFIDERA and Peginterferon beta-1a for MS, and both Factor VIII and Factor IX for hemophilia. We appreciate the excitement that MS and hemophilia patients have expressed to us about these candidates, and our teams are well prepared to support the launches. We expect MS and hemophilia patients will benefit from these important new products for years to come."
Full Year 2012 Highlights:
Fourth Quarter 2012 Highlights:
Late Stage Pipeline Updates
On January 24, 2013, Biogen Idec released the primary efficacy analysis and safety data, from its Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial, ADVANCE. Results support peginterferon beta-1a as a potential treatment dosed every two weeks or every four weeks for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Peginterferon beta-1a is a new molecular entity in which interferon beta-1a is pegylated to extend its half-life and prolong its exposure in the body, enabling study of a less frequent dosing schedule. Based on the top-line data from the ADVANCE clinical trial, regulatory submissions in the United States and European Union are planned for peginterferon beta-1a in mid-2013.
On January 4, 2013, Biogen Idec announced the company recently submitted a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA for the marketing approval of recombinant factor IX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) for the treatment of hemophilia B. rFIXFc is the first product candidate in a new class of long-lasting clotting factor therapies that are being developed with the goals of reducing the burden of treatment for this condition and enhancing protection from bleeding. The regulatory submission was based on results from B-LONG, the largest registrational Phase 3 clinical study in hemophilia B to date.
On January 3, 2013, Biogen Idec reported top-line results of EMPOWER, a Phase 3 trial investigating dexpramipexole in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The trial did not meet its primary endpoint, a joint rank analysis of function and survival, and no efficacy was seen in the individual components of function or survival. The trial also failed to show efficacy in its key secondary endpoints. Additional analyses of multiple subpopulations failed to demonstrate any efficacy among these groups. Based on these results, Biogen Idec has discontinued development of dexpramipexole in ALS.
2013 Financial Guidance
Biogen Idec also announced its full year 2013 financial guidance. This guidance consists of the following components:
Biogen Idec may incur charges, realize gains or experience other events in 2013 that could cause actual results to vary from this guidance.
Our 2013 guidance reflects our belief in Biogen Idec's continued strong performance based on the strength of our core existing products and our anticipated product launches," said Paul Clancy, chief financial officer, for Biogen Idec. We are investing smartly to ensure our commercial operations are ready to support TECFIDERA, Factor VIII and Factor IX, and we will maintain our disciplined SG&A and R&D investments in 2013. This is an exciting time for all of us at Biogen Idec, as well as for patients and our shareholders.

BIOGEN IDEC TO ACQUIRE FULL RIGHTS AND CONTROL OF TYSABRI FROM ELAN FOR UPFRONT CASH AND CONTINGENT PAYMENTS
-- Biogen Idec gains all marketing, distribution and governance rights to TYSABRI in exchange for an upfront payment of $3.25Bn plus tiered contingent payments based on future TYSABRI worldwide sales --
-- Terminates TYSABRI collaboration agreement and eliminates change of control provision --
-- Transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to EPS --
Weston, Mass., February 6, 2013
-- Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB) today announced the company has agreed to purchase Elan's interest in TYSABRI (natalizumab) and upon closing will gain full strategic, commercial and decision-making rights to TYSABRI. Upon the closing of the transaction, the previous collaboration agreement between the companies, whereby worldwide TYSABRI profits were split 50/50, will be terminated along with the agreement's change of control provisions.
Under the terms of the agreement, Biogen Idec will use its existing cash reserves to make a payment of $3.25 billion to Elan upon the closing of the transaction and make future contingent payments to Elan in an amount equal to 12% of global net sales of TYSABRI for the first twelve months, and thereafter, Biogen Idec will continue to make contingent payments of 18% on annual global net sales of TYSABRI up to $2.0 billion and 25% on annual global net sales that exceed $2.0 billion. In 2014 only, the $2.0 billion threshold will be pro-rated for the portion of 2014 remaining after the first 12 months expires.
Biogen Idec anticipates the transaction will be approximately $0.20 to $0.30 accretive to 2013 GAAP earnings per share and $0.50 to $0.60 accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share, and will continue to be accretive thereafter, depending on the sales trajectory of TYSABRI.
This is a natural next step for Biogen Idec and TYSABRI, and it underscores our deep, long-term commitment to improving the lives of MS patients around the world, said George A. Scangos, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Biogen Idec. TYSABRI is a remarkably efficacious drug, and with the
increased awareness of our risk stratification capabilities, we believe MS patients' use of TYSABRI will continue to expand over the long-term. Full ownership will improve our ability to navigate its role as part of our leadership in MS. We appreciate Elan's tremendous partnership and the productive approach to our discussions that led to a transaction that benefits the shareholders of both companies. We expect a smooth transition to the closing of the transaction.
The transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is subject to the customary review process under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act in the United States and other customary review processes. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter, assuming a standard regulatory approval timeframe.
Centerview Partners LLC is acting as exclusive financial advisor to Biogen Idec. Ropes & Gray LLP is acting as legal counsel to Biogen Idec.

About TYSABRI
TYSABRI is approved in more than 65 countries. TYSABRI is approved in the United States as a monotherapy for relapsing forms of MS, generally for patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, an alternative MS therapy. In the European Union, it is approved for highly active relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) in adult patients who have failed to respond to beta interferon or have rapidly evolving, severe RRMS.
TYSABRI has advanced the treatment of MS patients with its established efficacy. Data from the Phase 3 AFFIRM trial, which was published in the
New England Journal of Medicine
, showed that after two years, TYSABRI treatment led to a 68 percent relative reduction (p<0.001) in the annualized relapse rate when compared with placebo and reduced the relative risk of disability progression by 42-54 percent (p<0.001).
TYSABRI increases the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an opportunistic viral infection of the brain which usually leads to death or severe disability. Infection by the JC virus (JCV) is required for the development of PML and patients who are anti-JCV antibody positive have a higher risk of developing PML. Factors that increase the risk of PML are presence of anti-JCV antibodies, prior immunosuppressant use, and longer TYSABRI treatment duration. Patients who have all three risk factors have the highest risk of developing PML. Other serious adverse events that have occurred in TYSABRI-treated patients include hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) and infections, including opportunistic and other atypical infections. Clinically significant liver injury has also been reported in the post-marketing setting. A list of adverse events can be found in the full TYSABRI product labeling for each country where it is approved.
TYSABRI is marketed and distributed by Biogen Idec Inc. and Elan Corporation, plc. For full prescribing information and more information about TYSABRI, please visit

(interferon beta-1a), TYSABRI and RITUXAN
(rituximab), the importance of TYSABRI's sales growth, uncertainty of success in commercializing and developing other products, product competition, the occurrence of adverse safety events with our products, changes in the availability of reimbursement for our products, adverse market and economic conditions, our dependence on collaborations and other third parties over which we may not always have full control, problems with our manufacturing processes and our reliance on third parties, failure to comply with government regulation, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and have sufficient rights to market our products together with the cost of doing so, the risks of doing business internationally, failure to manage our growth and execute our growth initiatives, charges and other costs relating to our properties, fluctuations in our effective tax rate, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, product liability claims, fluctuations in our operating results, the market, interest and credit risks associated with our portfolio of marketable securities, environmental risks and the other risks and uncertainties that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual or quarterly report and in other reports we have filed with the SEC.
These statements are based on our current beliefs and expectations and speak only as of the date of this press release. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our estimate of the transaction's effect on non-GAAP earnings per share excludes the impact of our projected amortization of the upfront cash payment and related amounts and the income tax effect related to such amortization.  We believe that the disclosure of this non-GAAP estimate provides additional insight into the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage our business internally, set operational goals and forms the basis of our management incentive programs.

22
item(s), which Biogen Idec may, but is not required to, accept.
(b)
    
Within sixty (60) days after the Execution Date, but in any event no later than the Closing Date (or with respect to any item later added to the Asset Schedules in accordance with Section 3.4(a), at the time such item is added), Elan shall provide Biogen Idec with a true, correct and complete copy of any Regulatory Materials, In-License or Contractual Right listed on

At such time Elan shall also describe in writing, with respect to each item included on the Asset Schedules, any required consent or other impediment to the transfer of such item to Biogen Idec or any Affiliate pursuant to this Agreement.
(c)
    
Elan shall promptly provide additional due diligence information with respect to each item listed on the Asset Schedules as Biogen Idec may reasonably request. Elan shall supply such information as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within fifteen (15) days of Biogen Idecs written request therefor.
(d)
    
Within thirty (30) days after the Execution Date (or with respect to any Regulatory Materials, Contractual Right or In-License Elan later added to the Asset Schedules in accordance with Section 3.4(a), thirty (30) days after such item was added) or, if later, thirty (30) days after receipt of a true, complete and correct copy of the applicable Regulatory Materials, Contractual Right or In-License, Biogen Idec may provide (including after the Closing) written notice to Elan that it desires to exclude any Regulatory Materials, Contractual Right or In-License listed thereon from the Transferred Assets (each such notice, an 
Exclusion Notice
).
3.5.
    
Consents
. Elan shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use, both prior to and after the Closing Date, commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, and Biogen Idec shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to assist and cooperate with Elan and its Affiliates in connection therewith, all necessary consents to the assignment and transfer of any Transferred Asset to Biogen Idec (and the subsequent assignment by and transfer from Biogen Idec to any of its designated Affiliates, in Biogen Idecs sole discretion) that is not assignable or transferable without the consent of any Third Party (such consents, the 
Required Third Party Consents
). With respect to any such Transferred Asset, after the Closing Date and until the requisite consent is obtained and the foregoing is transferred and assigned to Biogen Idec or an Affiliate, Elan, to the extent permitted by applicable law, shall (or shall cause its Affiliates to) provide to Biogen Idec or its Affiliates, at no cost or expense, the benefits thereof (or substantially comparable benefits) and shall enforce, at the request of and for the account of Biogen Idec or its Affiliate, any rights of Elan or its Affiliates arising thereunder against any Third Party, including the right to elect to terminate in accordance with the terms thereof upon the advice of Biogen Idec. If Biogen Idec or its Affiliate is provided with benefits of any such Transferred Asset, then, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and the terms of any applicable Contractual Right or Regulatory Approval, Biogen Idec shall, or shall cause its Affiliate to, perform, at the request of Elan, the obligations of Elan thereunder.
3.6.
    
Due Diligence
. Elan shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly provide to Biogen Idec such information as Biogen Idec or its Affiliates may reasonably request with respect
23
to the Alpha-4 Integrin Products, JCV Assays or Transferred Assets, before and after the Closing. Elan shall permit Biogen Idec and its Affiliates to have access (at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice) to all relevant employees of Elan and to all of the Transferred Assets and to make copies as Biogen Idec may reasonably request.
3.7.
    
Regulatory Cooperation
. Elan shall notify the appropriate Regulatory Authorities and take any other action reasonably necessary to effect the transfer of ownership of the Regulatory Materials. Elan shall notify and consult with Biogen Idec or its designated Affiliate promptly after receipt of any communication between Elan and any Regulatory Authority with respect to any such transfer, and before giving any submission to any Regulatory Authority with respect to any such transfer. If ownership of any Regulatory Materials cannot be transferred to Biogen Idec in any country, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Elan hereby grants to Biogen Idec and its designated Affiliates a permanent, exclusive and irrevocable right of access and reference to such Regulatory Materials for Alpha-4 Integrin Products and JCV Assays in such country. If such right of access and reference is not sufficient to permit Biogen Idec and its Affiliates to file a Drug Approval Application and receive Regulatory Approval or to Develop, make, market, use or sell an Alpha-4 Integrin Product or JCV Assay, Elan shall provide Biogen Idec and its designated Affiliates with the complete data package that Elan used in regulatory submissions in such country in order to allow Biogen Idec and its Affiliates to file such Drug Approval Applications and to receive Regulatory Approval in its own name. In addition, if in any country the transfer of the Regulatory Approval necessary for Biogen Idec or its designated Affiliate to commercialize TYSABRI in such country is not (or is not expected to be) effective on the Closing Date, then the Parties will work together in good faith to enter into a promotion agreement (in a mutually agreed form of a distribution, agency or other arrangement) that would permit Biogen Idec or its designated Affiliate the exclusive right to commercialize TYSABRI in the applicable country from and after the Closing until such Regulatory Approval is transferred.
3.8.
    
Transfer of Inventory
. On the Closing Date, Elan Inc. shall consummate the sale of the Transferred Inventory by delivering possession of the Transferred Inventory to Biogen Idec or to its Affiliate designated to purchase and/or receive the Transferred Inventory.

Transfer of Know-How and Books and Records
. As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing and in accordance with the Transition Plan, Elan shall deliver to Biogen Idec or its designated Affiliate, in electronic or hard copy format, the Elan Know-how and the Books and Records. If any of the embodiments of the Elan Know-how or any of the Books and Records contain proprietary information of Elan that is not Elan Know-how, then Elan shall be permitted to redact such information prior to delivering such embodiment or such Books and Records to Biogen Idec or its designated Affiliate.
3.10.
    
Transition
.
(a)
    
In order to effect an orderly transition of all Development and Commercialization activities to Biogen Idec and to facilitate the transfer of the Transferred Assets and other rights assigned or licensed to Biogen Idec under this Agreement: (i) Elan shall make its personnel, and shall cause its Affiliates to make their personnel, available to Biogen Idec and its designated Affiliates as reasonably requested by Biogen Idec from time
24
to time; (ii) the Parties agree to comply with the provisions of the Transition Plan, which is attached hereto as

As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing (and, in any event, no later than twenty (20) Business Days after the Closing Date), Elan shall return to Biogen Idec any and all proprietary materials transferred by Biogen Idec to Elan pursuant to Section 4.9 of the Collaboration Agreement.
(e)
    
After the Closing, Elan shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, without the prior consent of Biogen Idec (which consent shall be granted in Biogen Idecs sole discretion) terminate any TYSABRI Employee other than for Cause prior to the completion of the transition and transfer activities contemplated by this Agreement (including the Transition Plan) with respect to which such TYSABRI Employee has or had relevant experience or knowledge. For purposes of this Agreement, 
Cause
 shall mean, with respect to a TYSABRI Employee, any of the following: (i) willful breach, habitual neglect, or poor performance of such TYSABRI Employees job duties and responsibilities, as determined by Elan in its sole discretion; (ii) such TYSABRI Employees conviction (or the entry of a guilty plea or plea of nolo contendre) of any crime, excluding minor traffic offenses; (iii) commission of an act of dishonesty or breach of fiduciary duty by such TYSABRI Employee; (iv) commission of a material violation of any of the personnel policies of Elan by such TYSABRI Employee, including but not limited to, violations of Elans confidentiality or stock trading policies or its policies against any form of harassment; or (v) any action or omission by such TYSABRI Employee, which, as reasonably determined by Elan, is contrary to the business interest, reputation or goodwill of Elan.

(b)
    
To the extent Elan cannot transfer and assign any of the Transferred Intellectual Property, or any portion thereof, as of the Closing, then Elan will assign and
25
transfer such Transferred Intellectual Property at the first opportunity to do so. To the extent further transfer or assignment of any Transferred Intellectual Property is required and Elan has not executed and returned the form of assignment reasonably requested by Biogen Idec to Biogen Idec within twenty (20) Business Days of the delivery of such assignment to Elan, then Elan hereby irrevocably appoints Biogen Idec as its attorney-in-fact with the right, authority and ability to execute and enter into such assignment on behalf of Elan. Elan stipulates and agrees that such appointment is a right coupled with an interest and will survive the incapacity or unavailability of Elan at any future time. To the extent that any Transferred Intellectual Property cannot be assigned and transferred by Elan, then Elan hereby grants Biogen Idec an irrevocable, worldwide, fully-paid up, royalty-free, exclusive license, with the right to sublicense, to make, use, sell, improve, reproduce, distribute, perform, display, transmit, manipulate in any manner, create derivative works based upon, and otherwise exploit or utilize in any manner the Transferred Intellectual Property. In addition, Elan hereby releases, discharges, and covenants not to assert against Biogen Idec and its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, contractors, customers, agents, representatives, assignees, licensees, partners, joint venturers, and distributors all claims, causes, obligations, rights of action, or liabilities of any kind or nature, whether now existing or hereinafter arising, and whether known or unknown arising from or relating to Transferred Intellectual Property.
(c)
    
Elan will not take any action that is designed or intended to have the effect of discouraging any licensor, supplier, distributor, independent contractor or customer of Elan or other Third Party with whom Elan has a relationship relating to any Alpha-4 Integrin Product or JCV Assay from maintaining the same relationship with Biogen Idec and its Affiliates after the Closing as such Third Party maintained prior to the Closing or from entering into a new business relationship or expanding the scope of a business relationship with Biogen Idec and its Affiliates. Elan will refer all customer and other Third Party inquiries relating to Alpha-4 Integrin Products and JCV Assays to Biogen Idec from and after the Closing Date.
(d)
    
From and after the Closing Date, Biogen Idec shall afford to Elan and its accountants, counsel and other representatives reasonable access, upon reasonable notice during normal business hours, to all Books and Records as Elan may reasonably request for purposes of tax, accounting, regulatory and legal compliance or for purposes of prosecuting or defending litigation.
(e)
    
Before and after the Closing, each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, to cooperate with and provide the other Party, and its Affiliates, such information as the other Party may reasonably request with respect to preparing any securities filings or public disclosures that may be required to be made by the other Party or any of its Affiliates in connection with the Transactions.
(f)
    
If, at any time, either Party determines that any right, title or interest in, to or under any Patent, Know-how or other Intellectual Property was transferred by Elan to any Prothena Group Company prior to the Closing and such Patent, Know-how or other Intellectual Property would have been Transferred Intellectual Property under this
26
Agreement had such Patent, Know-how or other Intellectual Property been Controlled by Elan on the Execution Date or Closing Date (such Patent, Know-how or other Intellectual Property, the 
Improperly Transferred Prothena IP
), Elan shall, at its own expense, use commercially reasonable efforts to exercise any rights granted to Elan under any agreement between Elan and such Prothena Group Company to acquire any right, title or interest in, to or under such Improperly Transferred Prothena IP to acquire from such Prothena Group Company any right, title or interest in, to or under such Improperly Transferred Prothena IP reasonably requested by Biogen Idec, and Elan shall transfer and assign to Biogen Idec any such rights, title and interests acquired from such Prothena Group Company for no additional consideration. If (i) Elan is unable to acquire from such Prothena Group Company any right, title or interest in, to or under such Improperly Transferred Prothena IP reasonably requested by Biogen Idec and (ii) Biogen Idec subsequently acquires such right, title or interest, Elan will reimburse Biogen Idec for all reasonable cost and expenses incurred by Biogen Idec in such acquisition. This Section 3.11(f) shall not apply to the licenses granted by Elan to Neotope Biosciences Limited pursuant to the Intellectual Property License and Conveyance Agreement among Neotope Biosciences Limited, Elan and Elan Inc., dated as of December 20, 2012, and the Amended and Restated Intellectual Property License and Contribution Agreement among Neotope Biosciences Limited, Elan and Elan Inc., dated as of December 20, 2012, to use antibodies 6F10, 5E10, 5D8 and 8G9, which specifically bind ELND-002, solely for research purposes relating to certain research projects defined in such agreements (such licenses, the 
Excluded Prothena Licenses
).
(g)
    
If, at any time, either Party determines that any Patent or other Intellectual Property (other than Know-how) that is necessary or useful to, or any Know-how that is necessary to, Develop, make, have made, use, market, sell, distribute, export, import, offer for sale, have sold, or distributed or imported any Alpha-4 Integrin Product or JCV Assay, or that relates to PML or JCV, was discovered, developed, conceived or reduced to practice prior to the Closing pursuant to or in connection with any agreement between Elan and any Prothena Group Company, and such Patent, Know-how or other Intellectual Property was not included in the Transferred Intellectual Property assigned to Biogen Idec at the Closing (such Patent, Know-how or other Intellectual Property, the 
Blocking Prothena IP
), then Elan shall, at its own expense, use commercially reasonable efforts to exercise any rights granted to Elan under any agreement between Elan and such Prothena Group Company to acquire any right, title or interest in, to or under such Blocking Prothena IP to acquire from such Prothena Group Company any right, title or interest in, to or under such Blocking Prothena IP reasonably requested by Biogen Idec, and Elan shall transfer and assign to Biogen Idec any such rights, title and interests acquired from such Prothena Group Company for no additional consideration. If (i) Elan is unable to acquire from such Prothena Group Company any right, title or interest in, to or under such Blocking Prothena IP reasonably requested by Biogen Idec and (ii) Biogen Idec subsequently acquires such right, title or interest, Elan will reimburse Biogen Idec for all reasonable cost and expenses incurred by Biogen Idec in such acquisition. This Section 3.11(g) shall not apply to the Excluded Prothena Licenses.
(h)
    
Elan hereby assigns to Biogen Idec, as of the Closing and to the extent
27
permitted by applicable law, all of Elans rights under any confidentiality, proprietary information and/or invention agreement, or any similar agreement, between Elan and any TYSABRI Employee, including the TYSABRI Employees set forth on
Schedule 3.11(h)
, with respect to any Alpha-4 Integrin Product Confidential Information, any Transferred Intellectual Property or any Patent, Know-how or other Intellectual Property that would have been Transferred Intellectual Property under this Agreement if it had been Controlled by Elan on Closing Date;
provided
,
however
, that, if the assignment of any such rights is not permitted by applicable law, Elan shall, at the request of Biogen Idec, enforce such rights for the benefit of Biogen Idec. Biogen Idec shall reimburse Elan for any costs and expenses that Elan incurs with respect to enforcing such rights for the benefit Biogen Idec;
provided
,
however
, that if such enforcement is necessary because of Elans negligence prior to the Closing, Elan shall bear such costs and expenses.
4.1.
    
Upfront Payment
. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Biogen Idec shall make a one-time payment to Elan at the Closing of three billion, two hundred forty-nine million dollars ($3,249,000,000) plus the Estimated Closing Date Inventory Value set forth in the statement referred to in the first sentence of Section 4.8 (together, the 
Upfront Payment
), which payment shall be irrevocable, non-refundable and non-creditable toward any other payments due to Elan.
4.2.
    
Contingent Payments
.
(a)
    
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Biogen Idec or its designated Affiliates shall pay to Elan, with respect to aggregate Net Sales in all countries in the Territory during the twelve (12) month period beginning on the first day of the first full calendar month after the Closing Date (the 
Initial Contingent Payment Period
), twelve percent (12%) of aggregate Net Sales during such period in all countries in the Territory.
(b)
    
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Biogen Idec or its designated Affiliates shall pay to Elan, with respect to aggregate Net Sales in all countries in the Territory during the period (if any) beginning on the first day after the end of the Initial Contingent Payment Period and ending on December 31, 2014, the following amounts:
(c)
    
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Biogen Idec or its designated Affiliates shall pay to Elan, with respect to aggregate Net Sales in all countries in the Territory during calendar year 2015 and each calendar year thereafter in the Term, the
28
following amounts:
By way of example only, if the Net Sales in calendar year 2015 were $2.5 billion, the amount owed pursuant to this Section 4.2(c) would be the sum of (A) 18% of $2.0 billion (or $360 million) and (B) 25% of $500 million (or $125 million), for a total of $485 million.
(d)
    
For purposes of Section 4.2(b) and Section 4.2(c), 
Threshold
 shall mean:
(e)
    
For purposes of this Agreement, 
Contingent Payments
 shall mean the
29
payments payable to Elan under Section 4.2. No Contingent Payments will be payable with respect to sales between or among Biogen Idec and its Affiliates.
(f)
    
If, during the Term, Biogen Idec reasonably determines in good faith that, in order to avoid infringement of any Patent of any Third Party, it is necessary to (i) obtain a license from such Third Party in order for Biogen Idec or any of its Affiliates, distributors or licensees to make, have made, use, market, sell, distribute, export, import, offer for sale, or have sold, distributed or imported, TYSABRI in any country in the Territory and (ii) pay royalties or other monetary consideration to such Third Party under such license, then the Contingent Payments shall be reduced by an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the amount payable by Biogen Idec or its Affiliate to such Third Party under such license, but only to the extent that such amount is paid in consideration of a license to make, have made, use, market, sell, distribute, export, import, offer for sale, or have sold, distributed or imported TYSABRI. Any such amounts that Biogen Idec is not able to reduce in a Calendar Quarter will be carried forward for reductions against Contingent Payments in subsequent Calendar Quarters. For the sake of clarity, the Contingent Payments shall not be reduced pursuant to this Section 4.2(f) with respect to any amounts paid by Biogen Idec or its Affiliate to a Third Party under the Transferred License Agreements or any licenses held by Biogen Idec or its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date.
(g)
    
[Intentionally omitted.
]
(h)
    
If, during the Term, Elan challenges under any court Action, or before any patent office, in any country in the Territory, the validity, patentability, enforceability, scope or non-infringement of any Elan Patent or any other Patent Controlled by Biogen Idec or any of its Affiliates that (i) claims an Alpha-4 Integrin Product or any uses of Alpha-4 Integrin Products, (ii) claims a JCV Assay or any uses of a JCV Assay, or (iii) otherwise relates to PML or JCV, or initiates a reexamination of any such Patent, or assists any Third Party to conduct any of the foregoing activities (each, a 
Challenge
), then the Net Sales in such country shall thereafter be excluded from the calculation of the Contingent Payments. Elan will notify Biogen Idec at least thirty (30) days prior to initiating any such Challenge.
4.3.
    
Payment Terms
.
(a)
    
Biogen Idec or its designated Affiliates shall make Contingent Payments to Elan with respect to each Calendar Quarter within sixty (60) days after the end of such Calendar Quarter, and each such Contingent Payment shall be accompanied by a report identifying the Net Sales for such Calendar Quarter and the amount payable to Elan. All Contingent Payments not made when due shall bear interest, calculated from the date such Contingent Payment was due, at the rate of two percent (2%) over the prime rate of interest as published in the weekly Federal Reserve H.15 Bulletin, or any successor bulletin thereto. Biogen Idec shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of each calendar year, recalculate the Contingent Payments for such calendar year based on changes to Net Sales that arose as a result of the preparation of the audited financial statements for Biogen Idec and its Affiliates for such calendar year and issue a final report to Elan for such calendar year. If the amount of the Contingent Payments for such calendar year as recalculated exceeds
30
the amount of Contingent Payments actually paid by Biogen Idec pursuant to Section 4.2 for such calendar year, Biogen Idec will pay Elan the amount of such excess as soon as reasonably practicable. If the amount of the Contingent Payments for such calendar year actually paid by Biogen Idec pursuant to Section 4.2 exceeds the amount of Contingent Payments as recalculated, the amount of such excess will be applied against the payment of the next Contingent Payment thereafter until such excess has been applied in full.
(b)
    
If Net Sales in any Calendar Quarter during the Term are less than zero (as a result of returns or recalls of TYSABRI or any other circumstance), then Biogen Idec will not be obligated to make Contingent Payments to Elan for such Calendar Quarter, and for purposes of calculating Contingent Payments with respect to the fourth Calendar Quarter of such year, Net Sales for such fourth Calendar Quarter shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of negative Net Sales in each Calendar Quarter of such year in which Net Sales are less than zero. If, as a result of such reduction, the aggregate Net Sales with respect to such fourth Calendar Quarter are less than zero, then, for purposes of calculating Contingent Payments with respect to the first Calendar Quarter of the next succeeding year, Net Sales for such first Calendar Quarter shall be reduced by the amount of negative Net Sales in the fourth Calendar Quarter of the immediately preceding year.
(c)
    
Each payment under this Agreement shall be made by electronic transfer in immediately available funds via either a bank wire transfer, an ACH (automated clearing house) mechanism, or any other means of electronic funds transfer, at Biogen Idecs election, to such bank account as Elan shall designate in a notice at least five (5) Business Days before the payment is due.
(d)
    
All payments due under this Agreement shall be made in United States dollars. Whenever, for the purposes of calculating Contingent Payments, conversion from any foreign currency will be required, all amounts will first be calculated in the currency of sale and then converted into United States dollars by applying the monthly average rate of exchange calculated by using the foreign exchange rates published in Bloomberg during the applicable month starting two (2) Business Days before the beginning of such month and ending two (2) Business Days before the end of such month as utilized by Biogen Idec, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, fairly applied and as employed on a consistent basis throughout Biogen Idecs operations.

No single or partial exercise of any right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce any right or power, shall preclude any other or further exercise of any right or power under this Agreement or the exercise of any other right or power.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On March 14, 2013, Biogen Idec Inc. (the 
Company
) entered into a Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, and the lenders party thereto (the 
Credit Agreement
). The Credit Agreement provides for a $750 million unsecured, revolving credit facility (the 
Revolving Credit Facility
). 
The closing date and the obligation of the lenders to make an initial credit extension under the Revolving Credit Facility will automatically occur upon the Company's (or its affiliates') receipt of all regulatory approvals required to complete the acquisition of all applicable strategic, commercial, decision-making and intellectual property rights to TYSABRI (natalizumab) from Elan Pharma International Limited and Elan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. pursuant to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of February 5, 2013 (the 
Acquisition Agreement
), and the provision of certain certificates by the Company to the administrative agent.  The Company has received all regulatory approvals required to complete the acquisition under the Acquisition Agreement.
The commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility will automatically terminate if (i) the closing date does not occur on or before 120 days after March 14, 2013, (ii) the Acquisition Agreement is terminated or expires in accordance with its terms prior to the closing date, or (iii) the Company or its affiliates receive the required regulatory approvals to complete the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement and fail to notify the Administrative Agent within a specified period of time after receipt of such required regulatory approvals.  
Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are available for general corporate purposes and for other permitted purposes set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Company is not borrowing under the Credit Agreement at this time, but may borrow under the Credit Agreement from time to time as opportunities and needs arise.  
At the Company's option, revolving loans under the Credit Agreement (other than swing line loans) will bear interest at rate equal to (a) a Eurodollar Rate - the British Bankers Association London Inter-Bank Offered Rate for dollar deposits (
LIBOR
) plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.875% to 2.00% depending on the ratings of the Company's non-credit enhanced, senior unsecured long-term debt, as determined by either Standard & Poor's or Moody's (the 
Debt Ratings
) or (b) a Base Rate equal to the higher of (i) the Bank of America prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% and (iii) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.00%, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0% to 1.00% based on the Company's Debt Ratings (the 
Base Rate
). Swing line loans will bear interest at the Base Rate plus the applicable margin for Base Rate loans.
Payments of the principal amounts of revolving loans under the Credit Agreement are due no later than 364 days from the closing date.  Under the Revolving Credit Facility, voluntary prepayments are permitted, in whole or in part, in minimum amounts without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs with respect to Eurodollar Rate borrowings. The Revolving Credit Facility requires quarterly interest payments or, in the case of Eurodollar Rate loans, at the end of the interest period therefor, with the principal due on the maturity date.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The Credit Agreement also includes a financial covenant requiring the Company to maintain, measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter, a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.5 to 1.0.
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
The information included in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.
SIGNATURES
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

BIOGEN IDEC COMPLETES PURCHASE OF FULL RIGHTS AND CONTROL OF TYSABRI
Weston, Mass., April 2, 2013
-- Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB) today announced it has completed its purchase of Elan Corporation's interest in TYSABRI
(natalizumab) and has gained full strategic, commercial and decision-making rights to TYSABRI. The transaction was originally announced on February 6, 2013.
Full ownership of TYSABRI is an important step for Biogen Idec that further solidifies our leadership in MS, said George A. Scangos, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Biogen Idec. The powerful efficacy of TYSABRI makes it an important treatment for many people living with MS and we believe it has a solid growth trajectory for years to come. We are grateful to Elan for more than a decade of collaboration on TYSABRI, and for their work to provide a seamless transition as we finalized the transaction.
Further details and updated financial guidance will be provided during Biogen Idec's upcoming first quarter 2013 earnings announcement.
For more than two decades Biogen Idec has been a leader in multiple sclerosis (MS), offering a wide range of therapies, unsurpassed patient support, and a robust R&D program to improve the lives of people with MS. Biogen Idec also has the deepest MS pipeline in the industry with compounds that include PLEGRIDY (peginterferon beta-1a); daclizumab high-yield process (DAC HYP) for monthly subcutaneous administration; and an ongoing study with TYSABRI as a treatment for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). 
About TYSABRI
TYSABRI is approved in more than 65 countries. TYSABRI is approved in the United States as a monotherapy for relapsing forms of MS, generally for patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, an alternative MS therapy due to the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). In the European Union, it is approved for highly active relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) in adult patients who have failed to respond to beta interferon or have rapidly evolving, severe RRMS.
TYSABRI has advanced the treatment of MS patients with its established efficacy. Data from the Phase 3 AFFIRM trial, which was published in the
New England Journal of Medicine
, showed that after two years, TYSABRI treatment led to a 68 percent relative reduction (p<0.001) in the annualized relapse rate when compared with placebo and reduced the relative risk of disability progression by 42-54 percent (p<0.001).
TYSABRI increases the risk of PML, an opportunistic viral infection of the brain which usually leads to death or severe disability. Infection by the JC virus (JCV) is required for the development of PML and patients who are anti-JCV antibody positive have a higher risk of developing PML. Factors that increase the risk of PML are presence of anti-JCV antibodies, prior immunosuppressant use, and longer TYSABRI treatment duration. Patients who have all three risk factors have the highest risk of developing PML. Other serious adverse events that have occurred in TYSABRI-treated patients include hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) and infections, including opportunistic and other atypical infections. Clinically significant liver injury has also been reported in the post-marketing setting. A list of adverse events can be found in the full TYSABRI product labeling for each country where it is approved.
As a result of the acquisition from Elan, TYSABRI will be marketed and distributed solely by Biogen Idec. For full prescribing information and more information about TYSABRI, please visit

Biogen Idec Total Revenues Increased 10% to $1.4 Billion in First Quarter 2013
-- First Quarter Non-GAAP Diluted EPS Rose 41% and GAAP Diluted EPS Up 43% --
-- TECFIDERA (Dimethyl Fumarate) Approved and Launched in the US as a First-Line Oral Treatment for Relapsing Forms of Multiple Sclerosis; EU Approval Pending --
-- Gained Full Strategic, Commercial and Decision-Making Rights to TYSABRI
--
Weston, MA, April 25, 2013 --
Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB) today reported first quarter 2013 total revenues of $1.4 billion, an increase of 10% compared to the first quarter of 2012. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the first quarter of 2013 were $1.97, an increase of 41% over the first quarter of 2012. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec for the first quarter 2013 was $469 million, an increase of 39% versus the first quarter of 2012.
First quarter 2013 GAAP diluted EPS were $1.79, an increase of 43% versus the first quarter of 2012. GAAP net income for the first quarter was $427 million, an increase of 41% versus the first quarter of 2012. A reconciliation of our GAAP to Non-GAAP results is attached to this press release.
Revenue gains were led by the performance of our marketed therapies: AVONEX
(interferon beta-1a) with revenues increasing 13% year-over-year to $746 million; and TYSABRI
(natalizumab) with revenues increasing 9% year-over-year to $312 million. RITUXAN
(rituximab) revenues from our unconsolidated joint business arrangement were $265 million for the quarter, a decrease of 7% from the prior year.
2013 is off to an exciting start for Biogen Idec and the patients we serve, said George A. Scangos, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer. We achieved several milestones that expand our leadership in supporting people living with MS, including the launch of TECFIDERA
TM
(dimethyl fumarate) in the US, acquisition of full rights and control of TYSABRI and a positive phase 3 trial for PLEGRIDY
TM
(Peginterferon beta-1a) in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.
We also are preparing for the potential launches in 2014 of our long-lasting clotting factor therapies for hemophilia, rFVIIIFc and rFIXFc, he continued. We believe these therapies have the potential to transform the standard of care for hemophilia patients around the world. Our entire organization is aligned behind our focused mission and executing well in every aspect of the business - from launching new products to advancing our deep early-stage pipeline.
Other Financial Highlights
2013 Financial Guidance
Biogen Idec updated its full year 2013 financial guidance. This guidance consists of the following components:
Biogen Idec may incur charges, realize gains or experience other events in 2013 that could cause actual results to vary from this guidance.
In the first quarter, we continued to drive solid performance while making substantial progress moving our late-stage programs towards approvals and launch, said Paul J. Clancy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Notably, we delivered solid EPS growth, continued to make disciplined R&D investments, focused on building our MS franchise, and were able to increase our outlook for the year. We expect to continue our strong performance throughout 2013.
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Franchise Highlights
TECFIDERA (dimethyl fumarate)
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) approved TECFIDERA on March 27, 2013, as a new first-line oral treatment for people living with relapsing forms of MS. TECFIDERA is now available to MS patients across the United States.
On March 22, 2013, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued a positive opinion recommending that the European Commission (EC) provide marketing authorization for TECFIDERA in the European Union as a first-line oral treatment for adults with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The EC decision on TECFIDERA is expected in the second quarter of 2013.
On March 19, 2013, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a patent for the TECFIDERA dosing regimen of 480 mg daily. This patent, which expires in 2028, adds to the growing portfolio of patents covering TECFIDERA. The European Patent Office also recently determined that Biogen Idec's application for a patent covering the same dosing regimen of TECFIDERA is allowable. Once granted, this patent would also expire in 2028.
TYSABRI (natalizumab)
TYSABRI revenues increased 9% year-over-year to $312 million.
Global in-market sales of TYSABRI in the first quarter of 2013 were $456 million, an increase of 15% over the first quarter of 2012. The total was comprised of $257 million in U.S. sales and $199 million in sales outside the U.S.
On April 2, 2013, Biogen Idec completed its purchase of Elan's interest in TYSABRI and gained full strategic, commercial and decision-making rights to the product. Biogen Idec used its cash resources to make a payment of $3.25 billion to Elan. Subject to the terms of the agreement with Elan, the Company and Elan will continue to share TYSABRI profits equally through April 30, 2013. Commencing May 1, 2013 and for the first twelve months thereafter, the Company will make future contingent payments to Elan in an amount equal to 12% of global net sales of TYSABRI, and thereafter, Biogen Idec will continue to make contingent payments of 18% on annual global net sales of TYSABRI up to $2.0 billion and 25% on annual global net sales that exceed $2.0 billion. In 2014 only, the $2.0 billion threshold will be pro-rated for the portion of 2014 remaining after the completion of the first twelve months of contingent payments.
 
On March 18, 2013, Biogen Idec and Elan announced results from several studies of TYSABRI that demonstrate its efficacy compared to other MS treatments, provide additional data supporting anti-JC virus (JCV) antibody status stability, and suggest better outcomes when progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is detected early. These data were presented at the 65th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) held in San Diego, CA in March 2013.
Based on data available to us through the TOUCH
prescribing program and other third-party sources, as of the end of March 2013, the Company estimates that approximately 73,600 patients were on commercial and clinical TYSABRI therapy worldwide, and that cumulatively, approximately 115,400 patients have been treated with TYSABRI in the post-marketing setting.
AVONEX (interferon beta-1a)
AVONEX revenues increased 13% year-over-year to $746 million. AVONEX remains one of the most prescribed treatments for relapsing forms of MS worldwide and continued to gain market share during the first quarter within the injectable segment of the MS market place. The AVONEX PEN auto-injector, a dosing innovation designed to improve the treatment experience for patients receiving once-a-week AVONEX, has now been commercially launched in 27 countries.
Additional Pipeline Development Highlights
During the first quarter Biogen Idec achieved a number of milestones toward the development of its hemophilia program:
On January 24, 2013, Biogen Idec announced positive, full first-year results from its two-year pivotal Phase 3 ADVANCE study of PLEGRIDY, the Company's investigational candidate for RRMS. If approved, PLEGRIDY will be dosed once every two weeks and we believe has the potential to be a preferred option in the injectable class of MS treatments. We will be submitting our regulatory applications to the FDA and EMA by mid-2013, for potential approval in 2014.
During March 16 through March 23, 2013, Biogen Idec presented more than 50 company-sponsored platform and poster presentations on data supporting its multiple-marketed and pipeline therapies for neurological diseases at the AAN Annual Meeting in San Diego. Biogen Idec presented notable data on several programs including: TECFIDERA, TYSABRI, AVONEX, PLEGRIDY, daclizumab high-yield process, and anti-LINGO.
On April 4, 2013, Biogen Idec announced results from the daclizumab high-yield process (DAC HYP) SELECT clinical trial were published in an on-line article in
The Lancet
. SELECT was a Phase 2b registrational study designed to determine the efficacy and safety of DAC HYP in patients with RRMS.
Conference Call and Webcast
The Company's earnings conference call for the first quarter will be broadcast via the internet at 8:00 a.m. EDT on April 25, 2013, and will be accessible through the Investors section of Biogen Idec's homepage, www.biogenidec.com. Supplemental information in the form of a slide presentation will also be accessible at the same location on the internet at the time of the conference call and will be subsequently available on the website for one month.

About AVONEX
AVONEX is one of the most prescribed treatments for relapsing forms of MS worldwide. AVONEX is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of MS to slow the accumulation of physical disability and decrease the frequency of clinical exacerbations. Patients with MS in whom efficacy has been demonstrated include patients who have experienced a first clinical episode and have MRI features consistent with MS.
Symptoms of depression, suicidal ideation, or psychosis, and cases of suicide, have been reported with increased frequency with patients receiving AVONEX. Severe hepatic injury, including cases of hepatic failure has been reported rarely in patients. Rare cases of anaphylaxis have been reported. While beta interferons do not have any known direct cardiac toxicity, cases of congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure have been reported in patients without known predisposition. Decreased peripheral blood counts have been reported from postmarketing experience. Seizures have been reported in patients using AVONEX, including patients with no prior history of seizure. Autoimmune disorders of multiple target organs have been reported. Routine periodic blood chemistry, hematology, liver function, and thyroid function tests are recommended. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. AVONEX should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. The most common side effects associated with AVONEX treatment are flu-like symptoms, including chills, fever, myalgia, and asthenia.
For additional important safety information, and the full United States prescribing information, please see www.AVONEX.com.
About TYSABRI
TYSABRI is approved in more than 65 countries. TYSABRI is approved in the United States as a monotherapy for relapsing forms of MS, generally for patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, an alternative MS therapy due to the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). In the European Union, it is approved for highly active RRMS in adult patients who have failed to respond to beta interferon or have rapidly evolving, severe RRMS.
TYSABRI has advanced the treatment of MS patients with its established efficacy. Data from the Phase 3 AFFIRM trial, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed that after two years, TYSABRI treatment led to a 68 percent relative reduction (p<0.001) in the annualized relapse rate when compared with placebo and reduced the relative risk of disability progression by 42-54 percent (p<0.001).
TYSABRI increases the risk of PML, an opportunistic viral infection of the brain which usually leads to death or severe disability. Infection by the JC virus (JCV) is required for the development of PML and patients who are anti-JCV antibody positive have a higher risk of developing PML. Factors that increase the risk of PML are presence of anti-JCV antibodies, prior immunosuppressant use, and longer TYSABRI treatment duration. Patients who have all three risk factors have the highest risk of developing PML. Other serious adverse events that have occurred in TYSABRI-treated patients include hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) and infections, including opportunistic and other atypical infections. Clinically significant liver injury has also been reported in the post-marketing setting. A list of adverse events can be found in the full TYSABRI product labeling for each country where it is approved.
For additional important safety information, and the full TYSABRI prescribing information, please see www.TYSABRI.com.
About TECFIDERA
TECFIDERA delayed-release capsules are indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of MS. TECFIDERA has been proven to reduce MS relapses, progression of disability and MS brain lesions. The efficacy and safety of TECFIDERA has been studied in a large, global clinical program with more than 3,600 MS patients, which includes an ongoing long-term extension study. It is believed that TECFIDERA provides a new approach to treating MS by activating the Nrf2 pathway, although its exact mechanism of action is unknown. This pathway provides a way for cells in the body to defend themselves against inflammation and oxidative stress caused by conditions like MS.
The most common adverse reactions for TECFIDERA were flushing, mostly mild to moderate in nature, and GI events (i.e., diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain). These events are most common at the start of therapy and usually decrease over time.
TECFIDERA may decrease lymphocyte counts. Before starting treatment with TECFIDERA, a recent CBC (i.e., within six months) should be available. A CBC is recommended annually and as clinically indicated.
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. TECFIDERA should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
For additional important safety information, and the full TECFIDERA prescribing information, please see www.TECFIDERA.com.

1. Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments.
We exclude certain purchase accounting related items associated with the acquistion of businesses, assets and amounts in relation to the consolidation of variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. These adjustments include charges for in-process research and development, the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets and adjustments to the fair value of our contingent consideration obligations. The exclusion of these charges provides management and investors with a supplemental measure of performance which the Company believes better reflects the underlying economics of the business.
2. Stock option expense recorded in accordance with the accounting standard for share-based payments.
We believe that excluding the impact of expensing stock options better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our business.
3. Other items.
We evaluate other items on an individual basis, and consider both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. We also include an adjustment to reflect the related tax effect of all reconciling items within our reconciliation of our GAAP to Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc.

Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
Biogen Idec Inc. (Biogen Idec) is seeking to launch TECFIDERA in the European Union (EU) with patent and regulatory data protection.  On May 29, 2013, Biogen Idec was granted a European patent that extends until 2028 and covers the expected EU TECFIDERA label dose of 480 mg.  Biogen Idec believes TECFIDERA is also entitled to regulatory data protection in the EU and is working to make TECFIDERA'S regulatory data protection clearer to all parties prior to launch.   This is expected to delay the launch of TECFIDERA in the EU until the second half of 2013.
Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 are slides from an investor presentation that Biogen Idec plans to present at the Deutsche Bank 38th Annual dbAccess Health Care Conference on May 30, 2013.
