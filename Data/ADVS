Exhibit 99.1
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Kinexus Corporation
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2000 with Report of Independent Auditors
To the Shareholders of Kinexus Corporation
        We have audited the accompanying statement of financial position of Kinexus Corporation (the "Company") as of December 31, 2000, and the related statements of operations, changes in shareholders' deficit and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
        We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
        In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Kinexus Corporation at December 31, 2000, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Noncash investing and financing items
        During 2000, holders of convertible debt in the principal amount of $8,034,867 and $603,511 in accrued interest elected to exercise their conversion right and converted these amounts into series B preferred stock of the Company. A note payable with a principal balance of $600,000 was converted to equity upon assumption of the liability by the chairman of the Company.
1.    Description of Business
        Kinexus Corporation ("Kinexus" or the "Company") markets a service to financial institutions that is used to aggregate financial data for affluent and high net worth customers and is sold on a subscription basis through private banks and boutique asset managers. The aggregated data is delivered over the Internet. Kinexus earns revenues based on the number of subscribers referred by each financial institution.
        Kinexus was previously known as "The Witan Group, Inc." and changed its name effective November 28, 2000. At the beginning of the year, The Witan Group, Inc. was organized as a limited liability company and was called "The Witan Group, LLC." As more fully discussed in Note 10, the Company converted to a C-Corporation on June 30, 2000.
2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
General
        The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has sustained losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. The Company's ability to meet its obligations in the ordinary course of business is dependent on the successful execution of potential customer agreements (or in the absence of such agreements, significantly reducing costs and expenditures) and its ability to deliver services in accordance with existing customer agreements, as well as its ability to implement cost reduction programs. While there can be no assurance, management believes that it will successfully execute its business plan for the year 2001. The Company received $17,000,000 and $59,000,000 in private equity financings in 1999 and 2000, respectively.
        The Company has a limited operating history and its prospects are subject to risks, expenses and uncertainties frequently encountered in the new and rapidly evolving markets for Internet products and services.
Use of Estimates
        Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition
        Fees for services are recognized at the time services are rendered.
        Revenues are currently generated from aggregation services and services provided to family office clients of the Company.
        A component of the fees generated is setup fees. These are recognized over the life of the customer relationship, which is currently estimated to be three years.
        Revenues from aggregation services are recognized ratably over the term of the related agreements. Revenues from services not yet rendered are deferred and taken into income as earned,
and the deferred element is included in liabilities. The Company had deferred revenues of $8,933,333 as of December 31, 2000.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
        The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on the expected collectibility of all accounts receivables. The Company had an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable from related parties of $562,500 as of December 31, 2000.
Software Costs
        Kinexus accounts for the cost of software development in accordance with Statement of Position 98-1 ("SOP 98-l"), "Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use." All development costs incurred prior to the application development stage for a software product are expensed as incurred. Development costs incurred during the application development stage through the date of general release of the software are capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of the software product. The estimated life of this software is nine months.
        The Company has incurred and expensed $5,847,639 of research and development costs for such software for the year ended December 31, 2000. The application development stage of version 1 of the Company's software product occurred in the fourth quarter of 1999. Version 2 of the product reached the application development stage during the first quarter of 2000. The capitalized software cost will be amortized over 9 months. The software was placed in service November 1, 2000. $3,260,489 of software costs was capitalized under this standard during the year ended December 31, 2000. The related accumulated amortization and amortization expense at and for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $680,087.
Property and Equipment
        Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of depreciable assets. Useful lives for property and equipment are as follows:
        Improvements are capitalized, expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
Syndication Costs
        Syndication costs, including legal, travel and entertainment, consulting, and other related expenditures are offset against capital raised from existing shareholders or new shareholders. Similar costs related to active prospects are charged to Deferred Syndication Costs until such time as capital is contributed or the prospect is no longer active. All costs related to syndication for prospects that are no longer considered active are expensed as operating costs in the period that such determination is made.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
        Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and other investments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less.
Earnings (Loss) Per Share
        Basic earnings (loss) per share excludes any dilutive effects of options, warrants and convertible securities and is calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares and equivalent shares outstanding during the period. All of Kinexus' common stock equivalents are excluded from diluted loss per share since their effect is antidilutive.
Stock-Based Compensation
        The Company accounts for its employee stock option plans in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations. Compensation expense related to employee stock options is recorded only if, on the date of grant, the fair value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the stock option. The Company adopted the disclosure-only requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," which allows entities to continue to apply the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 for transactions with employees and non-employee board of director members and provide pro forma net income (loss) and pro forma earnings (loss) per share disclosures for employee stock as if the fair-value-based method of accounting in SFAS No. 123 had been applied to these transactions.
3.    Income Taxes
        Through June 30, 2000, the Company operated within a limited liability company that was treated as a partnership for income tax purposes. Under Federal, state and local income tax laws generally applicable to partnerships, the tax effects of the Company's activities during that period accrued directly to its members. Accordingly, no provision for, or benefit from, income taxes has been made for this period.
        Effective July 1, 2000, the Company was reorganized as a corporation. There is no provision for, or benefit from, income taxes during the period beginning July 1, 2000 and ending December 31, 2000 because the Company incurred losses for this period and all deferred tax assets arising on account of these losses have been fully offset with a valuation allowance.
        The difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 35% is primarily attributable to the establishment of such valuation allowance against all deferred tax assets.
        The Company is reasonably expecting to generate a net operating loss for the period during which it was a corporation. Such net operating loss will expire in 2020.
4.    Property, Equipment and Software
        Property, equipment and software consist of:
        Property and equipment depreciation expense including equipment under capital lease was $1,246,841 for the year ended December 31, 2000. Software amortization expense was $1,198,925 for the year ended December 31, 2000.
5.    Notes Payable
        Notes payable of the Company consist of the following:
        The following note is due on March 15, 2001. First Union Investors, Inc. is an investor in and a customer of the Company. The interest rate is 10%.
        The Company had a subordinated note payable to Perot Systems of $600,000. On September 20, 2000, an officer of Kinexus assumed the Company's liability to Perot Systems. This assumption of debt was accounted for as a contribution of capital.
6.    Commitments and Contingencies
Leases
        The Company leases certain office and storage space under non-cancelable lease agreements, which are reflected in the financial statements as operating leases. The following is a schedule of future minimum rental payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining terms in excess of one year at December 31, 2000.
        The Company's last capital lease expired on August 31, 2000. All obligations related to the capital leases have been fulfilled.
        Total rent expense for operating leases was $1,174,676 for the year ended December 31, 2000.
Other Commitments
        The Company is required under the terms of certain agreements with two shareholders to repurchase the shareholders' interests. The agreements to repurchase units vary between agreements and are required upon the attainment of certain funding levels or the passage of time. The commitment of the Company under these agreements is to repurchase 942,679 shares for $928,600 and 194,773 shares for $500,000.
Legal Proceedings
        There are presently no material claims filed against the Company, nor are there any material unasserted claims that the Company is aware of.
7.    Related Party Transactions
        Witan Management Company, as manager, received a management fee of $50,000 per month until June 1, 2000 when the management fee was reduced to $25,000. This management fee agreement was terminated on October 20, 2000. The Company expensed $362,903 related to this agreement in the year ended December 31, 2000. At the end of the year there was no outstanding balance owed to the Witan Management Company.
        MIC Real Estate, L.L.C., which is related by common ownership, receives a monthly license fee of $29,714 per month for real estate licensed by Kinexus. This arrangement began July 15, 2000. The Company expensed $164,865 in the year ended December 31, 2000.
        Kinexus contracted with LoBue Associates, Inc. ("LoBue") to provide development and other services to Kinexus. Kinexus and LoBue are related through common ownership. During the period, Kinexus paid to LoBue $398,457 and had outstanding obligations of $42,734 to LoBue at December 31, 2000.
        Kinexus obtained some of its air transportation through MIC Aircraft, L.L.C., a company affiliated through common ownership. Total expenses incurred under this arrangement amounted to $1,177,076 during the calendar year 2000, of which $64,395 is included in accounts payable to related parties at December 31, 2000. Effective at the close of the third round of financing, October 24, 2000 (See Note 10), MIC Aircraft, L.L.C. charged Kinexus the coach fare equivalent for each passenger.
        Kinexus funds benefits, payroll and other expenses for certain Morriss Holdings L.L.C. ("Morriss Holdings") controlled entities, which reimburse Kinexus for these payments. Morriss Holdings provides the same service for Kinexus. Morriss Holdings is related to the Company by common ownership. At December 31, 2000 Kinexus' total payable related to these items was $192,293.
        The CEO is indebted to the Company including interest, for $439,587 as of December 31, 2000. Interest will accrue at a rate of 5.5% per year. The loan matures on December 31, 2003, but may accelerate and become fully due upon the occurrence of certain events per the loan agreement.
        See Note 5 for related party information concerning notes payable.
8.    Segment Information
        The Company's chief operating decision-maker ("CODM") is considered to be the Company's CEO. The CODM evaluates performance, makes operating decisions and allocates resources based on financial data consistent with the presentation in the accompanying financial statements. Therefore, the Company operates in a single segment for purposes of disclosure under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131.
9.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements
        In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 ("SFAS 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This statement requires that companies recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure these instruments at fair value. In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging ActivitiesDeferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133." This statement deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 133 to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. In June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS 138 "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities" which made minor amendments to SFAS 133. The Company does not expect SFAS 133 to have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations.
10.  Shareholders' Deficit
Private Equity FinancingSecond Round
        On March 15, 2000, the Company raised $19,000,000 of equity investment in a second private equity financing (the "Second Round"). A previous agreement with an existing member required the Company to repurchase 167,212 of Class A member interests for $480,000 upon completion of the Second Round. To satisfy this obligation, one of the Second Round investors purchased these units in an outside transaction.
Disposition of Class B and C LLC Member Interests
        As described in the 1999 financial statements, on December 3, 1999 the Company had issued 10,250,000 class B units to its manager and 5,637,500 class C units to a group of employees. These units had no initial capital value but were entitled to share in the profits of the Company earned after December 3, 1999. In the Second Round, the number of units was increased to 11,402,171 class B units and 6,350,680 class C units.
        These units were accounted for as stock appreciation rights. Accordingly, Kinexus recognized compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 of $15,978,437, based on the growth in the value of the Company between December 31, 1999 and June 30, 2000. Upon the Company's conversion to a C-Corporation the units were converted to common stock and no further compensation expense was recorded with respect to these units.
Conversion to a C-Corporation
        In connection with the Second Round, Kinexus agreed to convert to a C-Corporation prior to the next financing round or September 30, 2000, whichever occurred first. On June 30, 2000 Kinexus converted to a C-Corporation.
Series A Preferred Stock
        Upon conversion of the Company from an LLC to a C-Corporation, existing Witan Group, LLC class A units were exchanged for an equal number of Series A Convertible Preferred shares ("Series A Preferred"). At December 31, 2000 the Company had 104,321,626 shares of Series A Preferred outstanding. All the holders of the Series A Preferred are entitled to receive dividends at the annual rate of 8% of the share price. Dividends are not cumulative and will not accrue unless declared by the Board of Directors of the Company. Dividends will be paid prior to and in preference to dividends on the common stock or any other preferred stock that is junior to the Series A Preferred.
        The Series A Preferred shares are convertible at the option of the holders into an equal number of shares of common stock ("Voluntary Conversion"). In addition, the Series A Preferred shall
automatically convert into an equal number of shares of common stock upon an initial public offering ("Automatic Conversion"). The conversion ratio of 1:1 for both voluntary and automatic conversions is subject to upward adjustment if the Company subsequently issues additional common shares, convertible securities or options for consideration less than $1.1138 per share. Furthermore, the $1.1138 trigger will be reduced proportionately whenever such an event results in an increase in the conversion ratio.
        The holders of Series A Preferred vote together with the holders of common stock on an as-if-converted basis. The holders of Series A Preferred also have voting rights related to certain amendments to the Company's articles of incorporation.
        In the event of liquidation of the Company, holders of Series A Preferred not previously converted to common stock shall rank equal with the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series B Preferred") and shall be entitled to receive $1.1138 per share, subject to adjustment as described in the Series A Preferred Certificate of Designation, plus an amount equal to all declared but unpaid dividends, in preference to the holders of common stock. If, upon occurrence of such an event, the assets distributed among holders of Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred are insufficient to cover the combined liquidation preferences then the assets available for distribution will be distributed pro-rata between the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred.
Private Equity FinancingThird Round
        On October 24, 2000 the Company executed a private equity financing (the "Third Round") that raised $48,638,378 consisting of:
1.
Issuance of 55,710,306 units of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock in exchange for $40,000,000 cash investment.
2.
Conversion of notes payable in the amount of $8,638,378 including accrued interest to 12,031,167 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.
        At December 31, 2000 the Company had 67,741,473 shares of Series B Preferred outstanding. Holders of the Series B Preferred are entitled to receive cumulative dividends in kind at the annual rate of 8% of the price per share, compounded on a semi-annual basis. Dividends will accrue regardless of whether declared and will be paid prior to and in preference to any dividend on any other class of stock of the Company, including the Series A Preferred.
        The Series B Preferred is convertible into common stock using a 1:1 conversion ratio. This conversion ratio is subject to upward adjustment if the Company does not complete an Initial Public Offering ("IPO") as follows:
1.
If the Company does not complete an IPO by December 31, 2001 the conversion ratio increases to 1:1.22463; and
2.
If the Company completes an IPO that is not a Qualified Public Offering by December 31, 2001, the conversion ratio increases to 1:1.10106. A Qualified Public Offering is a firm commitment underwriting, executed by a major bracketed underwriter with gross proceeds to the Company of at least $40,000,000 and a price per share of at least $2.154.
        In addition, the conversion ratio is subject to upward adjustment if the Company issues additional common shares, convertible securities or options for consideration less than $0.718 per share.
        The Series B Preferred shall automatically convert into common stock upon the written consent of holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred or the consummation of a Qualified Public Offering.
        The Series B Preferred, plus any accrued but unpaid dividends, shall be redeemable at the option of the holders after the fifth anniversary of the closing of the Third Round or after the occurrence of an event of non-compliance defined as the breach of any material representation or warrant, failure to comply with any covenant or agreement contained in the Third Round closing documents or the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company.
        The holders of Series B Preferred vote together with the holders of the Series A preferred and the holders of the common stock on an as-if-converted basis. The holders of Series B Preferred also have voting rights related to certain amendments to the Company's Articles of Incorporation.
        In the event of liquidation of the Company, holders of Series B Preferred not previously converted to common stock shall rank equal with Series A Preferred and shall be entitled to receive the amount of their purchase price per share, plus any accrued dividends, in preference to the holders of common stock. If, upon occurrence of such an event, the assets distributed among holders of Series B Preferred and Series A Preferred are insufficient to cover the combined liquidation preferences, the assets of the Company available for distribution will be distributed pro-rata between the Series B Preferred and Series A Preferred.
Redemption of Shares
        On November 6, 2000 pursuant to a repurchase agreement with an investor, the Company repurchased 141,085 shares of Series A Preferred for $405,000. (See similar commitments in Note 6.)
11.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
        The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If the assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The fair value of the assets is determined by quoted market prices if available, or the best information available in the circumstances. For the year ended December 31, 2000 $617,071 was recognized as a special charge, included on the Statement of Operations in the Office and other caption. The fair value of the assets recognized as impaired was due to lost, damaged or obsolete equipment.
12.  Employee Compensation Plans
        The Company has adopted a variety of compensation plans for certain of its employees as well as for certain non-employee advisors. These plans are designed to facilitate a pay-for-performance policy, provide compensation commensurate with other leading technology companies and provide for internal ownership in order to align the interests of employees with long-term interests of the Company's shareholders. These plans are summarized below.
Stock Options
        The Company awarded 6,360,000 employee stock warrants on December 31, 2000, with an exercise price of $0.40. These options vest ratably after one, two, three and four years of continued employment, commencing with date of hire, and expire ten years from the date granted.
        The Company follows the intrinsic value method in accounting for its stock options. Had compensation cost been recognized based on the fair value at the date of grant for options granted in
2000, the pro forma amounts of the Company's net loss and net loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2000 would have been as follows:
        The estimated fair value of the Company's options granted during 2000 was $0.066 on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the assumptions referred below.
Employee Awards
        The Company granted 8,801,121 shares of voting common stock to the CEO on December 29, 2000. These shares vest as follows: One-half on grant date, and the remainder over 17 months with accelerated vesting based on certain specified performance criteria. The fair value of these shares was estimated to be $0.08 per share. The Company recognized $469,393 of expense related to this award during 2000.
Non-employee Awards
        The Company awarded 1,375,000 of stock warrants to certain consultants on December 31, 2000, with an exercise price of $0.40. The Company incurred $90,750 of expense related to these stock options.
        The fair value of each warrant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following assumptions were used for 2000:
        The Company granted 848,500 shares of common stock at an issue price of $0.04 to outside advisors for services provided during the year ended December 31, 2000. The Company incurred $33,940 of expense related to this stock award.
13.  Computation of Net Loss Per Share
        Basic and diluted net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares actually outstanding during the period. There are potentially dilutive securities outstanding, as follows:
(A)
Warrants issued in connection with notes payable equal to 1% of current shares outstanding before effects of the conversion, to creditors with an exercise price of $1,290,000 expiring March 15, 2005. At December 31, 2000 the Company calculated that this would represent 2,167,334 warrants issued with an exercise price of $0.595201.
(B)
Warrants issued in connection with an interest free bridge loan from a related party.
(C)
These warrants become exercisable when the customer delivers a certain quantity of subscribers. A total of 2,326,633 warrants will be issued upon the implementation of 32,500 subscribers over a two year period beginning October 1, 2000. As of December 31, 2000 zero subscribers have been implemented under the terms of this agreement. 1,000,000 warrants will be issued upon the implementation of 50,000 subscribers. As of December 31, 2000 30,000 subscribers have been implemented under the terms of this agreement. Two additional tranches of 1,000,000 warrants will be issued upon the implementation of 100,000 and 150,000 subscribers. The exercise price of these tranches will be the fair market value at the issue date.
        The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) from continuing operations per common share:
14.  Vulnerability Due to Revenue Concentration
        The Company executed a service level agreement with a major money center bank. This customer accounts for substantially all of the revenue for the Company. The loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

Exhibit 99.2
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Kinexus Corporation
Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2001 with Report of Independent Auditors
To the Shareholders of Kinexus Corporation:
        We have audited the accompanying statement of financial position of Kinexus Corporation (the "Company") as of December 31, 2001 and the related statements of operations, changes in shareholders' deficit and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
        We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
        In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Kinexus Corporation at December 31, 2001, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1.    Description of Business
        Kinexus Corporation ("Kinexus" or the "Company") markets a service to financial institutions that is used to aggregate financial data for affluent and high net worth customers and is sold on a subscription basis through private banks and boutique asset managers. The aggregated data is delivered over the Internet, on paper reports, or through direct electronic feeds to the financial institutions. Kinexus earns revenues based on the number of subscribers referred by each financial institution.
2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
General
        As more fully described in Note 16, the Company signed a merger agreement with Advent Software, Inc. ("Advent") on December 31, 2001. The merger closed on February 14, 2002.
Use of Estimates
        Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition
        Fees for services are recognized at the time services are rendered.
        Revenues are currently generated from aggregation services, consulting services, and services provided to family office clients of the Company.
        A component of the fees generated is setup fees. These are recognized over the life of the customer relationship, which is currently estimated to be three years.
        Revenues from aggregation services are recognized ratably over the term of the related agreements. Revenues from services not yet rendered are deferred and reported as revenue when earned, and the deferred element is included in liabilities. The Company had deferred revenues of $5,088,557 as of December 31, 2001.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
        The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on the expected collectibility of all accounts receivables. The Company had an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable of $217,658 as of December 31, 2001.
Software Costs
        Kinexus accounts for the cost of software development in accordance with Statement of Position 98-1 ("SOP 98-l"), "Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use." All development costs incurred prior to the application development stage for a software product are expensed as incurred. Development costs incurred during the application development stage through the date of general release of the software are capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of the software product. The estimated life of this software is nine months.
        The Company has incurred and expensed $2,551,551 of research and development costs for such software for the year ended December 31, 2001. The application development stage of version 1 of the Company's software product occurred in the fourth quarter of 1999. Version 2 of the product reached the application development stage during the first quarter of 2000. The software was placed in service November 1, 2000. Version 3 of the Company's software reached application development stage in February 2001. The software was placed in service during September 2001. The capitalized software cost will be amortized over nine months. $8,626,355 of software costs was capitalized under SOP 98-1 as of December 31, 2001 and accumulated amortization of $8,396,824 was booked as of December 31, 2001. The related amortization expense was $7,716,737 for the year ended December 31, 2001.
Property and Equipment
        Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of depreciable assets. No salvage values are assumed. Estimated useful lives for property and equipment are as follows:
        Improvements are capitalized and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
Syndication Costs
        Syndication costs, including legal, travel and entertainment, consulting, and other related expenditures are offset against capital raised from existing shareholders or new shareholders. Similar costs related to active prospects are charged to Deferred Syndication Costs until such time as capital is contributed or the prospect is no longer active. All costs related to syndication for prospects that are no longer considered active are expensed as operating costs in the period that such determination is made.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
        Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and other investments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less.
Earnings (Loss) Per Share
        Basic earnings (loss) per share excludes any dilutive effects of options, warrants and convertible securities and is calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares and equivalent shares outstanding during the period. All of Kinexus's common stock equivalents are excluded from diluted loss per share since their effect is antidilutive.
Stock-Based Compensation
        The Company accounts for its employee stock option plans in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations. Compensation expense related to employee stock options is recorded only if, on the date of grant, the fair value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the stock
option. The Company adopted the disclosure-only requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," which allows entities to continue to apply the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 for transactions with employees and non-employee board of director members and provide pro forma net income (loss) and pro forma earnings (loss) per share disclosures for employee stock as if the fair-value-based method of accounting in SFAS No. 123 had been applied to these transactions.
Intangible Assets
        The excess of the cost over fair value of net assets of purchased businesses is recorded as intangible assets and is amortized on a straight-line basis over 24 months. The Company's intangible asset consists entirely of goodwill created upon its acquisition of GreenTrak, Inc. (see Note 13). The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of intangible assets to ensure they are appropriately valued. Intangible assets were $1,465,672 net, as of December 31, 2001. Accumulated amortization was $879,403 as of December 31, 2001. Kinexus will be implementing Statements of Financial Accounting Standards "Business Combinations" No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" beginning January 1, 2002.
3.    Income Taxes
        Effective July 1, 2000, the Company was reorganized as a corporation. There is no provision for, or benefit from, income taxes during the period beginning January 1, 2001 and ending December 31, 2001 because the Company incurred losses for this period and all deferred tax assets arising on account of these losses have been fully offset with a valuation allowance.
        The difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 35% is primarily attributable to the establishment of such valuation allowance against all deferred tax assets.
        The Company expects to generate a net operating loss for the period during which it was a corporation. Such net operating loss will expire in 2020.
4.    Property, Equipment and Software
        Property, equipment and software consist of:
        Property and equipment depreciation expense was $2,523,756 for 2001. Software amortization expense was $8,810,064 for 2001. Goodwill amortization expense of $879,403 for 2001 is included in the Depreciation and amortization caption of the statement of operations (See notes 2 and 15).
5.    Notes Payable
        Notes payable of Kinexus consist of the following:
        From October through December 2001, Gryphon Financing, L.L.C., a related party by common ownership, provided funds in the form of interest bearing advances. The following notes were issued to
evidence the indebtedness of Kinexus. These notes are due one year from issue date. The interest rate is 10%.
        Total interest accrued on these notes as of December 31, 2001 is $107,377.
        Total debt issue costs balance as of December 31, 2001 was $20,354. These costs are being amortized over the life of notes.
        On December 31, 2001 Advent Software, Inc. provided funds in the form of a non-interest bearing advance in the amount of $415,000. On February 14, 2002 Advent and Kinexus entered into a merger agreement (see Note 16).
6.    Commitments and Contingencies
Leases
        The Company leases certain office and storage space under non-cancelable lease agreements, which are reflected in the financial statements as capital and operating leases. The following is a schedule of future minimum rental payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining terms in excess of one year, together with the net present value of the net minimum lease payments under capital lease at December 31, 2001.
        Total rent expense for operating leases was $1,838,735 for the year ended December 31, 2001.
        The Company has made deposits for office space it leases under non-cancelable lease agreements, with utilities and for equipment it leases under capital and operating leases. Listed below are the leased properties, vendors and deposit amounts.
Other Commitments
        The Company is required under the terms of certain agreements with two shareholders to repurchase the shareholders' interests. The commitments to repurchase units vary between agreements. The commitment of the Company under these agreements is to repurchase 942,679 shares for $928,600 and 194,773 shares for $500,000.
Legal Proceedings
        There are presently no material claims filed against the Company, nor are there any material unasserted claims that the Company is aware of.
7.    Related Party Transactions
        MIC Real Estate, L.L.C., which is related by common ownership, received a monthly license fee of $29,714 per month for real estate licensed by Kinexus. This arrangement began July 15, 2000. The license fee was reduced to $11,955 beginning October 1, 2001 and is scheduled to end on December 31, 2001. The Company expensed $303,290 in the year ended December 31, 2001.
        Kinexus contracted with LoBue Associates, Inc. ("LoBue") to provide development and other services to Kinexus. Kinexus and LoBue are related through common ownership. During 2001, Kinexus paid to LoBue $276,428 and had estimated outstanding obligations of $43,500 to LoBue at December 31, 2001.
        Kinexus obtained some of its air transportation through MIC Aircraft, L.L.C., a company affiliated through common ownership. Total expenses incurred under this arrangement amounted to $108,578 during the calendar year 2001. At December 31, 2001, Kinexus's total payable to MIC Aircraft had been settled. Effective at the close of the third round of financing, October 24, 2000 (See Note 10), MIC Aircraft, L.L.C. charged Kinexus the coach fare equivalent for each trip taken by a Kinexus employee.
        During 2001, Kinexus funded benefits and other expenses for certain Morriss Holdings L.L.C. ("Morriss Holdings") controlled entities, which reimburse Kinexus for these payments. Morriss Holdings provided the same service for Kinexus. Effective November 1, 2001, Kinexus stopped funding benefits on behalf of Morriss Holdings. Morriss Holdings is related to the Company by common ownership. At December 31, 2001, Kinexus's total receivable related to these items was $20,880. Kinexus has made advances to several officers of the Company for business travel and other expenses. At December 31, 2001, Kinexus's total receivable related to this item was $23,985.
        The CEO is indebted to the Company, including interest, for $463,753 as of December 31, 2001. Interest accrues at a rate of 5.5% per year. The loan matures on December 31, 2003, but may accelerate and become fully due upon the occurrence of certain events per the loan agreement. Total interest earned on this loan was $24,365 during 2001. This loan was fully reserved on December 31,
2001. The loan is non-recourse and secured by common stock. Under the terms of merger agreement with Advent the common stock will have zero value (see Note 16).
        As more fully described in Footnote 5, Gryphon Financing, LLC has provided funds to Kinexus in the form of interest bearing advances in the amount of $6,114,688.
8.    Segment Information
        The Company's chief operating decision-maker ("CODM") is considered to be the Company's CEO. The CODM evaluates performance, makes operating decisions and allocates resources based on financial data consistent with the presentation in the accompanying financial statements. Therefore, the Company operates in a single segment for purposes of disclosure under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information".
9.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements
        Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 ("SFAS 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", which establishes the accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. This statement requires that companies recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure these instruments at fair value. The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 133 to the Company's results was immaterial. As of December 31, 2001 the Company has no derivative instruments and has not engaged in hedging activities.
        In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 ("SFAS 141"), "Business Combinations", and No. 142 ("SFAS 142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Under the new rules, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the SFAS 142. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives.
        The Company will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter 2002. Application of the non-amortization provisions of the Statement is expected to result in an increase in net income of $1,172,538 per year. During 2002, the Company will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of January 1, 2002 and has not yet determined what the effect of these tests will be on earnings and financial position of the Company.
10.  Shareholders' Deficit
Series A Preferred Stock
        At December 31, 2001 the Company had 104,321,626 shares of Series A Preferred outstanding. All the holders of the Series A Preferred are entitled to receive dividends at the annual rate of 8% of the share price. Dividends are not cumulative and will not accrue unless declared by the Board of Directors of the Company. Dividends will be paid prior to and in preference to dividends on the common stock or any other preferred stock that is junior to the Series A Preferred.
        The Series A Preferred shares are convertible at the option of the holders into an equal number of shares of common stock ("Voluntary Conversion"). In addition, the Series A Preferred shall automatically convert into an equal number of shares of common stock upon an initial public offering ("Automatic Conversion"). The initial conversion ratio of 1:1 for both voluntary and automatic conversions is subject to upward adjustment on a weighted average basis if the Company subsequently issues additional common shares, convertible securities or options for consideration per share less than
$1.1138. Furthermore, the $1.1138 conversion price will be reduced proportionately whenever such an event results in an increase in the conversion ratio.
        The Series A Preferred shall be redeemable at the option of the holders in the event that on or before October 24, 2005 neither an Initial Public Offering ("IPO") nor a sale or merger of the Company to a third party has occurred. The Series A Preferred will be redeemed for cash at a price equal to fair market value as determined by an independent financial appraiser. The Company will have six months from the date the redemption right is exercised to complete the redemption.
        The holders of Series A Preferred vote together with the holders of common stock on an as-if-converted basis. The holders of Series A Preferred also have separate voting rights related to certain material corporate events.
        In the event of liquidation of the Company, holders of Series A Preferred not previously converted to common stock shall rank equal with the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series B Preferred) and shall be entitled to receive $1.1138 per share, subject to adjustment as described in the Series A Preferred Certificate of Designation, plus an amount equal to all declared but unpaid dividends, in preference to the holders of common stock. If, upon occurrence of such an event, the assets distributed among holders of Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred are insufficient to cover the combined liquidation preferences then the assets available for distribution will be distributed pro-rata between the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred on an equal basis.
Series B Preferred Stock
        At December 31, 2001 the Company had 67,741,473 shares of Series B Preferred outstanding. Holders of the Series B Preferred are entitled to receive cumulative dividends in cash or in kind at the annual rate of 8% of the price per share, compounded on a semi-annual basis. Dividends will accrue regardless of whether declared and will be paid prior to and in preference to any dividend on any other class of stock of the Company, including the Series A Preferred.
        The Series B Preferred is initially convertible into common stock using a 1:1 conversion ratio. This conversion ratio is subject to upward adjustment if the Company does not complete an IPO as follows:
1.
If the Company does not complete an IPO by December 31, 2001 the conversion ratio increases to 1: 1.22463; and
2.
If the Company completes an IPO that is not a Qualified Public Offering by December 31, 2001, the conversion ratio increases to 1:1.10106. A Qualified Public Offering is an underwritten offering executed by a nationally recognized underwriter with gross proceeds to the Company of at least $40,000,000 and a price per share of at least $2.154.
        In addition, the conversion ratio is subject to upward adjustment on a full ratchet basis if the Company issues additional common shares, convertible securities or options for consideration less than $0.718 per share.
        The Series B Preferred shall automatically convert into common stock upon the written consent of holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred or the consummation of a Qualified Public Offering.
        The Series B Preferred, plus any accrued but unpaid dividends, shall be redeemable at the option of the holders after October 24, 2005 or after the occurrence of an event of noncompliance by the Company, which is defined as the material breach of any representation or warrant, failure to comply with any covenant or agreement contained in the Third Round closing documents or the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company. The Series B Preferred will be redeemed for cash at a price equal to the greater of (i) the fair value of such shares and (ii) the amount the holder would have received for such shares upon liquidation.
        The holders of Series B Preferred vote together with the holders of the Series A preferred and the holders of the common stock on an as-if-converted basis. The holders of Series B Preferred also have separate voting rights related to certain material corporate events.
        In the event of liquidation of the Company, holders of Series B Preferred not previously converted to common stock shall rank equal with Series A Preferred and shall be entitled to receive, in preference to the holders of common stock, the greater of (i) the purchase price per share plus any accrued dividends and (ii) the amounts such holder would have received if he converted such shares to common stock. If, upon occurrence of such an event, the assets distributed among holders of Series B Preferred and Series A Preferred are insufficient to cover the combined liquidation preferences, the assets of the Company available for distribution will be distributed pro-rata between the Series B Preferred and Series A Preferred on an equal basis.
        The merger agreement Kinexus signed with Advent (See note 16) will produce significantly different results from the above detailed information.
11.  Employee Compensation Plans
        The Company has adopted a variety of compensation plans for certain of its employees as well as for certain non-employee advisors. These plans are designed to facilitate a pay-for-performance policy, provide compensation commensurate with other leading technology companies and provide for internal ownership in order to align the interests of employees with long-term interests of the Company's shareholders. These plans are summarized below.
Stock Options
        The Company awarded 6,360,000 employee stock options on December 31, 2000, with an exercise price of $0.40. These options vest ratably after one, two, three and four years of continued employment, commencing with date of hire, and expire ten years from the date granted. The Company awarded 743,750 employee stock options during 2001, with an exercise price of $0.40 and an additional 4,564,750 employee stock options were awarded on April 16, 2001, with an exercise price of $0.75. These options vest ratably after one, two, three and four years of continued employment, commencing with date of hire, and expire ten years from the date granted. At December 31, 2001, there were 114,706 employee stock options available for future grants.
        The following summarizes stock options granted from December 31, 2000 through December 31, 2001:
        The Company follows the intrinsic value method in accounting for its stock options. Had compensation cost been recognized based on the fair value at the date of grant for options granted in
2000 and 2001 and vesting during 2001, the pro forma amounts of the Company's net loss and net loss per share during 2001 would have been as follows:
        The estimated fair value of the Company's options granted during 2000 and 2001 with a strike price of $0.40 was $0.066 on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the assumptions referred below.
        The estimated fair value of the Company's options granted during 2001 with a strike price of $0.75 was $0.062 on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the assumptions referred below.
Employee Awards
        The Company granted 8,801,121 shares of voting common stock to the CEO on December 29, 2000. These shares vest as follows: One-half on grant date, and the remainder over 17 months with accelerated vesting based on certain specified performance criteria. The fair value of these shares was estimated to be $0.08 per share. Compensation expense related to this award is recognized over the period that the award vests. The Company recognized expense related to this award of $165,668 during 2001. Pursuant to the merger agreement (see Note 16), the vesting of these shares will accelerate.
12.  Computation of Net Loss Per Share
        Basic and diluted net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares actually outstanding during the period. There are potentially dilutive securities outstanding, as follows:
(A)
Warrants issued in connection with notes payable to creditors with an exercise price of $645,000 expiring March 15, 2005. At December 31, 2001 this represents 1,083,667 warrants issued with an exercise price of $0.595201.
(B)
Warrants issued in connection with notes payable equal to .5% of current shares outstanding before effects of the conversion, to creditors with an exercise price of $645,000 expiring March 15, 2005. At December 31, 2001 the Company calculated that this would represent 1,231,502 warrants issued with an exercise price of $0.523751.
(C)
Warrants issued in connection with an interest free bridge loan from a related party. On September 12, 2000 the Company borrowed $3,000,000 under the terms of this bridge loan. This loan was repaid on October 25, 2000.
(D)
These warrants become exercisable when the customer delivers a certain quantity of subscribers. A total of 2,644,034 warrants will be issued upon the implementation of 32,500 subscribers over a two-year period beginning October 1, 2000. As of December 31, 2001 60 subscribers have been implemented under the terms of this agreement.
(E)
1,000,000 warrants will be issued upon the implementation of 50,000 subscribers. As of December 31, 2001 30,000 subscribers have been implemented under the terms of this agreement.
(F)
Two additional tranches of 1,000,000 warrants will be issued upon the implementation of 100,000 and 150,000 subscribers. The exercise price of these tranches will be the fair market value at the issue date.
(G)
Series B convertible preferred shares includes dividends as if converted into Series B. As of December 31, 2001 accrued dividends equal $4,762,307 and if converted would equal 6,632,740 Series B shares.
        The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) from continuing operations per common share:
13.  Acquisitions
        On April 1, 2001, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of GreenTrak, Inc. ("GreenTrak"). Under the terms of the agreement, each outstanding share of GreenTrak was exchanged for 1.1649166 Kinexus common stock. 16,800,000 shares of Kinexus stock were issued to the GreenTrak shareholders. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on fair market value. An intangible asset has been recognized for the amount of the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of the net assets acquired and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 24 months. Total goodwill recognized from the acquisition of GreenTrak was $2,345,076. The entire excess of the purchase price over net assets is being assigned to goodwill. No other separately identifiable intangible assets exist. A summary of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition follows:
        Estimated fair values:
        The results of operations of GreenTrak have been included in the Company's financial statements from the date of acquisition. On a pro forma basis, if GreenTrak had been acquired at the beginning of 2001 revenue, net income and earnings per share would not differ materially from the amounts reported in the accompanying statement of operations for year ended December 31, 2001.
14.  Vulnerability Due to Revenue Concentration
        The Company executed a service level agreement with a major money center bank. This customer accounted for most of the revenue for the Company in 2001. This agreement terminated in the last quarter of 2001. The Company is in the process of negotiating a new agreement.
15.  Restructuring Charge
        In connection with several strategic restructuring initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2001, Kinexus incurred a charge of $5,559,157 for the disposition of premises and equipment ($4,684,737) and employee and shareholder loans ($874,420).
16.  Subsequent Events (Unaudited)
Merger
        Effective February 14, 2002 the sale of Kinexus to Advent closed. Total consideration is approximately $39.003 million in cash and $8.5 million in warrants on Advent common stock. The holders of Series A preferred shares will received $14.627 million, the holders of Series B preferred will receive $24,376 million plus $8.5 million in warrants on Advent common stock and the holders of common shares will receive no consideration at the time of sale. In addition to the initial purchase consideration, shareholders of Kinexus are eligible to receive potential additional earn-out consideration of up to $115 million in cash and stock under a formula based on the amount of revenue and expenses.

        The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared to give effect to the acquisition by Advent Software, Inc. (Advent) of Kinexus Corporation ("Kinexus") on February 14, 2002. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is based on the following:
        1.    Our audited historical consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2001 and for the year then ended;
        2.    Kinexus's audited historical financial statements as of December 31, 2001 and for the year then ended;
        3.    Unaudited pro forma adjustments as described in the accompanying notes.
        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet at December 31, 2001 gives effect to the acquisition of Kinexus as if it occurred as of December 31, 2001. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year December 31, 2001 gives effect to the acquisition of Kinexus as if it occurred as of January 1, 2001.
        The related adjustments are described in the accompanying notes. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is based upon available information and certain assumptions set forth in the notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, which have been made solely for purposes of developing such unaudited pro forma financial information. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not purport to represent what our results of operations or financial condition would have been had the acquisition of Kinexus occurred as of the pro forma dates specified above, or to project our results of operations or financial condition for any future period or date.
        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001, Kinexus's historical financial statements and notes, the latter of which are included herein.
NOTE 1BASIS OF PRESENTATION
        On February 14, 2002, Advent acquired the Kinexus Corporation ("Kinexus"), which provides internal account aggregation, and manual data management services which will be used in our Advent TrustedNetwork service. The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired on the basis of their respective fair values on the acquisition date. We acquired Kinexus at amounts exceeding the tangible and identifiable intangible fair values of assets and liabilities resulting in goodwill of $29.5 million in order to further increase our deployment of Advent TrustedNetwork.
        The total purchase price of approximately $45.5 million consisted of cash upon closing of $34.0 million, a warrant to purchase 165,176 shares of our common stock valued at $8.5 million and acquisition costs of $3 million. The warrant has an exercise price of $0.01 per share, is immediately exercisable, and expires on January 1, 2003. The fair value of the warrant was calculated using the Black-Scholes method using the following assumptions: fair value of common stock of $51.34 per share, interest rate of 3%, volatility of 65.9% and a dividend rate of zero. There is $3.8 million of additional contingent consideration that is held in escrow for 14 months, which if released will be recorded as additional goodwill. There is also a potential additional earn-out distribution to shareholders of up to $115 million over the next two years in cash and stock under a formula based on revenue and expenses, which if earned will be recorded as additional goodwill. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities at February 14, 2002 is summarized below:
        Liabilities assumed of $43.7 million include cash advances from Advent of $4.9 million and estimated change-in-control separation obligations of $11.1 million. The purchase price is subject to further refinement and change over the next year due primarily to assessing the liabilities assumed. The amount allocated to intangibles was determined based on management's estimates using established valuation techniques.

San Francisco, CA, April 3, 2003
-
Advent Software, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADVS) today announced that it expects total revenue of approximately $33 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2003.  Total first quarter revenue is expected to comprise approximately 25 percent license and development fees, 66 percent maintenance and other recurring and 9 percent professional services. The company anticipates that first quarter expenses will be significantly below prior estimates for total cost of revenues, sales and marketing, product development and general and administrative.

"Nevertheless, we do see positive indications that our strategy is on target.  For example, we added a record number of Geneva clients during the quarter, and new bookings for recurring revenue were stronger than anticipated" concluded Caswell.
 
Advent will hold a brief conference call at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, April 3, 2003, to discuss its first quarter estimates. The dial-in number is (973) 582-2700. If you are unable to listen to the call at this time, a replay will be available by calling (973) 341-3080, passcode

ADVENT SOFTWARE REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
 
San Francisco, CA, April 15, 2003 -
Advent Software, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADVS) today announced that revenue for the first quarter ended March 31, 2003 was $33 million, compared with $49.2 million in the same quarter of last year.  Net loss for the quarter was $7.5 million or $0.23 cents per share under GAAP, which includes amortization charges for intangibles and restructuring charges.
 
"Our first quarter revenues reflect the current challenging market conditions, and are consistent with our April 3 announcement," said Peter Caswell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Advent Software. "During the quarter we significantly reduced our overall expenses, and we ended the quarter with $163.4 million in cash."
rd
 
"We proudly celebrate our 20 anniversary as an independent software provider to the financial services industry.  Advent's market leadership is evidenced by our large installed base of customers, our unparalleled track record in innovation and our strong balance sheet.  In 2003 we will continue to invest in product development to further expand Advent's solutions to enhance our clients' businesses," continued Caswell.

GENEVA HAS RECORD QUARTER; INTRODUCED TO GLOBAL ASSET MANAGERS
 
Geneva had a strong quarter, with a record number of new firms, particularly mid-sized hedge funds, choosing to adopt this unique solution.  Through its innovative technical architecture, Geneva delivers sophisticated tools to back offices, allowing more reliable accounting data on a more timely basis at a much lower cost than traditional systems.  Geneva also significantly enhances firms' straight-through processing (STP) performance by delivering investment accounting data that is accurate from the outset.
 
Among the firms that chose Geneva this quarter was AQR Capital Management LLC. 
"Geneva's integrated general ledger, the breadth of its product coverage and its open and scalable technology platform are what we feel differentiates the product from its competitors," said Aaron Goldberg, Chief Financial Officer of AQR Capital Management, LLC.  "I've used Advent products at other companies I've worked at, and feel very confident in the company's ability to support AQR's business."
The first quarter also marked the launch of Geneva into the global asset management market. These large asset management firms are under pressure to adapt to changing investment strategies while closely managing operating costs, and they spend a large portion of their back office expense in the portfolio accounting function.  Geneva specifically addresses these firms' needs to realize significant gains in productivity and efficiency.
 
 "We're very pleased with the progress we made with Geneva in the first quarter, not only in sales, but in the growth of the pipeline," said Caswell.  "Geneva is becoming the market-leading solution because it helps firms achieve significant operational efficiencies, particularly valuable in today's tough environment."
 
LAUNCHES SOLUTION FOR INDEPENDENT BROKER DEALERS
 
In January, Advent launched Advent/Techfi for Broker-Dealers,' an integrated set of solutions to help firms attract and retain independent advisor representatives and provide those representatives with a choice of leading technology tools to run their businesses.  This set of solutions addresses current key trends, which include an influx of investors seeking professional advice, and advisors competing amidst a crowded financial services market to win the "trusted advisor" relationship with their investor client.
 
Advent/Techfi for Broker-Dealers,' is based on the combined resources of Advent and Techfi Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Advent.  It offers consolidated reporting, performance reporting, portfolio management, compliance, integration with leading third-party applications, and a comprehensive sales and marketing program to assist independent broker-dealers in creating adoption among their representatives.
 
Atlas Brokerage Company L.P. is among the firms to have selected Advent/Techfi for Broker-Dealers in the first quarter. 
Tim Gerwing, Chief Technology Officer of
Atlas Brokerage said, "This solution will provide a superior and often-requested technology tool to our advisors while enhancing our back office compliance provisions.  We also now have a service that will help us recruit advisors in the future."
 
"The solution we launched in the first quarter shows the significant progress we've made in integrating Techfi and Advent over the past several months," said Caswell.
 
FIRST QUARTER RESTRUCTURING CHARGE
 
As previously announced, Advent recorded a $3.5 million restructuring charge during the first quarter. This charge is primarily related to reducing excess office facilities and eliminating duplicative functions that resulted from the integration of recent acquisitions.  The restructuring charge includes $2.5 million relating to the consolidation of office space in the New York City area and Melbourne, Australia and $1 million for severance payments to former Advent employees in both locations.

"When I returned in May, I made it clear that as a management team we are intent on controlling expenses tightly," said Stephanie DiMarco, Chairman and interim CEO of Advent.  "We still have some substantial challenges ahead of us as well as tough market conditions.  However, I am convinced that if we focus on our core markets, listen to our customers' needs and have a disciplined approach to execution, we will find opportunities that will allow us to have sustainable growth into the future."
 
ADVENT LAUNCHES HEDGE FUND AND FUND ADMINISTRATOR SOLUTIONS
 
In May Advent launched "Advent for Hedge Fund Managers," a comprehensive front-to-back solution that provides hedge fund managers with the reliable decision support for today's investing environment.  Available in two versions, Standard and Premier, the solution is designed to meet the diverse functional and technical requirements of hedge funds and funds of funds of all sizes and strategies.

The Premier module leverages the revolutionary Geneva portfolio accounting engine to provide comprehensive securities coverage, including swaps and distressed debt. It also includes multidimensional P&L reporting by fund, strategy, trader, analyst and custodian, and it provides unprecedented data accuracy, access and scalability.
 
Also in the second quarter, Advent launched "Advent for Fund Administrators,"
a next-generation solution designed to meet the specialized needs of firms that provide fund administration services to mutual funds, hedge funds and funds of funds. Geneva, the solution's core, has been enhanced with new fund structure functionality that allows firms to cut Net Asset Values at the class, sub-class or series level, simplifying the processes and accounting typically associated with complex master-feeder and fund of funds structures.
 
that meet the unique needs of the niche markets in financial services. Later in the third quarter Advent will launch "Advent for Asset Managers," featuring straight-through processing capabilities and added compliance functionality.
Advent will continue to introduce market-specific solutions
 
GENEVA CAPTURES NEW CLIENTS
 
Geneva continues to be sold on a stand-alone basis, and  is marketed to global asset managers, prime brokers, hedge funds and fund administrators.  In the second quarter, Geneva was chosen by a hedge fund managing $3 billion and by the alternative asset group of a major national bank.  Advent currently has many of the largest hedge funds using Geneva, but its functionality is also applicable to small and medium-sized hedge funds that use sophisticated trading strategies.
 
RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN REVENUES AND EXPENSES
 
Certain license and development fee and maintenance and other recurring revenue reported in prior comparative periods and in the first quarter of 2003 have been reclassified to professional services and other, to better reflect Advent's  view of the current business.  Additionally, the Company has reclassified certain amounts appearing in cost of revenues and operating expenses.  These reclassifications do not affect net revenues, net income or loss or stockholders' equity as previously reported.
 
GUIDANCE
 
Advent projects third quarter total revenues to be approximately flat with the second quarter and total expenses, excluding amortization of intangibles, to be approximately $37.5 million.  Management will not provide guidance on fall fiscal year 2003 due to continued uncertainty in Advent's market.

Geneva continues to build momentum and gain recognition as a premier technology platform for global firms. Geneva serves the needs of the prime broker, hedge fund, fund administrator, global asset manager and mutual fund markets, and in the third quarter Advent signed Geneva agreements with firms in three of these five markets.
 
One of these firms is D.E. Shaw & Co., L.P., a specialized investment and technology development firm with more than $5 billion in aggregate capital which will use Geneva for its portfolio accounting, general ledger, and management reporting functionality.
 
And Rothstein Kass & Company, P.C.'s affiliated fund administration firm, RK Consulting, LLC, licensed Geneva to provide portfolio accounting services and facilitate domestic tax accounting requirements for its clients. Through its relationship with RK Consulting, LLC, Advent is expanding its tax compliance capabilities to include wash sale tax treatment functionality in Geneva.
 
"With close to 30 customers now successfully using Geneva around the world, the solution is widely perceived as a highly reliable, high quality and low risk solution for institutional customers. And Geneva's depth of alternative investment functionality makes it a particularly attractive solution to large financial institutions who are increasingly focusing on this space," said DiMarco.

During the quarter, Advent's products and services were selected by Fifth Third Bank's Investment Division, a unit that oversees the management of more than $32 billion for private, institutional, and mutual fund clients. The bank recently merged several of its disparate asset management businesses to create a single entity, which required a technology platform delivering front-end investment management tools for its fund managers and traders.
 
Hibernia National Bank, a New Orleans-based bank with approximately $3.9 billion in assets, managing fixed income, equities, mutual funds and separately managed accounts, also selected Advent in the third quarter.
 
"What really impressed us was Advent's first-class services organization. The experience, knowledge and methodology of the Advent Services team left us with confidence and the peace of mind that this project will be a success," said Richard Chauvin, Hibernia's Chief Investment Officer.

On January 6, 2004, Advent Software, Inc. issued a press release announcing its anticipated fourth quarter results for the three months ended December 31, 2003. The press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 
Date: January 6, 2004
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
Advent Software, Inc. (Nasdaq: ADVS) today announced that it expects to generate total revenues of approximately $36.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2003, above previous guidance. Total fourth quarter revenue is expected to comprise approximately $9.0 million of license revenue, approximately $22.0 million of maintenance and other recurring revenue, and approximately $5.5 million of professional services and other revenue.
San Francisco, CA, Tuesday, January 6, 2004
 
"We're pleased by our improving revenue and expense trends over the past two quarters," said Advent's Chief Executive Officer, Stephanie DiMarco. "It was satisfying to end the year on a strong note," she continued.
 
Advent anticipates that total expenses will be approximately $43.5 million. This estimate includes a non-recurring $1.8 million write-off of internally developed software that is no longer used by the company, which will be recorded in cost of revenues, $3.4 million for amortization of intangibles, $2.0 million of restructuring charges relating to a workforce reduction and the closure of two offices during the quarter, and $0.4 million impairment of long-lived assets.
 
In addition, the company expects to record a non-cash charge of between $60 million and $75 million to recognize a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." As of September 30, 2003, the company had recorded net deferred tax assets of $68.5 million.
 
"Although our fourth quarter results are encouraging, we believe that GAAP profitability is still a few quarters away and, as a result, it's appropriate that we record a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets," said Graham Smith, Chief Financial Officer of Advent. "These deferred tax assets, comprised principally of net operating loss carry forwards, remain available for us to offset against future taxable income."
 
These preliminary results are based on management's initial analysis of operating results. Advent will announce its final results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2003 after market close on January 29, 2004.

Advent Software, Inc. (Nasdaq: ADVS) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2003.
San Francisco, CA, Thursday, January 29, 2004
 
Total revenue for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2003 was $36.9 million, compared with $36.3 million in the same quarter last year, and $34.5 million in the third quarter of 2003. Net loss for the quarter was $75.8 million or $2.31 per share, compared with a net loss of $6.1 million or $0.19 per share in the same quarter of last year, and a net loss of $5.4 million or $0.17 per share in the third quarter of 2003.

The company ended 2003 with $160 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, an increase of $8 million over September 30, 2003.
 
"Our improved revenue and lowered expenses as we exit the year are a result of disciplined execution of our plans to focus on our core markets and scale the business to appropriate expense levels," said Stephanie DiMarco, Chief Executive Officer of Advent. "The world's leading financial professionals rely on Advent's trusted solutions today, as they have over the last 20 years, to manage trillions of dollars. We enter 2004 having established a strong foundation upon which to enhance our market leadership and to build the next phase of this great company."

Geneva, Advent's premier platform for global firms in the prime broker, hedge fund, fund administrator, global asset management and mutual fund markets, continued to build momentum in the fourth quarter with the addition of three new firms that licensed the platform.
 
Among the new clients in the fourth quarter were a large U.S. hedge fund, a U.S fund administrator, and the European branch of another U.S. fund administrator. For the full year, Advent sold the Geneva platform to 13 new clients.
 
"I'm encouraged by the level of activity we saw in our Geneva business in the fourth quarter and throughout last year. Geneva is a sophisticated technology platform for global firms that have a high degree of business complexity. Geneva helps our clients manage their sophisticated businesses, and produces a superior return on their investment," said DiMarco.

Advent added 120 new Advent Office customers during the fourth quarter, and also saw a large volume of sales to its existing clients who purchased software and services to meet the changing needs of their businesses. These firms include Gofen and Glossberg, Freedom Capital Management and Trainer Wortham.
 
Gofen and Glossberg, an investment advisory firm and an Advent client for 16 years, purchased Advent's trade order management, automated reconciliation and contact management solutions to increase focus on compliance and create a true straight-through processing environment. The firm will use these Advent solutions to create a fully automated front-to-back office environment and reduce the likelihood of errors from a more manual trade process.
 
Freedom Capital Management, a Boston-based asset management firm and a client of Advent for 11 years, purchased Advent's Open Financial Information Exchange (FIX) functionality to supplement its trade order management system and increase the efficiency and accuracy of its order management process.
 
Trainer Wortham, an investment advisory firm and an Advent client for 11 years, purchased additional capacity for its existing installation, including a series of reports to automate and streamline its manual management fee billing process. "We'd created a very specialized billing structure over the years where almost everyone was an exception. Advent's software is going to greatly reduce the time it takes to process our bills, and ensure accuracy at the same time," said Rosemarie Astarita, Operations Manager at Trainer Wortham.

Ahli United Bank B.C.S. in Dubai, which caters to retail and high net worth individual clients, also purchased Advent solutions in the fourth quarter, to provide faster, higher quality support and reporting.
 
In addition to the new business, several existing clients in Europe signed on for additional products to enhance their implementation, including the wealth management unit of one of the largest global investment banks, which expanded its use of Advent solutions in its London office to incorporate more users after a successful initial implementation in the third quarter of 2003.

Total revenue for the first quarter of 2004 was $36.8 million, compared with $36.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, and $33.0 million in the same quarter last year.

EPURCHASE
CCOUNTING
 
Advent has reviewed its stock repurchases in 2001, 2002 and Q1 of 2003 and determined that its allocation of the entire purchase price, in excess of par value, for these repurchases as a reduction to additional paid-in capital was not the correct accounting treatment. Advent will adjust this allocation, resulting in additional paid-in capital increasing by a cumulative amount of approximately $41 million and retained earnings decreasing by the same amount as of December 31, 2003. The company's income statement, cash, total stockholders' equity and shares of common stock outstanding will be unaffected by these adjustments for all periods. Advent will file an amended 10-K for fiscal 2003 to restate the additional paid-in capital and retained earnings balances as of December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003.

Item 2.06 Material Impairments
 
On December 30, 2004, Advent concluded that a non-cash impairment charge of $0.7 million was required to reduce the carrying value of Advent Wealth Services-related intangible assets. The non-cash impairment charge is a result of significant underperformance by Advent Wealth Services relative to historical and projected future operating results which were apparent from our review of the fourth quarter and fiscal 2004 operating results and performance, as well as our decision to re-focus our strategic direction on our well-established core business.

Item 4.02(a) Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Report
 
In connection with its review of the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, management of Advent Software, Inc. (the "Company") determined that the previously issued financial statements contained in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004 should be amended to correct errors in those financial statements.
 
On March 2, 2005, management presented its findings and recommendation to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which approved the recommendation of management to restate the financial statements for the quarters ended June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004. The decision to restate these financial statements was made after management's discovery and analysis of additional impairment charges related to vacating a facility in San Francisco, California that should have been recognized in the second quarter ended June 30, 2004. The Company will record corrections to recognize additional non-cash impairment charges of approximately $900,000 and to reduce impaired property and equipment assets by the same amount. These corrections had no impact on the Company's financial statements in periods prior to the quarter ended June 30, 2004.
 
Management is currently evaluating whether these errors were the results of a control deficiency and, if so, whether the deficiency may be deemed to be a significant deficiency or a material weakness. As a result of these corrections, management has recommended and the Audit Committee has approved the restatement of its previously issued financial statements through the filing of an amended Form 10-Q for each of the quarters ended June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004. In addition, the Company will also incorporate these corrections, as well as the corrections noted in Item 8.01 below, to its results of operations for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 which results were furnished on a Form 8-K on February 1, 2005. These corrections will be reflected in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 (the "2004 Form 10-K") which the Company expects to file on or before March 16, 2005. The Company is working diligently to complete its review of these matters and to quantify the full impact of the necessary adjustments on each of the affected prior periods. However, due to the time and effort involved in determining the effect of these adjustments, in the event that the Company is unable to complete its analysis and file its 2004 Form 10-K by March 16, 2005, the Company will file a Form 12b-25 to delay the filing of its 2004 Form 10-K.
 
Item 8.01 Other Events
 
On March 2, 2005, management of the Company discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors the views expressed by the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission by letter to the accounting industry dated February 7, 2005 regarding certain operating lease accounting issues and their application under generally accepted accounting principles. Management and the Audit Committee discussed the issues regarding the Company's method of accounting for tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays, and the Audit Committee concurred with management's assessment that the Company's accounting for these items was incorrect. As a result, the Company has recorded corrections to its previously reported results of operations for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 which results were furnished on a Form 8-K on February 1, 2005. These corrections will increase rent expense by approximately $354,000 for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2004 and increase property and equipment assets and deferred rent on the balance sheet by approximately $1.2 million and $1.5 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2004. These corrections will be reflected in the Company's 2004 Form 10-K which the Company expects to file on or before March 16, 2005. In the event that the Company is unable to file its 2004 Form 10-K by March 16, 2005, the Company will file a Form 12b-25 to delay the filing of its 2004 Form 10-K. The impact of the error in accounting for certain leases was not material to the consolidated financial statements for any previously reported annual or interim periods nor was the correction of the error material to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Item 4.02 Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Report
 
In connection with its review of the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, management of Advent Software, Inc. (the "Company") has determined that the previously issued financial statements contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2003 and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004 should not be relied on because of errors in those financial statements.
 
In a Form 8-K filed on March 8, 2005 the Company previously disclosed that the financial statements in the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004 will be amended by the Company to record adjustments to recognize additional non-cash impairment charges of approximately $863,000 and to reduce impaired property and equipment assets by the same amount for the quarters ended June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004.
 
On March 25 and March 30, 2005, management presented additional findings and its recommendation to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which approved such recommendation of management to restate the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2003 and the quarters ended March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004. The decision to restate these financial statements was discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and was made after management's discovery of the following errors:
 
 
 
As a result, the Company will record corrections to the year ended December 31, 2003 to reduce income taxes payable by $4.6 million and to reduce the income tax provision by $4.6 million. These corrections had no impact on the Company's financial statements in periods prior to the quarter ended December 31, 2003.
 
Management has determined that these errors were the result of a control deficiency with respect to the Company's procedures over its deferred and state income tax accounts and believes that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness as of December 31, 2004. As disclosed in Form 8-K dated March 8, 2005, management had previously determined that a material weakness existed as of December 31, 2004 with respect to maintaining effective controls to completely identify and record non-cash impairment charges on abandoned property and equipment related to a restructuring of a building operating lease. While management's assessment of the Company's internal control over financial reporting is ongoing, because of the material weaknesses identified, management will conclude that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004.
 
A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The Company's evaluation of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 is not complete and management may identify additional control deficiencies. As previously reported, the Company expects that the material weaknesses identified will result in an adverse opinion by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004.
 
As a result of these corrections, management has recommended, and the Audit Committee has approved, the restatement of its previously issued financial statements. The Company will incorporate the restatement of its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2003 in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 (the "2004 Form 10-K").
The Company will restate each of the quarters ended March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004 through the filing of an amended Form 10-Q for each of these quarters. In addition, the Company will also incorporate these corrections for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 in the 2004 Form 10-K which it intends to file within the next several days.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

On April 7, 2005, Advent Software, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing that the Company received a notice on April 6, 2005 from the staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market which stated that because the Company had not yet filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2004, as required by Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14), effective with the open of business on Thursday April 7, 2005, the Company's trading symbol would be changed from "ADVS" to "ADVSE". The notice further indicated that Nasdaq would consider the Company's late filing in rendering a determination regarding the Company's continued listing on The Nasdaq National Market. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.01 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Advent filed its 2004 Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 8, 2005. On April 11, 2005, Advent was notified by The Nasdaq Stock Market that based upon the filing of its 2004 Form 10-K, it was now in compliance with Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) and accordingly the matter was closed. Advent will recommence trading under the symbol "ADVS" at the opening of business on April 13, 2005.

Exhibit 99.01
 
 
Advent Software, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADVS) announced today that the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Department (the "Nasdaq Staff") has notified the Company that it is not in compliance with the requirements of Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) because it has not yet filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2004 (the "2004 10-K") with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Consequently, Advent common stock is subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Stock Market. The Company's delay in filing its 2004 10-K is the only listing deficiency cited by the Nasdaq Staff.
San Francisco, CA, Thursday, April 7, 2005
-
 
Advent intends to request an appeal hearing before a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel (the "Panel") to review the delisting determination. Under the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules, the delisting of Advent's common stock will be stayed pending the Panel's review and determination. Until the Panel's ultimate determination, the date of which is not yet known, Advent common shares will continue to be traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market, but its trading symbol as of Thursday, April 7, 2005, will be amended from "ADVS" to "ADVSE", to reflect the Company's filing delinquency. Advent disclosed in a Form 8-K filed on March 31, 2005 that the Company's management was still in the process of completing its assessment of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, although because of the material weaknesses identified to date, management will conclude that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. The Company intends to file its 2004 10-K on or before Wednesday, April 13, 2005.

Dear Mr. Smith:
 
On April 5, 2005, Staff notified the Company that it no longer met the periodic filing requirement for The Nasdaq Stock Market under Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14).

As a result of the Company's compliance with the aforementioned Rule, the fifth character "E" will be removed from its trading symbol. Accordingly, the trading symbol for the Company's securities will be changed from ADVSE to ADVS at the opening of business on April 13, 2005.

Net income for the first quarter of 2005 was $785,000 or $0.02 per share, compared with a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2004 of $716,000 or $0.02 per share. The same quarter last year recorded a net loss of $1.1 million, or $0.03 per share.
 
Revenue and cost of revenue amounts for the comparable 2004 periods have been changed to reflect the change in accounting treatment for soft dollar brokerage fees for third party products from gross to net reporting.
 
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $131.1 million as of March 31, 2005. This compares to $165.5 million at December 31, 2004. During the first quarter, Advent repurchased 2,124,000 shares of its common stock at a cost of $38.0 million. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $5.4 million.

ERSPECTIVE
 
"In the first quarter, we achieved strong results across key areas: revenue growth, achieving positive earnings per share, the transition to term licensing, expanding our presence in the high end of the market, and continued progress in product development. We are well positioned for growth as we continue to provide leading software and services to investment management firms worldwide," said Stephanie DiMarco, Chief Executive Officer of Advent.

Item 4.02 (a) Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Report
 
In connection with its preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, management of Advent Software, Inc. (the "Company") has determined that the financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 and for the first three quarters of fiscal 2003 and 2004 cannot be relied on. Specifically, its disclosure for stock-based employee compensation expense under SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148, included in Note 1 to its previously issued financial statements contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 ("2004 10-K") and in the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for each of the quarterly periods referred to above, should not be relied upon because of errors in its disclosure of the pro forma effects on operating results as if the Company had elected to use the fair value approach to account for all stock-based compensation plans. This error had no impact on the Company's consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, cash flows, comprehensive income or stockholders' equity for any period.
 
On May 6, 2005, management presented its findings and recommendation to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which approved the recommendation to restate the stock-based employee compensation expense disclosures for fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004 included in Note 1 to its previously issued financial statements contained in its 2004 10-K together with the associated disclosure for the first three quarters of fiscal 2003 and 2004. The decision to restate the disclosure was discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and was made after discovery of errors relating to its disclosure, including the calculation of the effect of a stock option exchange program that took place on December 4, 2002, and the overall determination of the tax treatment of the pro forma option expense.
 
Management has determined that these errors were the result of a control deficiency with respect to the Company's procedures in correctly calculating and reporting its stock-based employee compensation expense under SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148, and believes that this control deficiency constituted a material weakness as of December 31, 2004 and as of March 31, 2005. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. As a result of these corrections, management has recommended, and the Audit Committee has approved, the restatement of the stock-based employee compensation expense disclosures for fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004 included in Note 1 to its previously issued financial statements contained in its 2004 10-K together with the associated disclosure for the first three quarters of fiscal 2003 and 2004. In addition, the Company will also incorporate these corrections to its disclosure for stock-based employee compensation expense in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2005.

(b) All payroll deductions made for a participant shall be credited to his or her account under the Plan and shall be withheld in whole percentages only. A participant may not make any additional payments into such account.
 
(c) A participant may discontinue his or her participation in the Plan as provided in Section 10 hereof, or may increase or decrease the rate of his or her payroll deductions during the Offering Period by completing or filing with the Company a new subscription agreement authorizing a change in payroll deduction rate. The Administrator may, in its discretion, limit the number of participation rate changes during any Offering Period. The change in rate shall be effective with the first full payroll period following five (5) business days after the Company's receipt of the new subscription agreement unless the Company elects to process a given change in participation more quickly. A participant's subscription agreement shall remain in effect for successive Offering Periods unless terminated as provided in Section 10 hereof.
 
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent necessary to comply with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and Section 3(b) hereof, a participant's payroll deductions may be decreased to zero percent (0%) at any time during an Offering Period. Payroll deductions shall recommence at the rate provided in such participant's subscription agreement at the beginning of the first Offering Period which is scheduled to end in the following calendar year, unless terminated by the participant as provided in Section 10 hereof.

In no event shall an Employee be permitted to purchase during each Offering Period more than 1,000 shares (subject to any adjustment pursuant to Section 21). All such purchases shall also be subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 3(b) and 13 hereof. Exercise of the option shall occur as provided in Section 8 hereof, unless the participant has withdrawn pursuant to Section 10 hereof. The Employee may accept the grant of such option by turning in a completed and signed subscription agreement to the Company prior to the first day of the Offering Period. The administrator may, for future Offering Periods, increase or decrease, in its absolute discretion, the maximum number of shares of the Company's Common Stock an Employee may purchase during an Offering Period. The option shall expire on the last day of the Offering Period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Administrator may establish different enrollment deadlines for participation in an Offering Period and/or different methods for making decisions.
Grant of Option
 
8. . Unless a participant withdraws from the Plan as provided in Section 10 hereof, his or her option for the purchase of shares shall be exercised automatically on the Exercise Date, and the maximum number of full shares subject to option shall be purchased for such participant at the applicable Purchase Price with the accumulated payroll deductions in his or her account. No fractional shares shall be purchased; any payroll deductions accumulated in a participant's account which are not sufficient to purchase a full share shall be retained in the participant's account for the subsequent Offering Period, subject to earlier withdrawal by the participant as provided in Section 10 hereof. Any other accumulated payroll deductions left over in a participant's account after the Exercise Date (e.g., because a participant has reached one of the limits on share purchases under the Plan) shall be returned to the participant. During a participant's lifetime, a participant's option to purchase shares hereunder is exercisable only by him or her.
Exercise of Option
 
9. . As promptly as practicable after each Exercise Date on which a purchase of shares occurs, the Company shall arrange the delivery to each participant, as appropriate, of a certificate representing the shares purchased upon exercise of his or her option.
Delivery
 
10. .
Withdrawal
 
(a) A participant may withdraw all but not less than all the payroll deductions credited to his or her account and not yet used to exercise his or her option under the Plan at any time by giving written notice to the Company in the form prescribed by the Administrator. All of the participant's payroll deductions credited to his or her account shall be paid to such participant promptly after receipt of notice of withdrawal and such participant's option for the Offering Period shall be automatically terminated, and no further payroll deductions for the purchase of shares shall be made for such Offering Period. If a participant withdraws from an Offering Period, payroll deductions shall not resume at the beginning of the succeeding Offering Period unless the participant delivers to the Company a new subscription agreement.
 
(b) A participant's withdrawal from an Offering Period shall not have any effect upon his or her eligibility to participate in any similar plan which may hereafter be adopted by the Company or in succeeding Offering Periods which commence after the termination of the Offering Period from which the participant withdraws.
 
11. . Upon a participant's ceasing to be an Employee for any reason, he or she shall be deemed to have elected to withdraw from the Plan and the payroll deductions credited to such participant's account during the Offering Period but not yet used to exercise the option shall be returned to such participant or, in the case of his or her death, to the person or persons entitled thereto under Section 17 hereof, and such participant's option shall be automatically terminated. The preceding sentence notwithstanding, a participant who receives payment in lieu of notice of termination of employment shall be treated as continuing to be an Employee for the participant's customary number of hours per week of employment during the period in which the participant is subject to such payment in lieu of notice.
Termination of Employment
 
12.. No interest shall accrue on the payroll deductions of a participant in the Plan.
Interest
 
13. .
Stock
 
(a) The maximum of 2,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock shall be available for issuance pursuant to the Plan, subject to adjustment upon changes in the capitalization of the Company as provided in Section 21 hereof. If, on a given Exercise Date, the number of shares with respect to which options are to be exercised exceeds the number of shares then available under the Plan, the Company shall make a pro rata allocation of the shares remaining available for purchase in as uniform a manner as shall be practicable and as it shall determine to be equitable.
 
(b) The participant shall have no interest or voting right in shares covered by his or her option until such option has been exercised.
 
(c) Shares to be delivered to a participant under the Plan shall be registered in the name of the participant or in the name of the participant and his or her spouse.
 
14. .
Restricted Stock
 
(a) . Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Administrator, at any time and from time to time, may grant shares of Restricted Stock to participants based on payroll deductions used to purchase shares pursuant to the Plan. Such grants may be made for an Offering Period only if the Purchase Price for options exercisable for the Offering period is at least 100% of Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Exercise Date. Restricted Stock grants may be made in such amounts as prescribed by the Administrator from time to time, but the Fair Market Value (determined as of the Exercise Date) of Restricted Stock granted to any participant for an Offering Period (combined with any Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to the Plan for the same Offering Period) will not exceed 25% of such participant's payroll deductions used to purchase shares pursuant to the Plan. The Administrator shall have discretion to establish uniform and nondiscriminatory procedures regarding eligibility and other conditions for Restricted Stock Grants, subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan.
Matching Grants
 
(b) . Each grant of Restricted Stock will be evidenced by a Restricted Stock Agreement that will specify the Period of Restriction, if any, the number of shares granted, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine. Unless the Administrator determines otherwise, shares of Restricted Stock will be held by the Company as escrow agent until the restrictions on such shares have lapsed.
Restricted Stock Agreement
 
(c) . Except as provided in this Section 14, Shares of Restricted Stock may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated until the end of the applicable Period of Restriction.
Transferability
 
(d) . The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may impose such other restrictions on shares of Restricted Stock as it may deem advisable or appropriate.
Other Restrictions
 
(e) . The Administrator, in its discretion, may legend the certificates representing Restricted Stock to give appropriate notice of such restrictions.
Legend on Certificates
 
(f) . Except as otherwise provided in this Section 14, Shares of Restricted Stock covered by each Restricted Stock grant made under the Plan will be released from escrow as soon as practicable after the last day of the Period of Restriction.
Removal of Restrictions
 
(g) . During the Period of Restriction, participants holding shares of Restricted Stock granted hereunder may exercise full voting rights with respect to those Shares, unless the Administrator determines otherwise.
Voting Rights
 
(h) . During the Period of Restriction, participants holding shares of Restricted Stock will be entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to such shares unless otherwise provided in the Restricted Stock Agreement. If any such dividends or distributions are paid in shares, the shares will be subject to the same restrictions on transferability and forfeitability as the shares of Restricted Stock with respect to which they were paid.
Dividends and Other Distributions
 
(i) . On the date set forth in the Restricted Stock Agreement, the Restricted Stock for which restrictions have not lapsed will revert to the Company and again will become available for grant under the Plan.
Return of Restricted Stock to Company
 
15. .
Restricted Stock Units
 
(a) . Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Administrator, at any time and from time to time, may grant Restricted Stock Units to participants based on payroll deductions used to purchase shares pursuant to the Plan. Such grants may be made for an Offering Period only if the Purchase Price for options exercisable for the Offering period is at least 100% of Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Exercise Date. Restricted Stock Units may be granted in such amounts as prescribed
Matching Grants
by the Administrator from time to time, but the Fair Market Value (determined as of the Exercise Date) of Restricted Stock Units granted to any participant for any Offering Period (combined with any Restricted
 
Stock granted pursuant to the Plan for the same Offering Period) will not exceed 25% of such participant's payroll deductions used to purchase shares pursuant to the Plan. The Administrator shall have discretion to establish uniform and nondiscriminatory procedures regarding eligibility and other conditions for Restricted Stock Units, subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan.
 
(b) . Each Restricted Stock Unit grant shall be evidenced by a Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement that shall specify such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall determine, including all terms, conditions, and restrictions related to the grant, the number of Restricted Stock Units and the form of payout.
Grant Agreement
 
(c) . The Administrator shall set vesting criteria in its discretion, which, depending on the extent to which the criteria are met, will determine the number of Restricted Stock Units that will be paid out to a participant.
Vesting Criteria
 
(d) . Upon meeting the applicable vesting criteria, the Participant shall be entitled to receive a payout as specified in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement.
Earning Restricted Stock Units
 
(e) . Payment of earned Restricted Stock Units shall be made as soon as practicable after the date(s) set forth in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement. The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may pay earned Restricted Stock Units in cash, shares of Company Common Stock, or a combination thereof. Shares of Company Common Stock represented by Restricted Stock Units that are fully paid in cash again shall be available for grant under the Plan.
Form and Timing of Payment
 
(f) . On the date set forth in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement, all unearned Restricted Stock Units shall be forfeited to the Company.
Cancellation
 
16..

(a) The Plan shall be administered by the Board or a committee of members of the Board appointed by the Board.
 
(b) The Administrator shall have full and exclusive discretionary authority to supervise the administration and control its operation in accordance with its terms, including, but not by way of limitation, the following discretionary powers:
 
(i) To construe, interpret and apply the terms of the Plan, to determine eligibility and to adjudicate all disputed claims filed under the Plan;
 
(ii) To determine the time or times when, and the number of shares for which, options shall be granted;

(v) To establish, from time to time, rules for performance of its powers and duties for the administration of the Plan; and
 
(vi) To determine the frequency and amounts of any Matching Contributions, which shall be granted for an Offering Period only if the Purchase Price for options exercisable for the Offering period is at least 100% of Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Exercise Date.
 
(c) Every finding, decision and determination made by the Administrator shall, to the full extent permitted by law, be final and binding upon all parties.
 
(d) . Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 16, in the event that Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or any successor provision ("Rule 16b-3") provides specific requirements for the administration of plans of this type, the Plan shall be administered only by such a body and in such a manner as shall comply with the
Rule 16b-3 Limitations
 
applicable requirements of Rule 16b-3. Unless permitted by Rule 16b-3, no discretion concerning decisions regarding the Plan shall be afforded to any committee or person that is not "disinterested" as that term is used in Rule 16b-3.
 
17. .
Designation of Beneficiary
 
(a) A participant may file a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any shares and cash, if any, from the participant's account under the Plan in the event of such participant's death subsequent to an Exercise Date on which the option is exercised but prior to delivery to such participant of such shares and cash. In addition, a participant may file a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any cash from the participant's account under the Plan in the event of such participant's death prior to exercise of the option.

(c) In the event the Board determines that the ongoing operation of the Plan may result in unfavorable financial accounting consequences, the Board may, in its discretion and, to the extent necessary or desirable, modify or amend the Plan to reduce or eliminate such accounting consequence including, but not limited to:
 
(i) altering the Purchase Price for any Offering Period including an Offering Period underway at the time of the change in Purchase Price;

Stock Options
 
(a) .
Limitations
 
(i) Each Option shall be designated in the Award Agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. However, notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For purposes of this Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted. The Fair Market Value of the Shares shall be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.
 
(ii) No Participant shall be granted, in any Fiscal Year, Options to purchase more than 1,000,000 Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, in connection with his or her initial service as an Employee, an Employee may be granted Options to purchase up to an additional 1,000,000 Shares.
 
(iii) The foregoing limitations shall be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Company's capitalization as described in Section 13.
 
(iv) If an Option is cancelled in the same Fiscal Year of the Company in which it was granted (other than in connection with a transaction described in Section 13), the cancelled Option will be counted against the limits set forth in subsections (i) and (ii) above. For this purpose, if the exercise price of an Option is reduced, the transaction will be treated as a cancellation of the Option and the grant of a new Option.
 
(b) . The term of each Option shall be stated in the Award Agreement. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the term shall be ten (10) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement. Moreover, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Incentive Stock Option shall be five (5) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement.

b) granted to any Employee other than an Employee described in paragraph (A) immediately above, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
 
(B) In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.

(D) other Shares which, in the case of Shares acquired directly or indirectly from the Company, (x) have been owned by the Participant for more than six months on the date of surrender, and (y) have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which said Option shall be exercised;
 
(E) consideration received by the Company under a cashless exercise program implemented by the Company in connection with the Plan;

Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Award Agreement and the Plan. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in the name of the Participant or, if requested by the Participant, in the name of the Participant and his or her spouse. Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder shall exist with respect to the Optioned Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly after the Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 13 of the Plan.
 
Exercising an Option in any manner shall decrease the number of Shares thereafter available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.
 
(ii) . If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider, other than upon the Participant's death or Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for three (3) months following the Participant's termination. If, on the date of termination, the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan. If, after termination, the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified by the Administrator, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.
Termination of Relationship as a Service Provider
 
(iii) . If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider as a result of the Participant's Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Participant's termination. If, on the date of termination, the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan. If, after termination, the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.
Disability of Participant
 
(iv) . If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, the Option may be exercised following the Participant's death within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of death (but in no event may the option be exercised later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement), by the Participant's designated beneficiary, provided such beneficiary has been designated prior to Participant's death in a form acceptable to the Administrator. If no such beneficiary has been designated by the Participant, then such Option may be exercised by the personal representative of the Participant's estate or by the person(s) to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to the Participant's will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution. In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following Participant's
Death of Participant
 
death. If, at the time of death, Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall immediately revert to the Plan. If the Option is not so exercised within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.

Restricted Stock
 
(a) . Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Administrator, at any time and from time to time, may grant Shares of Restricted Stock to Employees, Directors and Consultants in such amounts as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall determine. The Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine the number of Shares to be granted to each Participant, provided that during any Fiscal Year, no Participant will receive more than an aggregate of 100,000 Shares of Restricted Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, in connection with a Participant's initial service as an Employee, an Employee may be granted an aggregate of up to an additional 250,000 Shares of Restricted Stock.
Grant of Restricted Stock
 
(b) . Each Award of Restricted Stock shall be evidenced by a Restricted Stock Agreement that shall specify the Period of Restriction, the number of Shares granted, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall determine. Unless the Administrator determines otherwise, Shares of Restricted Stock shall be held by the Company as escrow agent until the restrictions on such Shares have lapsed.
Restricted Stock Agreement
 
(c) . Except as provided in this Section 7, Shares of Restricted Stock may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated until the end of the applicable Period of Restriction.

General Restrictions
 
(ii) . For purposes of qualifying grants of Restricted Stock as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator, in its discretion, may set restrictions based upon the achievement of Performance Goals. The Performance Goals will be set by the Administrator on or before the latest date permissible to enable the Restricted Stock to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code. In granting Restricted Stock which is intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator will follow any procedures determined by it from time to time to be necessary or appropriate to ensure qualification of the Restricted Stock under Section 162(m) of the Code (e.g., in determining the Performance Goals).
Section 162(m) Performance Restrictions
 
(iii) . The Administrator, in its discretion, may legend the certificates representing Restricted Stock to give appropriate notice of such restrictions. For example, the Administrator may determine that some or all certificates representing Shares of Restricted Stock shall bear the following legend:
Legend on Certificates
 
"The sale or other transfer of the shares of stock represented by this certificate, whether voluntary, involuntary, or by operation of law, is subject to certain restrictions on transfer as set forth in the Advent Software, Inc. 2002 Stock Plan, and in a Restricted Stock Agreement. A copy of the Plan and such Restricted Stock Agreement may be obtained from the Secretary of Advent Software, Inc."
 
(e) . Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7, Shares of Restricted Stock covered by each Restricted Stock grant made under the Plan shall be released from escrow as soon as practicable after the last day of the Period of Restriction. The Administrator, in its discretion, may accelerate the time at which any restrictions shall lapse or be removed. After the restrictions have lapsed, the Participant shall be entitled to have any legend or legends under Section 7(d)(iii) removed from his or her Share certificate, and the Shares shall be freely transferable by the Participant.
Removal of Restrictions
 
(f) . During the Period of Restriction, Participants holding Shares of Restricted Stock granted hereunder may exercise full voting rights with respect to those Shares, unless the Committee determines otherwise.
Voting Rights
 
(g) . During the Period of Restriction, Participants holding Shares of Restricted Stock shall be entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to such Shares unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement. If any such dividends or distributions are paid in Shares, the Shares shall be subject to the same restrictions on transferability and forfeitability as the Shares of Restricted Stock with respect to which they were paid.
Dividends and Other Distributions
 
(h) . On the date set forth in the Award Agreement, the Restricted Stock for which restrictions have not lapsed shall revert to the Company and again shall become available for grant under the Plan.
Return of Restricted Stock to Company
 
8. .
Stock Appreciation Rights
 
(a) . Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, a SAR may be granted to Service Providers at any time and from time to time as will be determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion. The Administrator may grant Affiliated SARs, Freestanding SARs, Tandem SARs, or any combination thereof.
Grant of SARs
 
(b) . The Administrator will have complete discretion to determine the number of SARs granted to any Service Provider, provided that during any Fiscal Year, no Participant will be granted SARs covering more than 1,000,000 Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, in connection with a Participant's initial service as an Employee, an Employee may be granted SARs covering up to an additional 1,000,000 Shares.
Number of Shares
 
(c) . The Administrator, subject to the provisions of the Plan, will have complete discretion to determine the terms and conditions of SARs granted under the Plan. However, the exercise price of a Freestanding SAR will not be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the grant date. The exercise price of Tandem or Affiliated SARs will equal the exercise price of the related Option.
Exercise Price and Other Terms
 
(d) . Tandem SARs may be exercised for all or part of the Shares subject to the related Option upon the surrender of the right to exercise the equivalent portion of the related Option. A Tandem SAR may be exercised only with respect to the Shares for which its related Option is then exercisable. With respect to a Tandem SAR granted in connection with an Incentive Stock Option: (a) the Tandem SAR will expire no later than the expiration of the underlying Incentive Stock Option; (b) the value of the payout with respect to the Tandem SAR will be for no more than one hundred percent (100%) of the difference between the exercise price of the underlying Incentive Stock Option and the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the underlying Incentive Stock Option at the time the Tandem SAR is exercised; and (c) the Tandem SAR will be exercisable only when the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the Incentive Stock Option exceeds the Exercise Price of the Incentive Stock Option.
Exercise of Tandem SARs
 
(e) . An Affiliated SAR will be deemed to be exercised upon the exercise of the related Option. The deemed exercise of an Affiliated SAR will not necessitate a reduction in the number of Shares subject to the related Option.
Exercise of Affiliated SARs
 
(f) . Freestanding SARs will be exercisable on such terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine.
Exercise of Freestanding SARs
 
(g) . Each SAR grant will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the exercise price, the term of the SAR, the conditions of exercise, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine.
SAR Agreement
 
(h) . An SAR granted under the Plan will expire upon the date determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion, and set forth in the Award Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rules of Section 6(d)(ii), 6(d)(iii) and 6(d)(iv) also will apply to SARs.
Expiration of SARs
 
(i) . Upon exercise of an SAR, a Participant will be entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount determined by multiplying:
Payment of SAR Amount
 
(i) The difference between the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise over the exercise price; times
 
(ii) . At the discretion of the Administrator, the payment upon SAR exercise may be in cash, in Shares of equivalent value, or in some combination thereof. Unless the Administrator determines otherwise, SARs for which payment upon exercise is made in cash will comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder.
The number of Shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised
 
9. .
Performance Units and Performance Shares
 
(a) . Performance Units and Performance Shares may be granted to Service Providers at any time and from time to time, as will be determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion. The Administrator will have complete discretion in determining the number of Performance Units and Performance Shares granted to each Participant, provided that during any Fiscal Year, (a) no Participant will receive Performance Units having an initial value greater than $2,000,000 and (b) no Participant will receive more than 100,000 Performance Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, in connection with a Participant's initial service as an Employee, an Employee may be granted up to an additional 250,000 Performance Shares.
Grant of Performance Units/Shares
 
(b) . Each Performance Unit will have an initial value that is established by the Administrator on or before the date of grant. Each Performance Share will have an initial value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant.
Value of Performance Units/Shares
 
(c) . The Administrator will set performance objectives in its discretion which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number or value of Performance Units/Shares that will be paid out to the Participants. The time period during which the performance objectives must be met will be called the "Performance Period." Each Award of Performance Units/Shares will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the Performance Period, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine.
Performance Objectives and Other Terms
 
(i) . The Administrator may set performance objectives based upon the achievement of Company-wide, divisional, or individual goals, applicable federal or state securities laws, or any other basis determined by the Administrator in its discretion.
General Performance Objectives
 
(ii) . For purposes of qualifying grants of Performance Units/Shares as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee, in its discretion, may determine that the performance objectives applicable to Performance Units/Shares will be based on the achievement of Performance Goals. The Performance Goals will be set by the Committee on or before the latest date permissible to enable the Performance Units/Shares to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code. In granting Performance Units/Shares which are intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee will follow any procedures determined by it from time to time to be necessary or appropriate to ensure qualification of the Performance Units/Shares under Section 162(m) of the Code (e.g., in determining the Performance Goals).
Section 162(m) Performance Objectives
 
(d) . After the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Performance Units/Shares will be entitled to receive a payout of the number of Performance Units/Shares earned by the Participant over the Performance Period, to be determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding performance objectives or other vesting provisions have been achieved. After the grant of a Performance Unit/Share, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any performance objectives or other vesting provisions for such Performance Unit/Share.
Earning of Performance Units/Shares
 
(e) . Payment of earned Performance Units/Shares will be made as soon as practicable after the expiration of the applicable Performance Period. The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may pay earned Performance Units/Shares in the form of cash, in Shares (which have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the value of the earned Performance Units/Shares at the close of the applicable Performance Period) or in a combination thereof.
Form and Timing of Payment of Performance Units/Shares
 
(f) . On the date set forth in the Award Agreement, all unearned or unvested Performance Units/Shares will be forfeited to the Company, and again will be available for grant under the Plan.
Cancellation of Performance Units/Shares
 
10. . Restricted Stock Units shall consist of Restricted Stock, Performance Share or Performance Unit Awards that the Administrator, in its sole discretion permits to be paid out in installments or on a deferred basis, in accordance with rules and procedures established by the Administrator. Awards may be paid out to Participants in the form of cash or Shares at the Administrator's discretion. The Administrator will have complete discretion in determining the number of Restricted Stock Units granted to each Participant, provided that during any Fiscal Year, (a) no Participant will receive more than 100,000 Restricted Stock Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, in connection with a Participant's initial service as an Employee, the Participant may be granted up to an additional 250,000 Restricted Stock Units.
Restricted Stock Units
 
11. . Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, Awards may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Participant, only by the Participant. If the Administrator makes an Award transferable, such Award shall contain such additional terms and conditions as the Administrator deems appropriate. Options may not be transferred to a third party for consideration without the approval of Company stockholders.
Transferability of Awards
 
12. . Unless the Administrator provides otherwise, vesting of Awards granted hereunder will be suspended during any unpaid leave of absence. A Service Provider will not cease to be an Employee in the case of (i) any leave of absence approved by the Company or (ii) transfers between locations of the Company or between the Company, its Parent, or any Subsidiary. For purposes of Incentive Stock Options, no such leave may exceed ninety (90) days, unless reemployment upon expiration of such leave is guaranteed by statute or contract. If reemployment upon expiration of a leave of absence approved by the Company is not so guaranteed, then three (3) months following the 91st day of such leave any Incentive Stock Option held by the participant will cease to be treated as an Incentive Stock Option and will be treated for tax purposes as a Nonstatutory Stock Option.
Leaves of Absence
 
13. .
Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization, Merger or Change in Control
 
(a) . Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company, the number of shares of Common Stock that have been authorized for issuance under the Plan but as to which no Awards have yet been granted or which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration of an Award, the number of shares of Common Stock as well as the price per share of Common Stock covered by each such outstanding Award, and the numerical Share limits in Sections 3, 6, 7(a), 8(b), 9(a) and 10 shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Common Stock, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration." Such adjustment shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of Common Stock subject to an Award.
Changes in Capitalization
 
(b) . In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator shall notify each Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction. The Administrator in its discretion may provide for a Participant to have the right to exercise his or her Award until ten (10) days prior to such transaction as to all of the Optioned Stock covered thereby, including Shares as to which the Award would not otherwise be exercisable. In addition, the Administrator may provide that any Company repurchase option applicable to any Restricted Stock shall lapse as to all such Shares, provided the proposed dissolution or liquidation takes place at the time and in the manner contemplated. To the extent it has not been previously exercised, an Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action.
Dissolution or Liquidation
 
(c) . In the event of a merger of the Company with or into another corporation, or a Change in Control, each outstanding Award shall be assumed or an equivalent option or right substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation.
Merger or Change in Control
 
In the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Award, the Participant shall fully vest in and have the right to exercise his or her Options or Stock Appreciation Right as to all of the Optioned Stock, including Shares as to which such Awards would not otherwise be vested or exercisable. All restrictions on Restricted Stock and, with respect to Performance Shares and Performance Units, all Performance Goals or other vesting criteria will be as determined by the Board. In addition, if an Option or Stock Appreciation Right becomes fully vested and exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a Change in Control, the Administrator shall notify the Participant in writing or electronically that the Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall be fully vested and exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and the Option or Stock Purchase Right shall terminate upon the expiration of such period.
 
For the purposes of this subsection (c), an Award shall be considered assumed if, following the merger or Change in Control, the Award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the merger or Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) or, in the case of a Stock Appreciation Right upon the exercise of which the Administrator determines to pay cash or a Performance Share or Performance Unit which the Administrator can determine to pay in cash, the fair market value of the consideration received in the Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the merger or Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right or upon the payout of a Performance Share or Performance Unit, for each Share subject to such Award (or in the case of Performance Units, the number of implied shares determined by dividing the value of the Performance Units by the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control), to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or Change in Control.
 
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 13(c) to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more Performance Goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such Performance Goals without the Participant's consent; provided, however, a modification to such Performance Goals only to reflect the successor corporation's post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.
 
14. . Neither the Plan nor any Award shall confer upon a Participant any right with respect to continuing the Participant's relationship as a Service Provider with the Company, nor shall they interfere in any way with the Participant's right or the Company's right to terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause.
No Effect on Employment or Service
 
15. . The date of grant of an Award shall be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the determination granting such Award, or such other later date as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination shall be provided to each Participant within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.
Date of Grant
 
16. . Subject to Section 21 of the Plan, the Plan shall become effective upon its adoption by the Board. It shall continue in effect for a term of ten (10) years unless terminated earlier under Section 17 of the Plan.
Term of Plan
 
17. .
Amendment and Termination of the Plan
 
(a) . The Board may at any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan.
Amendment and Termination
 
(b) . The Company shall obtain stockholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with Applicable Laws.
Stockholder Approval
 
(c) . No amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan shall impair the rights of any Participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Participant and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Participant and the Company. Termination of the Plan shall not affect the Administrator's ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Options granted under the Plan prior to the date of such termination.
Effect of Amendment or Termination
 
18. .
Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares
 
(a) . Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with Applicable Laws and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
Legal Compliance
 
(b) . As a condition to the exercise of an Award, the Company may require the person exercising such Award to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required.
Investment Representations
 
19. . The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.
Inability to Obtain Authority
 
20. . The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.
Reservation of Shares
 
21. . The Plan shall be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is adopted. Such stockholder approval shall be obtained in the manner and to the degree required under Applicable Laws.
Stockholder Approval

Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
 
On May 26, 2005, Advent Software, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a definitive agreement with American Securities, L.P. ("American"), whereby the Company will sub-lease to American one floor of the Company's leased property located at 666 Third Avenue in New York, New York. The Company currently estimates that the associated facility exit costs and cash expenditures will be up to approximately $2.5 million, which include costs to terminate the operating lease and other associated costs. At the time the Company vacates the property, which it currently expects will occur prior to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2005, American will begin sub-leasing the property and the Company will incur the facility exit costs. This exit plan was implemented to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies through the reduction of excess facility space.

A stockholder's notice to the secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting: (A) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (B) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation's books, of the stockholder proposing such business, (C) the class and number of shares of the corporation that are beneficially owned by the stockholder, (D) any material interest of the stockholder in such business, and (E) any other information that is required to be provided by the stockholder pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to include information with respect to a stockholder proposal in the proxy statement and form of proxy for a stockholder's meeting, stockholders must provide notice as required by the regulations promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (a). The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (a), and, if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting that any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
 
(b) Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b) shall be eligible for election as directors. Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors of the corporation may be made at a meeting of stockholders by or at the direction of the board of directors or by any stockholder of the corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this paragraph (b). Such nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the board of directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the secretary of the corporation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Section 2.5. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (i) as to each person, if any, whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director: (A) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (B) the principal occupation or employment of such person, (C) the class and number of shares of the corporation that are beneficially owned by such person, (D) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nominations are to be made by the stockholder, and (E) any other information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for elections of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including without limitation such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement, if any, as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); and (ii) as to such stockholder giving notice, the information required to be provided pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 2.5. At the request of the board of directors, any person nominated by a stockholder for election as a director shall furnish to the secretary of the corporation that information required to be set forth in the stockholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b). The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these bylaws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting, and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
 
These provisions shall not prevent the consideration and approval or disapproval at an annual meeting of reports of officers, directors and committees of the board of directors, but in connection therewith no new business shall be acted upon at any such meeting unless stated, filed and received as herein provided. Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the contrary, no business brought before a meeting by a stockholder shall be conducted at an annual meeting except in accordance with procedures set forth in this Section 2.5.

2.15
INSPECTORS OF ELECTION
 
Before any meeting of stockholders, the board of directors may appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment.

The number of inspectors shall be either one (1) or three (3). If inspectors are appointed at a meeting pursuant to the request of one (1) or more stockholders or proxies, then the holders of a majority of the voting power of shares or their proxies present at the meeting shall determine whether one (1) or three (3) inspectors are to be appointed. If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, then the chairperson of the meeting may, and upon the request of any stockholder or a stockholder's proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy.
 
Such inspectors shall:

Vacancies in the board of directors may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director; however, a vacancy created by the removal of a director by the vote of the stockholders or by court order may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present (which shares voting affirmatively also constitute a majority of the required quorum). Each director so elected shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders and until a successor has been elected and qualified.
 
Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws:
 
(i) Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
 
(ii) Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected.
 
If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
 
If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten(10) percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable.
 
3.5

For purposes of this Section 6.1, a "director" or "officer" of the corporation shall mean any person (i) who is or was a director or officer of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was a director or officer of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.

The corporation shall pay the expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred by a director or officer of the corporation entitled to indemnification hereunder in defending any action, suit or proceeding referred to in this Section 6.1 in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that payment of expenses incurred by a director or officer of the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the director or officer to repay all amounts advanced if it should ultimately be determined that the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 6.1 or otherwise.
 
The rights conferred on any person by this Article shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, these bylaws, agreement, vote of the stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

For purposes of this Section 6.2, an "employee" or "agent" of the corporation (other than a director or officer) shall mean any person (i) who is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was an employee or agent of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.

6.4
SAVINGS CLAUSE
 
If this Article VI or any portion thereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation against expenses (including attorney's fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, and whether internal or external, including a grand jury proceeding and an action or suit brought by or in the right of the corporation, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law.
 
6.5
CONTINUATION OF INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES
 
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VI shall, unless otherwise prided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
 
6.6
NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS
 
The rights conferred on any person by this bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office. The corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
 
6.7
AMENDMENTS
 
Any repeal or modification of this bylaw shall only be prospective and shall not affect the rights under this bylaw in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that is the cause of any proceeding against any agent of the corporation.
 
 
 
7.1
MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS
 
The corporation shall, either at its principal executive office or at such place or places as designated by the board of directors, keep a record of its stockholders listing their names and addresses and the number and class of shares held by each stockholder, a copy of these bylaws as amended to date, accounting books and other records of its business and properties.
 
Any stockholder of record, in person or by attorney or other agent, shall, upon written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof, have the right during the usual hours for business to inspect for any proper purpose the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and records and to make copies or extracts therefrom. A proper purpose shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a stockholder. In every instance where an attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the right to inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act on behalf of the stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the corporation at its registered office in Delaware or at its principal place of business.
 
7.2
INSPECTION BY DIRECTORS
 
Any director shall have the right to examine the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders and its other books and records for a purpose reasonably related to his or her position as a director.
 
7.3
REPRESENTATION OF SHARES OF OTHER CORPORATIONS
 
The chairman of the board, if any, the chief executive officer, the president, any vice president, the chief financial officer, the secretary or any assistant secretary of this corporation, or any other person authorized by the board of directors or the president or a vice president, is authorized to vote, represent and exercise on behalf of this corporation all rights incident to any and all shares of the stock of any other corporation or corporations standing in the name of this corporation. The authority herein granted may be exercised either by such person directly or by any other person authorized to do so by proxy or power of attorney duly executed by such person having the authority.
 
7.4
CERTIFICATION AND INSPECTION OF BYLAWS
 
The original or a copy of these bylaws, as amended or otherwise altered to date, certified by the secretary, shall be kept at the corporation's principal executive office and shall be open to inspection by the stockholders of the corporation, at all reasonable times during office hours.
 
 
 
8.1
RECORD DATE FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN NOTICE AND VOTING
 
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted and which shall not be more than sixty (60) days before any such action. In that case, only stockholders of record at the close of business on the date so fixed are entitled to receive the dividend, distribution or allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date so fixed, except as otherwise provided by law.
 
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, then the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the applicable resolution.
 
8.2
CHECKS; DRAFTS; EVIDENCES OF INDEBTEDNESS
 
From time to time, the board of directors shall determine by resolution which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness that are issued in the name of or payable to the corporation, and only the persons so authorized shall sign or endorse those instruments.
 
8.3
FISCAL YEAR
 
The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the board of directors.
 
8.4
CORPORATE CONTRACTS AND INSTRUMENTS: HOW EXECUTED
 
The board of directors, except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, may authorize and empower any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation; such power and authority may be general or confined to specific instances. Unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.
 
8.5
STOCK CERTIFICATES; TRANSFER; PARTLY PAID SHARES
 
The shares of the corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the board of directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the board of directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and, upon request, every holder of uncertificated shares, shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, the chairman or vice-chairman of the board of directors, or the president or vice-president, and by the treasurer or an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant secretary of such corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
 
Certificates for shares shall be of such form and device as the board of directors may designate and shall state the name of the record holder of the shares represented thereby; its number; date of issuance; the number of shares for which it is issued; a summary statement or reference to the powers, designations, preferences or other special rights of such stock and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights, if any; a statement or summary of liens, if any; a conspicuous notice of restrictions upon transfer or registration of transfer, if any; a statement as to any applicable voting trust agreement; if the shares be assessable, or, if assessments are collectible by personal action, a plain statement of such facts.
 
Upon surrender to the secretary or transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.
 
The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.
 
8.6
SPECIAL DESIGNATION ON CERTIFICATES
 
If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
 
8.7
LOST CERTIFICATES
 
Except as provided in this Section 8.7, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and cancelled at the same time. The board of directors may, in case any share certificate or certificate for any other security is lost, stolen or destroyed, authorize the issuance of replacement certificates on such terms and conditions as the board may require; the board may require indemnification of the corporation secured by a bond or other adequate security sufficient to protect the corporation against any claim that may be made against it, including any expense or liability, on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of the certificate or the issuance of the replacement certificate.
 
8.8
TRANSFER AGENTS AND REGISTRARS
 
The board of directors may appoint one or more transfer agents or transfer clerks, and one or more registrars, each of which shall be an incorporated bank or trust company  either domestic or foreign, who shall be appointed at such times and places as the requirements of the corporation may necessitate and the board of directors may designate.
 
8.9
CONSTRUCTION; DEFINITIONS
 
Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction and definitions in the General Corporation Law of Delaware shall govern the construction of these
 
bylaws. Without limiting the generality of this provision, as used in these bylaws, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the term "person" includes both an entity and a natural person.
 
 
 
The original or other bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon the directors. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.
 
Whenever an amendment or new bylaw is adopted, it shall be copied in the book of bylaws with the original bylaws, in the appropriate place. If any bylaw is repealed, the fact of repeal with the date of the meeting at which the repeal was enacted or the filing of the operative written consent(s) shall be stated in said book.

PERSPECTIVE
 
Advent issued the following guidance:
GUIDANCE
Q3 2005 revenues are projected to be in the range of $40 million to $42 million;
 - 
                 
Full year 2005 revenues are projected to be in the range of $162 million to $165 million;
 - 
                 
Q3 2005 expenses, including cost of revenues, are projected to be in the range of $39 million to $40million;
 - 
                 
Full year 2005 expenses are projected to be in the range of $160 million to $163 million, including amortization of intangibles;
 - 
                 
Amortization of intangibles included in cost of revenues will be approximately $600,000 per quarter, and that related to other intangibles will be approximately $1.1 million per quarter;
 - 
                 
Common shares outstanding will increase by roughly 1 percent from the second quarter ending share count of 30.4 million, excluding the possible effect of any stock repurchases; and
 - 
                 
Assuming the price of our common stock remains unchanged during Q3 2005, weighted average common shares outstanding on a diluted basis for Q3 2005 will be approximately 900,000 shares higher than on a basic basis.

ITEM 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On January 6, 2006, Advent Software, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a definitive lease agreement with Toda Development, Inc. (the "Landlord") whereby the Company will lease approximately 95,000 square feet of office space at 600 Townsend Street in San Francisco, California. The Company's contractual operating lease obligation under this agreement is approximately $20 million, payable over the ten-year term of the lease. Additionally, the Company anticipates approximately $7.6 million of leasehold improvements, of which $3.8 million will be funded by the Landlord and approximately $3.8 million will be paid directly by Advent. The rental period under the Lease commences 10 days after substantial completion of the tenant improvements by the Landlord. After delivery of the improved premises, currently estimated by Landlord's general contractor to be in the third fiscal quarter of 2006, the Company will exit its current corporate headquarter facilities and relocate to the 600 Townsend facility. The leases on the current facilities expire on December 31, 2006 and October 31, 2008. Advent therefore anticipates incurring a restructuring charge, principally related to the lease expiring on October 31, 2008, when the Company relocates to the 600 Townsend facility.

During the period of such early access, (i) Tenant shall be solely responsible for any equipment, fixtures, furniture or material brought into the Premises in connection with such early occupancy, and for any loss or damage thereto from any cause whatsoever, excluding only the gross negligence or deliberate misconduct of Landlord or Landlord's contractors, and (ii) Tenant shall cooperate with Landlord to facilitate the completion of the Tenant Improvements, provided that Landlord shall ensure that the Premises are substantially free of Landlord's contractors in order to maximize the benefits to Tenant of the Move In Period.

During the Move In Period, Tenant shall be subject to all of the covenants in this Lease, except that Tenant's obligation to pay Base Rent or Additional Rent shall commence on the Commencement Date or such other date specified in this Lease.  If Tenant commences its occupancy of the Premises prior to expiration of the Move In Period for the purpose of conducting Tenant's business, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.3 or the provisions of the Basic Lease Information to the contrary, the Commencement Date of the Lease shall be the date Tenant so commenced its occupancy of the Premises for the purpose of conducting Tenant's business.

Base Real Estate Taxes
 
During the last month of each calendar year preceding a Computation Year (or as soon thereafter as practicable), Landlord shall give Tenant notice of Landlord's estimate of the amount payable by Tenant under Section 4.1(a) for the following Computation Year.  On or before the first day of each month during the following Computation Year, Tenant shall pay to Landlord one-twelfth (1/12) of such estimated amount, provided that if Landlord fails to give such notice in the last month of the prior year, then Tenant shall continue to pay on the basis of the prior year's estimate until the first day of the calendar month next succeeding the date such notice is given by Landlord; and from the first day of the calendar month following the date such notice is given, Tenant's payments shall be adjusted so that the estimated amount for that Computation Year will be fully paid by the end of that Computation Year.  If at any time or times Landlord determines that the amount payable under Section 4.1(a) for the current Computation Year will vary from its estimate given to Tenant, Landlord, by not less than ten (10) business days' notice to Tenant, may revise its estimate for such Computation Year, and subsequent payments by Tenant for such Computation Year shall be based upon such revised estimate.

Tenant shall bear all costs of such audit, including Landlord's actual copying costs and personnel costs, if any, incurred in connection with such audit, except that, if the audit (as conducted and certified by the auditor) shows an aggregate overstatement of Operating Costs of five (5%) or more, and Landlord's auditors concur in such findings (or, in the absence of such concurrence, such overstatement is confirmed by a court of competent jurisdiction or such other dispute resolution mechanism as to which the parties mutually agree in writing), then Landlord shall bear all costs of the audit (including the cost of the dispute resolution mechanism).  If the agreed or confirmed audit shows an underpayment of Operating Costs by Tenant, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, within ten (10) business days after the audit is agreed to or confirmed, the amount owed to Landlord, and, if the agreed or confirmed audit shows an overpayment of Operating Costs by Tenant, Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for such overpayment within thirty (30) days after the audit is agreed to or confirmed.

(a)
          
 
Even though Tenant has breached this Lease and/or abandoned the Premises, this Lease shall continue in effect for so long as Landlord does not terminate Tenant's right to possession under Section 14.2(a), and Landlord may enforce all of its rights and remedies under this Lease, including (but without limitation) the right to recover Rent as it becomes due, and Landlord, without terminating this Lease, may exercise all of the rights and remedies of a landlord under Section 1951.4 of the Civil Code of the State of California or any amended or successor code section.

Such deficiency shall be calculated and paid monthly.  Tenant shall also pay to Landlord, as soon as determined, any costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in connection with such reletting or in making alterations and repairs to the Premises, which are not covered by the rent received from the reletting.

Upon such termination, in addition to any other rights and remedies to which Landlord may be entitled under applicable law, Landlord shall be entitled to recover from Tenant:  (i) the worth at the time of award of the unpaid Rent and other amounts which had been earned at the time of termination; (ii) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such Rent loss that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; (iii) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent for the balance of the Term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such Rent loss that Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided; and (iv) any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all the detriment proximately caused by Tenant's failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or which, in the ordinary course of things, would be likely to result therefrom.  The "worth at the time of award" of the amounts referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) shall be computed with interest at the lesser of ten percent (10%) per annum or the maximum rate then allowed by law.  The "worth at the time of award" of the amount referred to in clause (iii) shall be computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of the award plus one percent (1%).
(c)
          
.  For purposes of computing unpaid Rent which would have accrued and become payable under this Lease, unpaid Rent shall consist of the sum of: (1) the total Base Rent for the balance of the Term, plus (2) a computation of Tenant's Proportionate Share of Increased Operating Cost and Real Estate Taxes for the balance of the Term, the assumed amount for the calendar year of the default and each future calendar year in the Term to be equal to Tenant's Proportionate Share of Increased Operating Cost and Real Estate Taxes for the calendar year immediately prior to the year in which default occurs, compounded at a per annum rate equal to the mean average rate of inflation for the preceding five (5) calendar years as determined by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index (All Urban Consumers, all items (1982-84 = 100)) for the metropolitan area in which the Project is located.  If such Index is discontinued or revised, the average rate of inflation shall be determined by reference to the index designated as the successor or substitute index by the government of the United States.
14.3
       
Computation of Rent for Purposes of Default
 
.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth elsewhere in this Lease, in the event Tenant fails to perform any affirmative duty or obligation of Tenant under this Lease, then, after the expiration of any applicable grace or cure period (unless waiting for such period to expire would jeopardize the health, safety or quiet enjoyment of the Building by its tenants and occupants or cause further damage or loss to Landlord or the Project, as reasonably determined by Landlord, or result in any violation (or continuance of any violation) of any legal requirement) Landlord may after written notice to Tenant (and without notice in case of an emergency) (but shall not be obligated to) perform such duty or obligation on Tenant's behalf, including, without limitation, the obtaining of insurance policies or governmental licenses, permits or approvals.  Tenant shall reimburse Landlord upon demand for the costs and expenses of any such performance (including penalties, interest and attorneys' fees incurred in connection therewith).  Such costs and expenses incurred by Landlord shall be deemed Additional Rent hereunder.
14.4
       
Landlord's Right to Perform
 
.  All rights, privileges and elections or remedies of Landlord are cumulative and not alternative with all other rights and remedies at law or in equity to the fullest extent permitted by law.
14.5
       
Remedies Cumulative
 
.  Tenant waives any right of redemption or relief from forfeiture under California Civil Code Section 3275 and California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1174 and 1179, or under any other present or future law in the event Tenant is evicted and Landlord takes possession of the Premises by reason of a default.

Waiver
 
.  If Tenant shall cure a General Default (as defined in Section 14.1(c) above) within the time period provided for such cure pursuant to Section 14.1(c) above, but shall again fail to comply with the same provision of this Lease within three (3) months after Landlord's written notice of the original default, then in addition to any of Landlord's rights under this Lease in connection with such subsequent General Default, Tenant shall pay Landlord the sum of Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500.00) within five (5) business days of Landlord's demand therefor, which Tenant agrees is reasonable compensation for Landlord's agreement hereunder to provide Tenant with the opportunity to cure repetitive General Defaults of the same provision of this Lease, rather than to provide that any subsequent General Default is an Event of Default immediately and without further opportunity to cure.

ARTICLE 15. SURRENDER; HOLDING OVER
 
.  Subject to the provisions of Article 8 hereof, on the Expiration Date (or earlier termination of this Lease), Tenant shall quit and surrender possession of the Premises to Landlord in as good order and condition as they were in on the Commencement Date, reasonable wear and tear, taking by condemnation and repairs which are Landlord's responsibility excepted, and damage from casualty to improvements other than the Tenant Improvements and other improvements paid for from allowances provided by Landlord excepted.

Landlord shall apply the proceeds of any such sale as follows: first, to the costs of such sale; second, to the costs of storing any such property; third, to the payment of any other sums of money which may then or thereafter be due to Landlord from Tenant under any of the terms of this Lease; and fourth, the balance, if any, to Tenant.

Construction
 
.  In no event may the Equipment interfere with any Building services or with any other providers of services to the Building or with the reception of or signal from any other antenna or satellite dish presently or hereinafter erected at the Project, including the Building. If the operation of the Equipment interferes with any such other service or antenna or satellite dish then, immediately following written notice from Landlord to Tenant of such interference, Tenant shall eliminate such interference. If Tenant is unable to promptly eliminate such interference, then Landlord may, upon further written notice to Tenant, terminate Tenant's license with respect to the License Areas and Tenant shall immediately cease operation of the Equipment and remove the Equipment from the License Areas pursuant to Section 21.7 below. Landlord and Tenant shall cooperate with each other at all times during the term of this Lease so as to minimize interference between the Equipment and other communications equipment in the Building or on the Building's roof, regardless of the installation dates of the Equipment or such other equipment.
21.5
       
Interference by Equipment
 
.  Tenant agrees that Tenant shall not sell communication services or use the Equipment to provide services to any other party.

If Tenant retains possession of the License Areas licensed hereunder or any part thereof after the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease or the license granted herein, then, unless Landlord expressly agrees otherwise in writing, Tenant shall pay Landlord during such holdover period, on a monthly basis, the fair market rental for the affected space, as reasonably determined by Landlord, together with all damages sustained by Landlord on account thereof. Any failure by Tenant to remove any Equipment following written demand for the same by Landlord pursuant to the provisions of this Section 21.1(g) shall constitute continuing possession for purposes of the immediately preceding sentence.
21.7
       
Removal of Equipment
 
.  Subject to the rules and regulations of the Building, Tenant shall have the right, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, but under the supervision of Landlord, to enter upon the License Areas during normal business hours and weekends and to construct, install, operate and maintain the Equipment, until the Lease or the license granted hereunder terminates. Tenant may have access to the License Areas for normal repairs during normal business hours upon not less than four (4) hours' prior telephone notice to the engineer for the Building during normal business hours, and may have access to the License Areas for repairs during non business hours provided that Tenant provides Landlord with adequate advance notice thereof. Tenant shall designate in writing to Landlord the appropriate authorized person or persons the Tenant will use to make emergency repairs to the Equipment and shall cause such persons to comply with such safety and security procedures (including, without limitation, orientation and training) as Landlord shall establish from time to time. Following such designation and upon presenting satisfactory identification to Landlord's Building security personnel together with a brief description of the reason for the emergency entry, and subject to compliance with Landlord's safety and security procedures, such authorized person(s) may enter upon the portions of the Building where the Equipment is located to perform emergency repairs to the Equipment.

Notwithstanding any provision of this Lease to the contrary, the Equipment shall be in or on the Building at the sole risk of Tenant and Landlord shall not be liable for damage thereto or theft, misappropriation or loss thereof, and Tenant hereby waives all claims against Landlord in connection therewith. In the event of an interruption in, or failure or inability to provide electricity to the Equipment, such interruption shall not impose upon Landlord any liability whatsoever (including, without limitation, liability for consequential damages or loss of business by Tenant) and Tenant hereby waives all claims against Landlord or its agents or employees for any loss or damage resulting from any such interruption. Further, notwithstanding any provision of this Lease to the contrary, except to the extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord or its agents or contractors, Tenant agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Landlord, and Landlord's agents and employees and the holders of any interest in Landlord and/or the Building from and against any and all claims, which result from or arise out of (i) the installation, operation, existence, maintenance, repair, removal, replacement or relocation of the Equipment, (ii) any construction or other work undertaken by or on behalf of Tenant in or about the License Areas, or (iii) any breach or default under this Article 21 by Tenant, whether any of the foregoing occurs on the Antenna Site, the other License

Areas or any other place within or without the Building and whether occurring prior to, during or subsequent to the term of this Lease. This Section 21.9 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Lease.
 
. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that it accepts the Antenna Site in its "as is" condition. Tenant, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, shall keep the Equipment in good and safe condition and repair and free of any defects (except for damage caused by the willful misconduct of Landlord or its agents or representatives), including, without limitation, correcting any loose bolts, fittings or other appurtenances. If the Antenna Site is damaged as a result of Tenant's failure to properly maintain the Equipment, Tenant, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, shall promptly repair such damage.

21.10
     
Maintenance; Repair
 
.  At any time or times hereafter, in addition to the rights reserved by Landlord under any other provisions of this Lease, Landlord may require upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice that Tenant move all or any portion of the Equipment (including any Lines) to another location or locations in or on the Building. If Landlord exercises any such rights, the parties agree that: (i) Landlord shall pay all reasonable, direct out of pocket expenses incurred by Tenant in connection therewith (excluding lost profits or other consequential damages), unless the exercise of such rights is necessary for the safety, access, use, repair, maintenance or operation of the Building including, without limitation, the repair or replacement of the roof, as determined by Landlord in its sole discretion, in which event Tenant shall bear such expenses, and (ii) Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to provide other space in the Building that will be feasible for Tenant's purposes (but the installation of new Equipment or improvements or alterations in or to License Areas or Equipment therein shall be subject to Landlord's approval of the drawings therefor and the other requirements set forth in the other provisions of this Article 21).
21.11
     
Relocation and Substitution
 
.  A fire or other casualty or a taking affecting the License Areas or the Equipment shall not affect the obligations of Tenant under this Lease, and this Lease shall remain in full force and effect, without any abatement of any amounts payable to Landlord hereunder.  Landlord shall be entitled to all compensation, damages, income, rent awards and interest thereon whatsoever which may be paid or made in connection with any taking of the License Areas, and Tenant shall have no claim against Landlord or any governmental authority for the value of any unexpired term of its rights under this Article 21; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit Tenant from prosecuting a separate claim against the taking authority for an amount separately designated for the Equipment, so long as any award to Tenant will not reduce the award to Landlord.
21.12
     
Damage or Destruction; Eminent Domain
 
.  The rights granted pursuant to this Article 21 are personal to Tenant and its Affiliate Transferees.  If at any time Tenant leases less than 50,000 feet of Rentable Area in the Building, Landlord shall have the right on written notice to Tenant to terminate Tenant's rights under this Article 21.

.  Landlord hereby grants Tenant a rent-free license to use the area on the roof of the Building adjacent to the Fifth Floor Premises (the "") during the term of the Lease, in accordance with the provisions of this Article 22.  Tenant shall accept the Deck License Area in its "as-is" condition. Landlord makes no representation regarding the condition of the Deck License Area or its suitability for Tenant's use. Tenant represents and warrants that all of Tenant's activities on the Deck License Area shall be conducted in a safe manner.  Tenant agrees to comply with the rules and regulations established by Landlord from time to time for the use of the Deck License Area, and to cause Tenant's employees and guests to comply with such safety and security procedures as Landlord shall establish from time to time for use of the Deck License Area. The foregoing shall in no way obligate Landlord or Landlord's Building manager to ensure the safety of persons using the Deck License Area. Without limiting the foregoing, Tenant specifically agrees that no barbeque equipment, no open flames and no smoking shall be permitted in the Deck License Area, that the License Area shall be used in a manner which does not damage the surface of the roof, and that any furnishings shall either be secured or be of a weight

such that they will not blow off the roof.  Tenant shall obtain Landlord's prior written approval of all furniture, planters, flower boxes or other items placed in the Deck License Area.  Planters and flower boxes shall be installed and used in a manner which does not damage the surface of the roof.  Tenant shall not use or permit its employees or guests to use the Deck License Area in any way which will conflict with any law, statute, ordinance or governmental rule, regulation or requirement now in force or which may hereafter be enacted or promulgated (""), and upon notice that Tenant's use of the Deck License Area is a violation of Laws, Tenant shall cease such use (and shall cause employees of Tenant to cease such use). Tenant acknowledges that notwithstanding any provision of the Lease to the contrary, Landlord shall have no obligation to repair the Deck License Area, the decking (if any), or the surrounding areas as required for or in connection with Tenant's use of the Deck License Area, and shall have no obligation to perform any alterations or modifications to cause such area to comply with applicable Laws. Tenant shall keep the Deck License Area, including the decking tiles and any related installations (such as storage lockers and railings), in a clean condition, free of debris and in good condition and repair. Tenant shall promptly reimburse Landlord for any repairs to the decking which are required as a result of Tenant's use of the Deck License Area and any increased operating costs or other costs incurred by Landlord as a result of Tenant's use of the Deck License Area. Notwithstanding any provision of the Lease to the contrary, any personal property of Tenant on the Deck License Area shall be in or on the Building at the sole risk of Tenant and Landlord shall not be liable for damage thereto or theft, misappropriation or loss thereof, and Tenant hereby waives all claims against Landlord in connection therewith. Further, notwithstanding any provision of the Lease to the contrary, Tenant agrees that Tenant will be responsible for, and Tenant waives all claims against Landlord and the Indemnified Parties for all costs, damages or liability of whatever nature arising out of Tenant's access to the Deck License Area and Tenant agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from all claims, lawsuits, damages, expenses or costs (including direct costs arising from Tenant's use of the roof and reasonable attorney's fees) arising from or related thereto.
Laws
 
.  Tenant shall be permitted a license for non-emergency access to the three (3) stairwells located in the Northwest corner, central East side, and Southwest corner of the Building and reentry access via the emergency stairwell doors on the floors of the Building on which the Premises are located for the sole purpose of permitting Tenant's employees to use the stairwells to travel between adjacent floors of the Premises, and to and from the parking garage and the main lobby, subject to the provisions of this Section. Tenant agrees to permit only employees authorized by Tenant to have access to such stairwell access system and agrees to observe all life safety regulations imposed by Landlord, the rules and regulations of the Building, and any and all applicable laws or regulations imposed by governmental authorities. Tenant acknowledges that the Building's life safety systems may at times override Tenant's access system. Tenant further agrees that if any governmental or insurance rule, regulation or law restricts or prohibits such access or use, or if Landlord reasonably determines that such access to or use of the stairwells presents a life safety or insurance problem for the Building or otherwise unreasonably interferes with the maintenance or operation of the Building, then Landlord may revoke Tenant's rights under this Section upon written notice to Tenant. Upon the expiration or termination of the Lease with respect to that portion of the Premises located on any floor of the Building, Tenant's rights under this Section with respect to such floor of the Building shall terminate, and if at any time Tenant does not lease hereunder Premises located on a minimum of two (2) contiguous floors of the Building above the ground floor, Tenant's rights to non-emergency access to the stairwell and rights to the access system shall automatically terminate. The rights granted hereunder to Tenant are personal to Advent Software and its Affiliates and shall not inure to the benefit of any assignee of the Lease or subtenant of any portion of the Premises.  Tenant shall pay the entire cost of installation of a stairwell access system or a modification to the existing stairwell access system, and modifications to the Building's life safety systems, if any, which are required to provide Tenant the access from the stairwells, including Landlord's costs in reviewing or implementing such installations or modifications.  Such installations and modifications shall be subject to Landlord's prior approval. Upon the revocation of the license granted hereunder with respect to any floor of the Building, or the expiration or termination of this Lease, Tenant shall, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, promptly remove any magnetic key card readers or other device used to provide access from the stairwell entries for which Tenant is no longer permitted access and shall restore the magnetic key card reader area or other area to its condition prior to the installation or modification of such access system.
22.2
       
Stairwell Use
 
.  In the event Tenant breaches the provisions of this Article 22 and fails to cure such breach within five (5) business days (or within one (1) business day in the case of breaches that pose an imminent security or safety risk) after written notice from Landlord, Landlord may suspend Tenant's license to use the Deck License Area or the stairwells until such breach is cured.  If Tenant persistently breaches the same
22.3
       
Right to Revoke License
provision of this Article 22 after written notice of at least one such breach, Landlord may terminate Tenant's license to use the Deck License Area or the stairwells, as applicable.  Tenant shall not make any repairs, alterations or improvements to the Deck License Area without Landlord's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  Landlord may access the Deck License Area at any time in connection with any work Landlord desires to perform on or about the roof.  To the extent any of Landlord's work on the roof requires that the Deck License Area be temporarily vacated, Tenant shall vacate the Deck License Area during the performance of such work.  If Tenant ceases to lease the Fifth Floor Premises immediately adjacent to the Deck License Area, the license granted under Section 22.1 shall automatically terminate.

(c)
          
 
.  Tenant and its telecommunications companies, including local exchange telecommunications companies and alternative access vendor services companies, shall obtain Landlord's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) for access to and within the Building for the installation and operation of telecommunications systems, including voice, video, data, internet, and any other services provided over wire, fiber optic, microwave, wireless, and any other transmission systems (""), for part or all of Tenant's telecommunications within the Building and from the Building to any other location.  All providers of Telecommunications Services shall be required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Building, applicable laws and Landlord's policies and practices for the Building.  Tenant acknowledges that Landlord shall not be required to provide or arrange for any Telecommunications Services and that Landlord shall have no liability to any Tenant Party in connection with the installation, operation or maintenance of Telecommunications Services or any equipment or facilities relating thereto.  Tenant, at its cost and for its own account, shall be solely responsible for obtaining all Telecommunications Services.  All connections shall be made in a manner reasonably approved by Landlord, shall be made at Tenant's expense (including, without

limitation, any hook up, access and maintenance fees related to the installation of any equipment, wires and cables in the Premises and the commencement of service therein, and the maintenance thereafter of such equipment, wires and cables) by contractors or vendors reasonably approved by Landlord, and shall be performed in a good and workmanlike manner.
 
.  Provided Tenant is not in default of any term or provision of this Lease, Landlord agrees to provide Tenant for use by the employees, agents, customers and invitees of Tenant the number of parking spaces designated on the Basic Lease Information page in the Project parking garage on an unreserved and unassigned basis for the monthly rental stated on the Basic Lease Information page.  Such monthly rental payments shall be deemed Additional Rent hereunder and shall be payable monthly in advance along with Base Rent.  Tenant shall not use more parking spaces than the number stated on the Basic Lease Information page.  Unless otherwise provided by Landlord, in its sole discretion, the parking spaces will not be separately identified.  Landlord shall have no obligation to monitor the use of the parking area.  All parking shall be subject to any and all rules and regulations adopted by Landlord in its discretion from time to time.  Only automobiles no larger than full size passenger automobiles or pick-up trucks may be parked in the Project garage.  Tenant shall not permit or allow any vehicles that belong to or are controlled by Tenant or Tenant's employees, agents, customers or invitees to be loaded, unloaded or parked in areas other than those designated by Landlord for such activities.  A failure by Tenant or any of its employees, agents, customers or invitees to comply with the foregoing provisions shall afford Landlord the right, but not the obligation, without notice, in addition to any other rights and remedies available under this Lease, to remove and to tow away the vehicles involved and to charge the cost to Tenant, which cost shall be immediately due and payable upon demand by Landlord.  Tenant may at any time elect to relinquish in writing its right to use one or more of the parking spaces to be provided hereunder in which event Tenant shall not be required to pay for any such relinquished spaces.  If Tenant relinquishes in writing or by nonpayment any of such parking rights during the Term, Tenant shall no longer have a right to the parking relinquished and may obtain future parking solely on a space-available basis.  Landlord may increase the parking spaces rental rates from time to time at any time during the Term of this Lease, upon thirty (30) days prior notice to Tenant, but in no event shall such increased amount exceed the parking rate then generally charged in the area of the Project for similar facilities.  Tenant acknowledges that the individuals to whom garage access cards are distributed pursuant to Tenant's rights hereunder will be required by Landlord or the garage operator to execute a commercially reasonable standard parking agreement acknowledging receipt of the card, providing information regarding the make, model, and license plate number of the automobile or automobiles such party may park in the garage, and acknowledging receipt of the rules and regulations pertaining to garage access and parking.  In the event Tenant shall require substantially more spaces that the stated number of parking spaces, at Tenant's written request accompanied by Tenant's commitment to reimburse Landlord for its additional costs in connection with operating a valet system, Landlord shall consider converting the parking garage to a valet system, provided that Landlord's election to convert or decline to convert to such system shall be made in Landlord's sole discretion.  Throughout the term of this Lease Landlord shall provide a shuttle service between the Building and the nearest BART station and such other public transit locations, if any, designated by Landlord, which shall be available to Tenant's employees free of charge, subject to the reasonable rules and regulations imposed by the shuttle service regarding proper identification.  The shuttle shall operate during morning and afternoon commute hours, provided that the specific hours of operation and schedule for the shuttle service shall be determined by Landlord, however Landlord shall consult with Tenant regarding the schedule of the shuttle service. The cost of operating the shuttle service shall be an Operating Cost, and Operating Cost for the Base Year shall be deemed to include the cost of a full calendar year's shuttle service at the rate initially payable therefor.
23.3
       
Parking and Shuttle Service
 
.  Landlord has been represented in this transaction by Landlord's Broker.  Tenant has been represented in this transaction by Tenant's Broker.  Upon full execution of this Lease by both parties, (i) Landlord shall pay to Landlord's Broker a fee for brokerage services rendered by it in this transaction if provided for in a separate written agreement between Landlord and Landlord's Broker, and (ii) Landlord shall pay to Tenant's Broker a fee for brokerage services rendered by it in this transaction if provided for in a separate written agreement between Landlord and Tenant's Broker.  Landlord and Tenant each represents and warrants to the other that such party has negotiated this Lease directly with the real estate Brokers named in the Basic Lease Information page and has not authorized or employed, or acted by implication to authorize or to employ, any other real estate broker or salesman to act for such party in connection with this Lease. Each party shall hold the other harmless from and indemnify and defend the other against any and all claims by any real estate broker or salesman other than the real estate Brokers named in the Basic Lease Information page for a commission, finder's fee or other compensation as a
23.4
       
Brokers
result of the inaccuracy of such party's representation above, including any costs, expenses and attorneys' fees incurred with respect such claims.
 
.  No waiver by either party of the default or breach of any term, covenant or condition of this Lease by the other party shall be deemed a waiver of any other term, covenant or condition hereof, or of any subsequent default or breach by Tenant of the same or of any other term, covenant or condition hereof.  Landlord's consent to, or approval of, any act shall not be deemed to render unnecessary the obtaining of Landlord's consent to or approval of, any subsequent or similar act by Tenant, or be construed as the basis of an estoppel to enforce the provision or provisions of this Lease requiring such consent.  Regardless of Landlord's knowledge of a default or breach at the time of accepting Rent, the acceptance of Rent by Landlord shall not be a waiver of any preceding default or breach by Tenant of any provision hereof, other than the failure of Tenant to pay the particular Rent so accepted.  Any payment given Landlord by Tenant may be accepted by Landlord on account of monies or damages due Landlord, notwithstanding any qualifying statements or conditions made by Tenant in connection therewith, which statements and/or conditions shall be of no force or effect whatsoever unless specifically agreed to in writing by Landlord at or before the time of deposit of such payment.  No payment by Tenant of a lesser amount than the amount required under this Lease shall be deemed to be other than on account of the Rent due, and Landlord may accept such payment without prejudice to Landlord's right to recover the balance due or to pursue any other remedy herein provided.
23.5
       
No Waiver
 
.  Neither this Lease nor a memorandum thereof shall be recorded without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  Tenant shall have the right to record a short form memorandum of lease in a form reasonably approved by Landlord.
23.6
       
Recording
 
.  Within ten (10) business days following Landlord's request, Tenant shall execute, acknowledge and deliver written estoppel certificates addressed to (i) any Holder or prospective mortgagee of Landlord, or (ii) any purchaser or prospective purchaser of all or any portion of, or interest in, the Project, on a commercially reasonable form specified by Landlord, certifying as to such facts (if true) and agreeing to such notice provisions and other matters as such mortgagee(s) or purchaser(s) may reasonably require, including, without limitation, the following: (a) that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or in full force and effect as modified, and stating the modifications); (b) the amount of, and date to which Rent and other charges have been paid in advance; (c) the amount of any Security Deposit; and (d) acknowledging that to Tenant's current knowledge without duty of inquiry, Landlord is not in default under this Lease (or, if Landlord is claimed to be in default, stating the nature of the alleged default).  Any such estoppel certificate may be relied upon by any such mortgagee or purchaser.  If Tenant fails to execute any such certificate complying with the above provisions within the period described above, and thereafter Tenant does not deliver such executed document within ten (10) days of written notice from Landlord of such failure, such failure shall, at Landlord's election, constitute an Event of Default hereunder and shall be conclusive upon Tenant that (1) this Lease is in full force and effect and has not been modified except as represented by Landlord; (2) not more than one month's Rent has been paid in advance; and (3) Landlord is not in default under this Lease.  At any time and from time to time, in the context of a sale of Tenant's business or a financing thereof only, and upon not less than fifteen (15) business days' prior notice from Tenant, Landlord shall execute and deliver to Tenant a statement addressed to any lender, investor or acquirer of Tenant or prospective lender, lender or acquirer of Tenant, on a commercially reasonable form specified by Tenant, certifying (i) the titles and dates of the documents then comprising the Lease, (ii) the current amounts of and the dates to which the Rent and other charges have been paid, (iii) the amount to the Security Deposit then held by Landlord, and (iii) to the best of Landlord's knowledge without duty of inquiry that Tenant is not in default under this Lease (or if Tenant is in default, specifying the nature of such default).
23.7
       
Estoppel Certificate
 
.  In the event of the transfer and assignment by Landlord of its interest in this Lease and in the Building to a party expressly assuming Landlord's obligations under this Lease, Landlord shall thereby be released from any further obligations hereunder accruing thereafter, and Tenant agrees to look solely to such successor in interest of the Landlord for performance of such obligations. Any security given by Tenant to secure performance of Tenant's obligations hereunder shall be assigned and transferred by Landlord to such successor in interest and Landlord shall thereby be discharged of any further obligation relating thereto.
23.8
       
Transfers by Landlord
 
.  In the event either party places the enforcement of this Lease, or any part of it, or the collection of any Rent due, or to become due, hereunder, or recovery of the possession of the Premises, in the
23.9
       
Attorneys' Fees
hands of an attorney, or files suit upon the same, the prevailing party shall recover its reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and expenses, including those which may be incurred on appeal.  The term shall include, without limitation, a party who substantially obtains or defeats the relief sought, as the case may be, whether by compromise, settlement, judgment or otherwise.  The attorneys' fee award shall not be computed in accordance with any court fee schedule, but shall be such as to fully reimburse all attorneys' fees reasonably incurred.
"prevailing party"
 
.  No act or conduct of Landlord, including, without limitation, the acceptance of keys to the Premises, shall constitute an acceptance of the surrender of the Premises by Tenant before the Expiration Date.

At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business
that might have been transacted at the original meeting.

STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING
 
Any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing setting forth the action so taken shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.  Such consents shall be delivered to the corporation by delivery to it registered office in the state of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded.

RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDER NOTICE; VOTING

If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.

If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten(10) percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable.

The corporation shall, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended, indemnify any person against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, or proceeding in which such person was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the corporation.  For purposes of this Section 6.1, a "director" or "officer" of the corporation shall mean any person (i) who is or was a director or officer of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was a director or officer of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.
 
The corporation shall be required to indemnify a director or officer in connection with an action, suit, or proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such director or officer only if the initiation of such action, suit, or proceeding (or part thereof) by the director or officer was authorized by the board of Directors of the corporation.
 
The corporation shall pay the expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred by a director or officer of the corporation entitled to indemnification hereunder in defending any action, suit or proceeding referred to in this Section 6.1 in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that payment of expenses incurred by a director or officer of the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the director or officer to repay all amounts advanced if it should ultimately be determined that the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 6.1 or otherwise.
 
The rights conferred on any person by this Article shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, these bylaws, agreement, vote of the stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
 
Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.

INDEMNIFICATION OF OTHERS
 
The corporation shall have the power, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended, to indemnify any person (other than directors and officers) against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, or proceeding, in which such person was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party by reason of the fact that such person is or was an employee or agent of the corporation.  For purposes of this Section 6.2, an "employee" or "agent" of the corporation (other than a director or officer) shall mean any person (i) who is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was an employee or agent of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.

INSURANCE
 
The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
 
6.4
                              
SAVINGS CLAUSE

ARTICLE VIII
GENERAL MATTERS
8.1
                              
RECORD DATE FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN NOTICE AND VOTING
 
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted and which shall not be more than sixty (60) days before any such action.  In that case, only stockholders of record at the close of business on the date so fixed are entitled to receive the dividend, distribution or allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date so fixed, except as otherwise provided by law.
 
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, then the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the applicable resolution.
 
8.2
                              
CHECKS; DRAFTS; EVIDENCES OF INDEBTEDNESS
 
From time to time, the board of directors shall determine by resolution which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness that are issued in the name of or payable to the corporation, and only the persons so authorized shall sign or endorse those instruments.
8.3
                              
FISCAL YEAR
 
The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the board of directors.
 
8.4
                              
CORPORATE CONTRACTS AND INSTRUMENTS:  HOW EXECUTED
 
The board of directors, except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, may authorize and empower any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation; such power and authority may be general or confined to specific instances.  Unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.
 
8.5
                              
STOCK CERTIFICATES; TRANSFER; PARTLY PAID SHARES
 
The shares of the corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the board of directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares.  Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation.  Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the board of directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and, upon request, every holder of uncertificated shares, shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, the chairman or vice-chairman of the board of directors, or the president or vice-president, and by the treasurer or an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant secretary of such corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form.  Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile.  In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
 
Certificates for shares shall be of such form and device as the board of directors may designate and shall state the name of the record holder of the shares represented thereby; its number; date of issuance; the number of shares for which it is issued; a summary statement or reference to the powers, designations, preferences or other special rights of such stock and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights, if any; a statement or summary of liens, if any; a conspicuous notice of restrictions upon transfer or registration of transfer, if any; a statement as to any applicable voting trust agreement; if the shares be assessable, or, if assessments are collectible by personal action, a plain statement of such facts.
 
Upon surrender to the secretary or transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.
The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor.  Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated.  Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.
 
8.6
                              
SPECIAL DESIGNATION ON CERTIFICATES
 
If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
 
8.7
                              
LOST CERTIFICATES
 
Except as provided in this Section 8.7, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and cancelled at the same time.  The board of directors may, in case any share certificate or certificate for any other security is lost, stolen or destroyed, authorize the issuance of replacement certificates on such terms and conditions as the board may require; the board may require indemnification of the corporation secured by a bond or other adequate security sufficient to protect the corporation against any claim that may be made against it, including any expense or liability, on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of the certificate or the issuance of the replacement certificate.
 
8.8
                              
TRANSFER AGENTS AND REGISTRARS
 
The board of directors may appoint one or more transfer agents or transfer clerks, and one or more registrars, each of which shall be an incorporated bank or trust company  either domestic or foreign, who shall be appointed at such times and places as the requirements of the corporation may necessitate and the board of directors may designate.
 
8.9
                              
CONSTRUCTION; DEFINITIONS
 
Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction and definitions in the General Corporation Law of Delaware shall govern the construction of these
bylaws.  Without limiting the generality of this provision, as used in these bylaws, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the term "person" includes both an entity and a natural person.
 
ARTICLE IX
AMENDMENTS
The original or other bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon the directors.  The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.
 
Whenever an amendment or new bylaw is adopted, it shall be copied in the book of bylaws with the original bylaws, in the appropriate place.  If any bylaw is repealed, the fact of repeal with the date of the meeting at which the repeal was enacted or the filing of the operative written consent(s) shall be stated in said book.

Sales Representatives, Agents, and Consultants
 
Although the majority of the business of Advent is done through the Company's own sales channel, we also use distributors and other third parties to sell our products, provide services and to act on behalf.

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 
Advent requires full compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by all of its employees, agents, contractors, consultants, distributors, and resellers.  The anti-bribery and corrupt payment provisions of the FCPA make illegal any corrupt offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization to pay any money, gift, or anything of value to any foreign official, or any foreign political party, candidate or official, for the purpose of: influencing any act or failure to act, in the official capacity of that foreign official or party; or inducing the foreign official or party to use influence to affect a decision of a foreign government or agency, in order to obtain or retain business for anyone, or direct business to anyone.

Export Controls
 
Many countries maintain controls on the destinations to which products, including software, may be exported.  The United States government maintains some of the strictest export controls.  The U.S. regulations are complex and apply both to exports from the United States and to exports from other countries, when those products contain components or technology that originated in the United States.  Software created in the United States is subject to these regulations even if duplicated and packaged abroad.  In some circumstances, presenting technical data to foreign nationals in the United States may constitute a controlled export. The Legal Department can provide you with guidance on the embargoed countries, denied parties, and other export control issues.

Non-Disclosure of Advent Confidential Information
 
Confidential information may take many forms.  An oral presentation about the Company's product development plans may contain protected trade secrets.  A customer list or employee list may be a protected trade secret.  Demonstration of
a version of new Advent software may contain information protected by trade secret and copyright laws.
 
The protection of confidential business information and trade secrets is vital to the interests and the success of Advent.  As a condition of employment, all employees are required to sign and return an employment, confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreement with their signed offer letter prior to the start of their employment with Advent.  Employees who improperly use or disclose trade secrets or confidential information will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment and legal action, even if they do not actually benefit from the disclosed information.
our
 
To further Advent's business, we may sometimes need to disclose our proprietary information to potential business partners.  However, such disclosure should never be made without carefully considering its potential benefits and risks.  If your supervisor/manager and other appropriate Advent management determine that disclosure of confidential information is necessary, you must then contact the Legal Department to ensure that an appropriate written nondisclosure agreement has been signed by all parties before any disclosure takes place.  Additionally, no financial information other than that required by statutory reporting requirements may be disclosed without the prior approval of the Chief Financial Officer.  Never accept a third party's nondisclosure agreement without reviewing it with the Legal Department.
 
Confidential information is sometimes distributed to employees from members of the executive staff.  Advent employees are not authorized to share this information externally.  Posting these communications on the Internet or e-mailing them to outside parties is prohibited.  Only designated employees may refer to this information externally or speak with the press or financial analyst community regarding confidential matters.
 
22.
      
Handling the Confidential Information of Others
 
Advent has many kinds of business relationships with many companies and individuals.  Sometimes they will volunteer confidential information about their products or business plans to induce Advent to enter into a business relationship.  At other times, Advent may request that a third party provide confidential information to evaluate a potential business relationship with that party.  Whatever the situation, we must take special care to handle the confidential information of others responsibly, as it may be a trade secret or protected intellectual property. 
You should accept only confidential information necessary to accomplish the purpose of receiving it, such as a decision on whether to proceed to negotiate a
deal.  If more detailed or extensive confidential information is offered and it is not necessary for your immediate purposes, it should be refused and any confidential information of a third party that is no longer necessary should be promptly returned to such third party or destroyed.  A non-disclosure agreement or other agreement with such party may also set forth specific return or destruction obligations
and confidential information received from a third part may be subject to contractual or other non-disclosure obligations
. 
If you have any question as to how to handle any matter related to confidential information of third parties, please contact the Legal Department.
 
23.
      
Competitive Information
 
Advent employees should not attempt to gain information about competitors by improper means.  Advent may employ former employees of competitors and others and recognizes and respects the obligations of those employees not to disclose or use confidential information of their former employers or other third parties.  It is also against Advent's policy to communicate to any competitor any confidential Advent information relating to pricing, cost, credit terms, market allocation and other proprietary information without the approval of the Chief Financial Officer or the Legal Department.
 
24.
      
Requests by Regulatory Authorities
 
Advent and its employees, agents and contractors must cooperate with appropriate government inquiries and investigations.  In this context, however, it is important to protect the legal rights of Advent with respect to its confidential information.  All government requests for information, documents or investigative interviews must be referred to Advent's External Legal Counsel or Chief Counsel; responses to requests for tax information should be directed to Advent's Manager of Tax and Vice President of Finance, and all other responses to requests from entities should be directed to Advent's Chief Financial Officer or Vice President of Human Resources.  Additionally, no "material, non-public information" may be disclosed without the prior approval of the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer.

the investors or financial analysts are to be referred to the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or Senior Director, Investor Relations.  Advent has designated its Public Relations Department as official Advent spokespeople for marketing, technical and other such information.   Communication with the press on behalf of Advent should be coordinated through the Public Relations Department in advance.
 
27.
      
Conflicts of Interest
 
Ethical conduct includes the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships.  A conflict of interest exists where the interests or benefits of one person or entity conflict with the interests or benefits of Advent.  Employees must disclose to the Company's Chief Financial Officer any material transaction or relationship that could be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest and should not enter into any such transaction or relationship without the prior approval of the Company's Chief Financial Officer.  Directors and executive officers are required to obtain the prior approval of the Board of Directors, or the appropriate committee of the Board, prior to entering into any such transaction or relationship.
 
Employees have an obligation to conduct business within guidelines that prohibit actual or potential conflicts of interest.  This policy establishes only the framework within which Advent wishes its business to operate.  The purpose of guidelines contained in Section 107 of Advent's Employee Handbook is to provide general direction so employees can seek further clarification on issues related to the subject of acceptable standards of operation.

Outside Employment
 
Employees should consider their ability to meet the standards of their positions at Advent when reviewing alternative employment situations. Outside employment that constitutes a conflict of interest is prohibited.  Employees may not receive any income or material gained from third parties for materials produced or services rendered while performing their jobs as Advent employees.
  Employees should not engage in any business outside Advent if it interferes with your performance or responsibilities to Advent. 
 
29.
      
Business Interests
 
Before investing in the business interests of customers, suppliers, developers, or competitors, you must first ensure that these investments do not compromise your responsibilities to Advent.  Many factors should be considered in determining whether a conflict situation exists, including the size and nature of the investment; your ability to influence Advent decisions; your access to the confidential information of Advent or of the other company; and the nature of the relationship between Advent and the other business.  Typically, investments of less than two percent of the total outstanding shares in companies listed on a national or international securities exchange, or quoted daily by Nasdaq or any other board, do not create a conflict.
 
30.
      
Outside Directorships
 
It is a conflict of interest to serve as a director of a company in competition with Advent.  Although you may serve as a director of an Advent supplier, customer, developer, or other business partners, our policy requires that you first obtain approval from Advent's Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer before accepting a directorship, and any remuneration you receive should be of an amount equal to your responsibilities.  Such approval may be conditioned upon the completion of specified actions.

Item 4.02 (a) Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Report
 
On March 10, 2006, Advent Software, Inc. (the "Company") determined that its previously issued financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, 2004 and 2005, June 30, 2004 and 2005, and September 30, 2004 and 2005 (the "first three quarters of 2004 and 2005") and for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004 cannot be relied on due to errors in those financial statements as described below.
 
A. Accounting for Income Taxes
 
Management presented its findings and recommendation to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Audit Committee"), which concurred with management's recommendation to: i) restate the financial statements for the first three quarters of 2004 included in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q/A and for the first three quarters of 2005 included in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and ii) adjust its previously reported results of operations for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2004 and 2005 which results were furnished on a Form 8-K on January 31, 2006. The decision to restate and adjust these financial statements was discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and was made after discovery of errors in its deferred income tax liabilities and related income tax provision accounts. Specifically, the Company did not record the benefit from the deferred tax liability associated with the amortization of the intangible assets in the books of its European subsidiaries in the calculation of the Company's effective annual tax rate for the first three quarters of 2004 and 2005. Management currently estimates that the most significant impact on net income (loss) for the first three quarters of 2004 or 2005 is in the second quarter ended June 30, 2005 in which net income will increase by approximately $0.7 million after the correction of this error. The Company's consolidated statements of operations for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 will not be impacted by the correction of these errors.

The Company's  disclosures for stock-based employee compensation expense under SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148, included in Note 1 to its previously issued financial statements contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2004 ("2004 10-K/A"), the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q/A for the first three quarters of 2004 and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the first three quarters of 2005, should not be relied upon because of errors in the  disclosure of the pro forma effects on operating results as if the Company had elected to use the fair value approach to account for all stock-based compensation plans. Management's current estimate of the error's impact on the Company's footnote disclosure of the pro forma effects on net income (loss) for fiscal years 2003 and 2004 is approximately $0.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively. This error in the footnote disclosure had no impact on the Company's consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, cash flows, comprehensive income or stockholders' equity for any period.
 
Management presented its findings and recommendation to the Audit Committee, which concurred with management's recommendation to restate the stock-based employee compensation expense disclosures for fiscal 2003 and 2004 included in Note 1 to its previously issued financial statements contained in its 2004 10-K/A and for the first three quarters of 2004 included in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q/A and for the first three quarters of 2005 included in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The decision to restate the disclosure was discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and was made after discovery of errors in the accuracy and disclosure of stock-based employee compensation expense relating to the attribution period for non-routine stock compensation arrangements, including those with non-standard vesting terms or performance vesting conditions.
 
On March 16, 2006, management determined that since the Company will be restating its previously issued financial statements as described above, that it will also correct the following errors.
 
               
C. Accounting for Leasehold Improvements
 
Management presented its findings and recommendation to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which concurred with management's recommendation to: i) restate the financial statements for the first three quarters of 2004 included in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q/A and for the first three quarters of 2005 included in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and ii) adjust its previously reported results of operations for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2004 and 2005 which results were furnished on a Form 8-K on January 31, 2006. The decision to restate and adjust these financial statements was discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and was made after discovery of errors in its accumulated depreciation and depreciation expense accounts.  Specifically, the Company did not adjust the estimated useful lives of certain leasehold improvements upon a change in the lease termination date at one of its facilities and, as a result, over-depreciated the assets and understated net income (loss). Management's current estimate of the impact on the Company's net income (loss) for fiscal year 2004, as reported in the 2004 10-K/A, and fiscal year 2005, as furnished on a Form 8-K on January 31, 2006, is less than $0.2 million in each year.
 
D. Accounting for Term License Arrangements and Related Services
 
Management presented its findings and recommendation to the Audit Committee, which concurred with management's recommendation to: i) restate the financial statements for the first three quarters of 2005 included in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and ii) adjust its previously reported results of operations for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2005 which results were furnished on a Form 8-K on January 31, 2006. The decision to restate and adjust these financial statements was discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and was made after discovery of errors in its revenues, cost of revenues and sales and marketing expense accounts. Specifically, the Company did not defer license, maintenance and professional services revenue, together with related expenses in sales and marketing, on certain term license agreements in accordance with SOP 97-2. Management's current estimate of the impact on the Company's net income (loss), as reported in its condensed consolidated statements of operations for the first three quarters of 2005, as reported in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, is less than $0.4 million for each quarter of 2005, and less than $0.4 million for fiscal 2005.
 
 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404 Assessment
 
As previously disclosed in the Company's 2004 10 K/A, management concluded that due to the existence of material weaknesses, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2004. While management has not yet completed its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, management has concluded that due to the continued existence, as evidenced by matters disclosed in paragraphs  A. and B. above, of the previously identified material weaknesses related to the Company not maintaining effective controls over  (i) the accounting for income taxes, including the determination of income taxes payable, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the related income tax provision , and (ii) the accuracy and presentation and disclosure of the Company's pro forma stock-based employee compensation expense in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company's management will conclude in its "Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting" to be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2005 (the "2005 10-K"), that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2005.
 
Also, as a result of these material weaknesses, the Company's management believes that the report of its independent registered public accounting firm will contain an adverse opinion with respect to the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Furthermore, since management is continuing to assess the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, as required under the provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, additional material weaknesses, including material weaknesses related to the matters described in paragraphs C. and D. above with respect to the accounting for leasehold improvements and term lease arrangements and related services, respectively, may be identified.
 
 
As a result of these corrections, management has recommended, and the Audit Committee has concurred with, the restatement of its unaudited financial statements for the first three quarters of 2004 and 2005, through the filing of amended Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q/A for the first three quarters of 2005. In addition, the Company will also include these corrections in the financial statements and "Supplementary Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)" section of its 2005 10-K. The Company is working diligently to complete its review of these matters and to quantify the full impact of the necessary adjustments on each of the affected periods. However, due to the additional time and effort involved in preparing its "Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting" and completing its financial statements to be included in the 2005 10-K, the Company will file a Form 12b-25 notification to extend the filing of its 2005 Form 10-K by 15 calendar days.

Expenses for the second and first quarters of 2006 included $3.5 million and $3.2 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense due to the January 1, 2006 implementation of SFAS 123(R).

Investing in Innovation:

"Going forward, we will continue to execute on our strategy to strengthen and grow our core business  delivering mission-critical software and services that drive success for the investment management community."
GUIDANCE
Advent issued the following guidance for Q3 2006:
Revenues are projected to be in the range of $44 million to $46 million. There is no change to full year guidance of $180-$185 million, as term license accounting is causing a significant deferral of revenues to future periods;
                 
Expenses, including cost of revenues, amortization of developed technology and intangibles and stock-based compensation expense, are projected to be in the range of $43.5 million to $44.5million;
                 
Diluted weighted average shares outstanding will increase by roughly 0.5 percent in the third quarter from the second quarter amount of 31.3 million shares, excluding the impact of any share repurchases.

On February 26, 2007, Terry H. Carlitz and William F. Zuendt each informed the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Advent Software, Inc. (the "Company") that they will not stand for re-election at the Company's 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Ms. Carlitz and Mr. Zuendt's decisions not to stand for reelection were reached for personal reasons and were not the result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter related to its operations, policies or practices. Both Ms. Carlitz and Mr. Zuendt will continue to serve as directors through the date of the Company's next Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which is currently scheduled to be held on May 16, 2007.
ITEM 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year
On February 26, 2007, the Board approved an amendment to section 5.3 of the bylaws to reduce the authorized number of directors from eight to six, effective as of the date of the 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
ITEM 8.01 Other Events
On February 26, 2007, the Board, upon recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board, approved the form and amount of revised equity awards automatically granted to non-employee directors. No changes were made in the cash compensation of directors.
Prior to such approval, non-employee directors were eligible to receive awards of (i) an initial one-time option grant to purchase 30,000 shares of Advent common stock upon joining the Board, which vests over four years with 25% of such shares vesting after one year of service and in equal monthly installments over the ensuing three years, and (ii) an annual option grant to purchase 12,000 shares of Advent common stock made on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders vesting in twelve equal monthly installments.
As approved, eligible non-employee directors will  now receive (i) upon joining the Board, an initial one-time grant of 21,000 shares of stock-settled stock appreciation rights ("SS-SAR"), which vest over four years with 25% of such shares vesting one year after date of grant and in equal monthly installments over the ensuing three years, and 4,500 shares of restricted stock units ("RSU"), which vest over four years with 50% of such shares vesting two years after date of grant and 50% vesting four years after the date of grant;  and (ii) annual grants of 8,400 shares of SS-SAR's and 1,800 shares of RSU's, which vest 100% one year after date of grant. A SS-SAR is the right to receive in shares of Advent common stock the appreciation in fair market value of common stock between the exercise date and the date of grant. The RSU's will convert into an equivalent number of shares of Advent common stock upon vesting. Annual grants of SS-SARs and RSUs will continue to be made on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders, commencing with the 2007 Annual Meeting.

Exhibit 99.1
Advent Software, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADVS), a leading provider of software and services to the investment management industry, announced today its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2007.
SAN FRANCISCO  April 24, 2007 
"We are very pleased to report another strong quarter for Advent, reflecting the ongoing momentum of Advent's core business," said Stephanie DiMarco, Founder and Chief Executive Officer.  "The continued demand for our industry-leading solutions has allowed us to invest in and expand our product suite, making 2007 a year of innovation as Advent builds on our leadership in the market."
RESULTS
The Company reported total net revenues of $48.0 million for the first quarter of 2007, compared with $43.7 million in the first quarter of 2006.
Total expenses for the first quarter of 2007, including cost of revenues, were $48.0 million, compared with $42.6 million in the first quarter of 2006.
Net income for the first quarter of 2007 was $439,000, compared with net income of $3.4 million for the first quarter of 2006.
Diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2007 was $0.02, which compares to diluted earnings per share of $0.11 in the first quarter of 2006.
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $43.0 million as of March 31, 2007, which compares to $55.1 million as of December 31, 2006.  Advent repurchased 837,000 shares of the Company's common stock in the first quarter, for a total cash outlay of $30.1 million.
Cash flow from operations in the first quarter of 2007 was approximately $13.8 million, compared with $9.3 million in the first quarter of 2006  an increase of 49%.
FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
  Advent signed new term contract bookings totaling $9.8 million with an average term of 3.4 years, which compares with $7.9 million and an average term of 2.5 years in the first quarter of 2006.
                 
Strong Term Contract Bookings:
 Advent saw continued demand for its products, signing 64 new customer agreements.  The Company added 15 new customers for Advent Portfolio Exchange (APX), 5 new customers for Geneva, and achieved a new milestone for Moxy, Advent's industry-leading trade order management system, reporting more than 750 total customers.
                 
Customer Momentum:
:  Advent launched Advent Revenue Center for billing and revenue management in the first quarter.  The product, which integrates with both APX and Axys, has several customers already implemented.  The Company is currently engaged in validation and beta cycles for major new releases of several key products, including APX, Geneva and Moxy, as well as its new trading compliance product.
                 
Product Investment and Innovation
:  Advent changed its revenue and cost of revenue classifications in the first quarter to better align with the term license business model.  All term license revenue is now included in a new line item "Term license, maintenance and other recurring revenue," which represents 79% of the Company's revenues.  "Perpetual license fees" are now shown separately and "Professional services and other" revenue as a line item is unchanged.
                 
Updated Revenue and Cost of Revenue Classifications
Advent issued the following guidance for the second quarter of 2007:
FINANCIAL GUIDANCE
Revenues in the second quarter are projected to be in the range of $49 million to $51  million;
                 
Expenses in the second quarter are projected to be in the range of $49 million to $50 million; included in expenses are amortization of developed technology and other intangibles, and stock-based compensation, which are projected to be approximately $4.5 million for the second quarter; and,
                 
Diluted weighted average shares outstanding will increase by roughly 0.5% per quarter from the first quarter of 2007 level of 28.8 million shares, excluding the impact of any share repurchases.

Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in his capacity as a proponent to a stockholder proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to include information with respect to a stockholder proposal in the proxy statement and form of proxy for a stockholder's meeting, stockholders must provide notice as required by the regulations promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (a). The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (a), and, if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting that any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
(b)           Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b) shall be eligible for election as directors. Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors of the corporation may be made at a meeting of stockholders by or at the direction of the board of directors or by any stockholder of the corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this paragraph (b).

Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (i) as to each person, if any, whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director: (A) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (B) the principal occupation or employment of such person, (C) the class and number of shares of the corporation that are beneficially owned by such person, (D) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nominations are to be made by the stockholder, and (E) any other information relating to such person that is required  to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for elections of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including without limitation such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement, if any, as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); and (ii) as to such stockholder giving notice, the information required to be provided pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 2.5. At the request of the board of directors, any person nominated by a stockholder for election as a director shall furnish to the secretary of the corporation that information required to be set forth in the stockholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b).  The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these bylaws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting, and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
These provisions shall not prevent the consideration and approval or disapproval at an annual meeting of reports of officers, directors and committees of the board of directors, but in connection therewith no new business shall be acted upon at any such meeting unless stated, filed and received as herein provided.  Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the contrary, no business brought

before a meeting by a stockholder shall be conducted at an annual meeting except in accordance with procedures set forth in this Section 2.5.
2.6
          MANNER OF GIVING NOTICE; AFFIDAVIT OF NOTICE
Written notice of any meeting of stockholders shall be given either (i) personally, (ii) by private courier, (iii) by first or third-class United States mail, (iv) by other written communication, or (v) by other electronic or wireless means.  Notices not personally delivered shall be sent charges prepaid and shall be addressed to the stockholder at the address of that stockholder appearing on the books of the corporation or given by the stockholder to the corporation for the purpose of notice.  Notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time when delivered personally or by courier or deposited in the mail or sent by other means of written communication or other electronic or wireless means.
An affidavit of the mailing or other means of giving any notice of any stockholders' meeting, executed by the secretary or an assistant secretary, or of any transfer agent or any other agent of the corporation giving the notice, shall be prima facie evidence of the giving of such notice.
2.7
          QUORUM
The holders of a majority in voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation.  If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either (i) the chairman of the meeting or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting in accordance with Section 2.8 of these bylaws.
When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of the laws of the State of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of the question.
If a quorum be initially present, the stockholders may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken is approved by a majority of the stockholders initially constituting the quorum.
2.8
          ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE
When a meeting is adjourned to another time and place, unless these bylaws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, thereof and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.  At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that
4
 
might have been transacted at the original meeting.  If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
2.9
          VOTING
The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of these bylaws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners, and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).
Except as may be otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder.
2.10
STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING
                       
Any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing setting forth the action so taken shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.

        RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDER NOTICE; VOTING
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting or to vote thereat, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors and which shall not be more than sixty(60) days nor less than ten (10) days before the date of any such meeting, and in such event only stockholders of record on the date so fixed are entitled to notice and to vote, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date.
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting unless the board of directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting, but the board of directors shall fix a new record date if the meeting is adjourned for more than thirty (30) days from the date set for the original meeting.

A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission, telefacsimile or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact.

If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.  If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.  The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock
6
 
ledger, the list of stockholders or the books of the corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders and of the number of shares held by each such stockholder.
2.15
        INSPECTORS OF ELECTION
Before any meeting of stockholders, the board of directors may appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment.  If no inspector of election is so appointed, then the chairman of the meeting may, and on the request of any stockholder or a stockholder's proxy shall, appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting.  The number of inspectors shall be either one (1) or three (3).  If inspectors are appointed at a meeting pursuant to the request of one (1) or more stockholders or proxies, then the holders of a majority of the voting power of shares or their proxies present at the meeting shall determine whether one (1) or three (3) inspectors are to be appointed.  If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, then the chairperson of the meeting may, and upon the request of any stockholder or a stockholder's proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy.
Such inspectors shall:
determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the number of shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the authenticity, validity, and effect of proxies;
(i)   
receive votes, ballots or consents;
(ii)  
hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote;

If the resignation of a director is effective at a future time, the board of directors may elect a successor to take office when the resignation becomes effective.
Vacancies in the board of directors may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director; however, a vacancy created by the removal of a director by the vote of the stockholders or by court order may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present (which shares voting affirmatively also constitute a majority of the required quorum).  Each director so elected shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders and until a successor has been elected and qualified.
Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws:
(i)    Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
(ii)   Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the
8
 
directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected.
If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten(10) percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable.
3.5

6.7
          AMENDMENTS
Any repeal or modification of this bylaw shall only be prospective and shall not affect the rights under this bylaw in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that is the cause of any proceeding against any agent of the corporation.

The corporation shall, either at its principal executive office or at such place or places as designated by the board of directors, keep a record of its stockholders listing their names and addresses and the number and class of shares held by each stockholder, a copy of these bylaws as amended to date, accounting books and other records of its business and properties.

The chairman of the board, if any, the chief executive officer, the president, any vice president, the chief financial officer, the secretary or any assistant secretary of this corporation, or any other person authorized by the board of directors or the president or a vice president, is authorized to vote, represent and exercise on behalf of this corporation all rights incident to any and all shares of the stock of any other corporation or corporations standing in the name of this corporation.  The authority herein granted may be exercised either by such person directly or by any other person authorized to do so by proxy or power of attorney duly executed by such person having the authority.
7.4
          CERTIFICATION AND INSPECTION OF BYLAWS
The original or a copy of these bylaws, as amended or otherwise altered to date, certified by the secretary, shall be kept at the corporation's principal executive office and shall be open to inspection by the stockholders of the corporation, at all reasonable times during office hours.
8.1
          RECORD DATE FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN NOTICE AND VOTING
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted and which shall not be more than sixty (60) days before any such action.  In that case, only stockholders of record at the close of business on the date so fixed are entitled to receive the dividend, distribution or allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date so fixed, except as otherwise provided by law.
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, then the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the applicable resolution.
8.2
          CHECKS; DRAFTS; EVIDENCES OF INDEBTEDNESS
From time to time, the board of directors shall determine by resolution which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness that are issued in the name of or payable to the corporation, and only the persons so authorized shall sign or endorse those instruments.
20
 
8.3
          FISCAL YEAR
The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the board of directors.
8.4
          CORPORATE CONTRACTS AND INSTRUMENTS:  HOW EXECUTED
The board of directors, except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, may authorize and empower any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation; such power and authority may be general or confined to specific instances.  Unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.
8.5
          STOCK CERTIFICATES; TRANSFER; PARTLY PAID SHARES
The shares of the corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the board of directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares.  Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation.  Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the board of directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and, upon request, every holder of uncertificated shares, shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, the chairman or vice-chairman of the board of directors, or the president or vice-president, and by the treasurer or an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant secretary of such corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form.  Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile.  In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
Certificates for shares shall be of such form and device as the board of directors may designate and shall state the name of the record holder of the shares represented thereby; its number; date of issuance; the number of shares for which it is issued; a summary statement or reference to the powers, designations, preferences or other special rights of such stock and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights, if any; a statement or summary of liens, if any; a conspicuous notice of restrictions upon transfer or registration of transfer, if any; a statement as to any applicable voting trust agreement; if the shares be assessable, or, if assessments are collectible by personal action, a plain statement of such facts.
Upon surrender to the secretary or transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.
21
 
The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor.  Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated.  Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.
8.6
          SPECIAL DESIGNATION ON CERTIFICATES
If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
8.7
          LOST CERTIFICATES
Except as provided in this Section 8.7, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and cancelled at the same time.  The board of directors may, in case any share certificate or certificate for any other security is lost, stolen or destroyed, authorize the issuance of replacement certificates on such terms and conditions as the board may require; the board may require indemnification of the corporation secured by a bond or other adequate security sufficient to protect the corporation against any claim that may be made against it, including any expense or liability, on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of the certificate or the issuance of the replacement certificate.
8.8
          TRANSFER AGENTS AND REGISTRARS
The board of directors may appoint one or more transfer agents or transfer clerks, and one or more registrars, each of which shall be an incorporated bank or trust company  either domestic or foreign, who shall be appointed at such times and places as the requirements of the corporation may necessitate and the board of directors may designate.
8.9
          CONSTRUCTION; DEFINITIONS
Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction and definitions in the General Corporation Law of Delaware shall govern the construction of these
22
 
bylaws.  Without limiting the generality of this provision, as used in these bylaws, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the term "person" includes both an entity and a natural person.
The original or other bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon the directors.  The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.
Whenever an amendment or new bylaw is adopted, it shall be copied in the book of bylaws with the original bylaws, in the appropriate place.  If any bylaw is repealed, the fact of repeal with the date of the meeting at which the repeal was enacted or the filing of the operative written consent(s) shall be stated in said book.

said Stephanie DiMarco, Founder and Chief Executive Officer.  "Comparing this quarter to the second quarter of 2006, the growth is exceptional: bookings are up 32% and revenues are up 18%.  Operating profitability has improved significantly as we're starting to see the leverage of the term license model flowing into our income statement.  These results demonstrate the great momentum we're seeing across our product suite as well as our focused commitment to execution, which we believe will continue to yield strong Company performance and improved financial results over the long term," added DiMarco.
"We are extremely pleased with the results achieved in the second quarter of this year,"

ITEM 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On July 25, 2007, Advent Software, Inc. (the "Company") filed a current report on Form 8-K to announce its results of operations for the second quarter ended June 30, 2007. A copy of the Company's press release entitled "Advent Reports Revenue of $52.4 Million in Second Quarter, 18% Growth Over Prior Year" dated July 25, 2007 (the "Press Release") and an investor slide presentation entitled "Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Highlights" dated July 25, 2007 (the "Slide Presentation") was furnished to the Securities Exchange Commission as Exhibit 99.1 of that Form 8-K.
 
This amended current report on Form 8-K/A is being furnished to correct two errors on slide 11 of the Slide Presentation, as follows:
 
Fiscal Year 2007 revenue guidance should be in the range of $206 million to $211 million as reported in the Press Release instead of the range of $206 million to $210 million presented in the Slide Presentation.
 
In addition, Fiscal Year 2007 expense guidance was inadvertently included in the Slide Presentation.  Management currently estimates that Fiscal Year 2007 expenses should be in the range of $202 million to $205 million instead of the range of $204 million to $208 million presented in the Slide Presentation. The revenue and expense guidance for Fiscal Year 2007 is subject in all respects to the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements on page 2 of the Slide Presentation.
 
In all other respects, the information contained in the Press Release and Slide Presentation furnished on Form 8-K on July 25, 2007 remains unchanged from the original filing.
 
A copy of the Press Release and revised Slide Presentation are attached as Exhibit 99.1 and are incorporated herein by reference.

All notices of meetings of stockholders shall be sent or otherwise given in accordance with Sections 2.5 and 2.6 of these bylaws not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting.  The notice shall specify the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting and (i) in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called (no business other than that specified in the notice may be transacted) or (ii) in the case of the annual meeting, those matters which the board of directors, at the time of giving the notice, intends to present for action by the stockholders (but any proper matter may be presented at the meeting for such action).  The notice of any meeting at which directors are to be elected shall include the name of any nominee or nominees who, at the time of the notice, the board intends to present for election.
2.5
                              
ADVANCE NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDER NOMINEES AND STOCKHOLDER BUSINESS
(a)           At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting.  To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be: (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the board of directors, (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors, or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than one hundred twenty (120) calendar days before the one year anniversary of the date on which the corporation first mailed its proxy statement to stockholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders.  A stockholder's notice to the secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting: (A) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (B) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation's books, of the stockholder proposing such business, (C) the class and number of shares of the corporation that are beneficially owned by the stockholder, (D) any material interest of the stockholder in such business, and (E) any other information that is required to be provided by the stockholder pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in his capacity as a proponent to a stockholder proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to include information with respect to a stockholder proposal in the proxy statement and form of proxy for a stockholder's meeting, stockholders must provide notice as required by the regulations promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (a). The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (a), and, if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting that any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
(b)           Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b) shall be eligible for election as directors. Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors of the corporation may be made at a meeting of stockholders by or at the direction of the board of directors or by any stockholder of the corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this paragraph (b). Such nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the board of directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the secretary of the corporation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Section 2.5. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (i) as to each person, if any, whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director: (A) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (B) the principal occupation or employment of such person, (C) the class and number of shares of the corporation that are beneficially owned by such person, (D) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nominations are to be made by the stockholder, and (E) any other information relating to such person that is required  to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for elections of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including without limitation such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement, if any, as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); and (ii) as to such stockholder giving notice, the information required to be provided pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 2.5. At the request of the board of directors, any person nominated by a stockholder for election as a director shall furnish to the secretary of the corporation that information required to be set forth in the stockholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b).  The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these bylaws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting, and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
These provisions shall not prevent the consideration and approval or disapproval at an annual meeting of reports of officers, directors and committees of the board of directors, but in connection therewith no new business shall be acted upon at any such meeting unless stated, filed and received as herein provided.  Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the contrary, no business brought
before a meeting by a stockholder shall be conducted at an annual meeting except in accordance with procedures set forth in this Section 2.5.
2.6         
MANNER OF GIVING NOTICE; AFFIDAVIT OF NOTICE
Written notice of any meeting of stockholders shall be given either (i) personally, (ii) by private courier, (iii) by first or third-class United States mail, (iv) by other written communication, or (v) by other electronic or wireless means.  Notices not personally delivered shall be sent charges prepaid and shall be addressed to the stockholder at the address of that stockholder appearing on the books of the corporation or given by the stockholder to the corporation for the purpose of notice.  Notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time when delivered personally or by courier or deposited in the mail or sent by other means of written communication or other electronic or wireless means.
An affidavit of the mailing or other means of giving any notice of any stockholders' meeting, executed by the secretary or an assistant secretary, or of any transfer agent or any other agent of the corporation giving the notice, shall be prima facie evidence of the giving of such notice.
2.7         
QUORUM
The holders of a majority in voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation.  If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either (i) the chairman of the meeting or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting in accordance with Section 2.8 of these bylaws.
When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of the laws of the State of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of the question.
If a quorum be initially present, the stockholders may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken is approved by a majority of the stockholders initially constituting the quorum.
2.8         
ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE
When a meeting is adjourned to another time and place, unless these bylaws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, thereof and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.  At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business
that might have been transacted at the original meeting.  If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
2.9         
VOTING
The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of these bylaws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners, and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).
Except as may be otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder.
2.10
                       
STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING
Any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing setting forth the action so taken shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.  Such consents shall be delivered to the corporation by delivery to it registered office in the state of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded.  Delivery made to a corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.
2.11       
RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDER NOTICE; VOTING
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting or to vote thereat, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors and which shall not be more than sixty(60) days nor less than ten (10) days before the date of any such meeting, and in such event only stockholders of record on the date so fixed are entitled to notice and to vote, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date.
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting unless the board of directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting, but the board of directors shall fix a new record date if the meeting is adjourned for more than thirty (30) days from the date set for the original meeting.
The record date for any other purpose shall be as provided in Section 8.1 of these bylaws.
2.12       
PROXIES
Every person entitled to vote for directors, or on any other matter, shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents authorized by a written proxy signed by the person and filed with the secretary of the corporation, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.  A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission, telefacsimile or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact.  The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
2.13       
ORGANIZATION
The chairman of the board, or in the absence of the chairman, the president, shall call the meeting of the stockholders to order, and shall act as chairman of the meeting.  In the absence of the chairman of the board, the president, and all of the vice presidents, the stockholders shall appoint a chairman for such meeting.  The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedures at the meeting, including such matters as the regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of business.  The secretary of the corporation shall act as secretary of all meetings of the stockholders, but in the absence of the secretary at any meeting of the stockholders, the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.
2.14       
LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE
The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.  The corporation shall not be required to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list.  Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting:  (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the corporation's principal executive office.  In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation.  If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.  If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.  The stock
 
ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list of stockholders or the books of the corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders and of the number of shares held by each such stockholder.
 
2.15       
INSPECTORS OF ELECTION
 
Before any meeting of stockholders, the board of directors may appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment.  If no inspector of election is so appointed, then the chairman of the meeting may, and on the request of any stockholder or a stockholder's proxy shall, appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting.  The number of inspectors shall be either one (1) or three (3).  If inspectors are appointed at a meeting pursuant to the request of one (1) or more stockholders or proxies, then the holders of a majority of the voting power of shares or their proxies present at the meeting shall determine whether one (1) or three (3) inspectors are to be appointed.  If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, then the chairperson of the meeting may, and upon the request of any stockholder or a stockholder's proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy.
 
Such inspectors shall:
 
(i)   
determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the number of shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the authenticity, validity, and effect of proxies;
 
(ii)  
receive votes, ballots or consents;
 
(iii) 
hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote;
 
(iv) 
count and tabulate all votes or consents;
 
(v)  
determine when the polls shall close;
 
(vi) 
determine the result; and
 
(

managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the board of directors.
 
3.2

Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders to hold office until the next annual meeting.

RESIGNATION AND VACANCIES
 
Any director may resign effective on giving notice in writing or by electronic transmission to the chairman of the board, the president, the secretary or the board of directors, unless the notice specifies a later time for that resignation to become effective.  If the resignation of a director is effective at a future time, the board of directors may elect a successor to take office when the resignation becomes effective.
 
Vacancies in the board of directors may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director; however, a vacancy created by the removal of a director by the vote of the stockholders or by court order may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present (which shares voting affirmatively also constitute a majority of the required quorum).  Each director so elected shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders and until a successor has been elected and qualified.
 
Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws:
 
(i)    Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
 
(ii)   Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the
 
directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected.
 
If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
 
If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten(10) percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable.
 
3.5         
REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS
 
Unless otherwise restricted by statute, by the certificate of incorporation or by these bylaws, any director or the entire board of directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.

The first meeting of each newly elected board of directors shall be held at such time and place as shall be fixed by the vote of the stockholders at the annual meeting.  In the event of the failure of the stockholders to fix the time or place of such first meeting of the newly elected board of directors, or in the event such meeting is not held at the time and place so fixed by the stockholders,
 
the meeting may be held at such time and place as shall be specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for special meetings of the board of directors, or as shall be specified in a written waiver signed by all of the directors.
 
3.8         
REGULAR MEETINGS

ARTICLE VI INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND OTHER AGENTS
6.1         
INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS
The corporation shall, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended, indemnify any person against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, or proceeding in which such person was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the corporation.  For purposes of this Section 6.1, a "director" or "officer" of the corporation shall mean any person (i) who is or was a director or officer of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was a director or officer of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.
The corporation shall be required to indemnify a director or officer in connection with an action, suit, or proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such director or officer only if the initiation of such action, suit, or proceeding (or part thereof) by the director or officer was authorized by the board of Directors of the corporation.
The corporation shall pay the expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred by a director or officer of the corporation entitled to indemnification hereunder in defending any action, suit or proceeding referred to in this Section 6.1 in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that payment of expenses incurred by a director or officer of the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the director or officer to repay all amounts advanced if it should ultimately be determined that the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 6.1 or otherwise.
The rights conferred on any person by this Article shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, these bylaws, agreement, vote of the stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.
6.2         
INDEMNIFICATION OF OTHERS
The corporation shall have the power, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended, to indemnify any person (other than directors and officers) against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, or proceeding, in which such person was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party by reason of the fact that such person is or was an employee or agent of the corporation.  For purposes of this Section 6.2, an "employee" or "agent" of the corporation (other than a director or officer) shall mean any person (i) who is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was an employee or agent of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.

6.4         
SAVINGS CLAUSE
If this Article VI or any portion thereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation against expenses (including attorney's fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, and whether internal or external, including a grand jury proceeding and an action or suit brought by or in the right of the corporation, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law.
6.5
                              
CONTINUATION OF INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VI shall, unless otherwise prided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
6.6         
NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS
The rights conferred on any person by this bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office.

6.7         
AMENDMENTS

ARTICLE VII RECORDS AND REPORTS
7.1         
MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS

Any stockholder of record, in person or by attorney or other agent, shall, upon written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof, have the right during the usual hours for business to inspect for any proper purpose the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and records and to make copies or extracts therefrom.  A proper purpose shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a stockholder.  In every instance where an attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the right to inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act on behalf of the stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the corporation at its registered office in Delaware or at its principal place of business.
7.2         
INSPECTION BY DIRECTORS
Any director shall have the right to examine the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders and its other books and records for a purpose reasonably related to his or her position as a director.

REPRESENTATION OF SHARES OF OTHER CORPORATIONS
The chairman of the board, if any, the chief executive officer, the president, any vice president, the chief financial officer, the secretary or any assistant secretary of this corporation, or any other person authorized by the board of directors or the president or a vice president, is authorized to vote, represent and exercise on behalf of this corporation all rights incident to any and all shares of the stock of any other corporation or corporations standing in the name of this corporation.

7.4         
CERTIFICATION AND INSPECTION OF BYLAWS
The original or a copy of these bylaws, as amended or otherwise altered to date, certified by the secretary, shall be kept at the corporation's principal executive office and shall be open to inspection by the stockholders of the corporation, at all reasonable times during office hours.
ARTICLE VIII GENERAL MATTERS
8.1         
RECORD DATE FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN NOTICE AND VOTING
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted and which shall not be more than sixty (60) days before any such action.  In that case, only stockholders of record at the close of business on the date so fixed are entitled to receive the dividend, distribution or allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date so fixed, except as otherwise provided by law.
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, then the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the applicable resolution.
8.2         
CHECKS; DRAFTS; EVIDENCES OF INDEBTEDNESS
From time to time, the board of directors shall determine by resolution which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness that are issued in the name of or payable to the corporation, and only the persons so authorized shall sign or endorse those instruments.
8.3         
FISCAL YEAR
The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the board of directors.
8.4         
CORPORATE CONTRACTS AND INSTRUMENTS:  HOW EXECUTED
The board of directors, except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, may authorize and empower any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation; such power and authority may be general or confined to specific instances.  Unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.
8.5         
STOCK CERTIFICATES; TRANSFER; PARTLY PAID SHARES
The shares of the corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the board of directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares.  Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation.  Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the board of directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and, upon request, every holder of uncertificated shares, shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, the chairman or vice-chairman of the board of directors, or the president or vice-president, and by the treasurer or an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant secretary of such corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form.  Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile.  In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
Certificates for shares shall be of such form and device as the board of directors may designate and shall state the name of the record holder of the shares represented thereby; its number; date of issuance; the number of shares for which it is issued; a summary statement or reference to the powers, designations, preferences or other special rights of such stock and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights, if any; a statement or summary of liens, if any; a conspicuous notice of restrictions upon transfer or registration of transfer, if any; a statement as to any applicable voting trust agreement; if the shares be assessable, or, if assessments are collectible by personal action, a plain statement of such facts.
Upon surrender to the secretary or transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.
The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor.  Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated.  Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.
8.6         
SPECIAL DESIGNATION ON CERTIFICATES
If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
8.7         
LOST CERTIFICATES
Except as provided in this Section 8.7, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and cancelled at the same time.  The board of directors may, in case any share certificate or certificate for any other security is lost, stolen or destroyed, authorize the issuance of replacement certificates on such terms and conditions as the board may require; the board may require indemnification of the corporation secured by a bond or other adequate security sufficient to protect the corporation against any claim that may be made against it, including any expense or liability, on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of the certificate or the issuance of the replacement certificate.
8.8         
TRANSFER AGENTS AND REGISTRARS
The board of directors may appoint one or more transfer agents or transfer clerks, and one or more registrars, each of which shall be an incorporated bank or trust company  either domestic or foreign, who shall be appointed at such times and places as the requirements of the corporation may necessitate and the board of directors may designate.
8.9         
CONSTRUCTION; DEFINITIONS
Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction and definitions in the General Corporation Law of Delaware shall govern the construction of these
bylaws.  Without limiting the generality of this provision, as used in these bylaws, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the term "person" includes both an entity and a natural person.
ARTICLE IX AMENDMENTS
The original or other bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon the directors.  The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.
Whenever an amendment or new bylaw is adopted, it shall be copied in the book of bylaws with the original bylaws, in the appropriate place.  If any bylaw is repealed, the fact of repeal with the date of the meeting at which the repeal was enacted or the filing of the operative written consent(s) shall be stated in said book.

FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
 
                 
Benefit of Term Licensing Model:
  For the first time in the company's history, total revenue grew from the fourth quarter to the first quarter by $2.1 million, a 3% increase.  The success of the transition to term licensing, which Advent started nearly four years ago, has reduced the impact of natural seasonality on revenue.  The recurring component of revenue was 80% in the first quarter.
 
                 
Term Contract Value Growth
:  Advent's term contract value, including Advent Portfolio Exchange (APX) migrations, was $15.7 million, which represents 41% growth over the same period last year.  With an average term of 2.8 years, the contracts signed in the first quarter will add approximately $5.5 million in annual revenue, an increase of 64% over the same period last year, once they are fully implemented.
 
                 
Product Investment and Innovation
:  On a GAAP basis, Advent invested 21% of revenue in product development. 
Highlighting Advent's role as an innovator in the industry, Advent was named "Leading Provider of Fund Accounting and Reporting Systems" by , based on the strength of Geneva's reputation, which is strengthened each year by additional product development.  The award recognizes the leading service providers for the European hedge fund industry.
The Hedge Fund Journal

The Company reported record revenue of $64.0 million for the second quarter of 2008, compared to $52.4 million in the second quarter of 2007, a 22% increase.
 
Income from operations for the second quarter of 2008 was $5.1 million, or 8% of revenue, which represented an increase of 67% compared with $3.0 million, or 6% of revenue, in the second quarter of 2007.
 
Net income for the second quarter of 2008 was $7.4 million compared to net income of $5.1 million in the second quarter of 2007, a 44% increase.
 
On a fully diluted basis, earnings per share in the second quarter of 2008 were $0.26 and represent a 43% increase from diluted earnings per share of $0.18 in the second quarter of 2007.

SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
 
                 
Operating Cash Flow:
  Advent's operating cash flow was $25.8 million for the second quarter of 2008.  The four quarter trailing growth rate was 40%.  Days sales outstanding (DSO) were 59 days in the second quarter of 2008 versus 67 days during the same period last year.
 
                 
TIAA-CREF:
 
Advent was selected by TIAA-CREF, the leading provider of retirement services in the academic, medical and cultural fields, to build an innovative service to address new regulatory challenges faced by 403(b) retirement plan administrators.  The service will leverage Advent's custodial data infrastructure (ACD) to aggregate data from multiple vendors to help prevent non-compliant transactions before they occur and enable plan providers to verify compliance.
 
                 
Term License Growth
:  Advent's term license contract value (TCV), including migrations, was $21.2 million for the second quarter of 2008.  With an average term of 3.1 years, the corresponding annual contract value (ACV) was approximately $6.9 million, an increase of 9% over the same period last year.  When fully implemented, the term license contracts signed in the second quarter will add an additional $6.9 million to annual term license revenue.  The four quarter trailing growth rates for TCV and ACV were 55% and 47%, respectively.
 It should be noted the TIAA-CREF contract is for data services, rather than a term license, and as such is not included in term license contract value, however, after meeting certain milestones and acceptance, the expected total value of that contract exceeds the term license contract value reported for the second quarter of 2008.
 
                 
Customer Momentum for APX and
Geneva
:  Advent saw continued momentum in customer wins for its award-winning portfolio accounting platforms.  The Company sold a second quarter record of 25 Advent Portfolio Exchange ("APX") contracts, bringing the total number of APX contracts sold to 237 worldwide
.  Advent also sold 12 new Geneva contracts, bringing the total number of Geneva contracts sold to 176 worldwide.
 
Advent has also announced that its Chief Financial Officer, Craig Collins, has left the Company.  Mr. Collins will spend more time with family and pursue other opportunities.  Mr. Collins has made himself available as required to help in any transition. In the interim, Chief Executive Officer Stephanie DiMarco will be responsible for the operations of Advent's finance department.  Jim Cox, Advent's Vice President and Corporate Controller, has been named Advent's Principal Accounting Officer.
 
FINANCIAL GUIDANCE
 
All 2008 guidance figures shown in the table below represent increases from previous guidance.
 
 
                 
The effective tax rate for the full year 2008 remains in the range of 30% to 35%, assuming the R&D tax credit is not renewed by Congress and 35% is used for the Company's calculations of non-GAAP diluted EPS.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
Advent to Acquire Leading Research Management Solution (RMS) Provider Tamale Software
 
                 
Acquisition Further Extends Advent's Footprint in the Front Office and Will Establish the Company as a Leader in the Rapidly Growing RMS Market
                 
Combination Will Create a Powerful Information Hub That Bridges Front-Office Research and Back-Office Information to Optimize the Investment Decision Process
 
SAN FRANCISCO and NEW YORK
 Advent Software, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADVS), a leading provider of software and services for the investment management industry, and Tamale Software, Inc., a leader in research management solutions (RMS), today announced the signing of a definitive agreement under which Advent will acquire privately held Tamale Software.
September 4, 2008 
 
"We're thrilled to have Tamale's innovative technology and proven team on board as we enter the nascent and fast-growing RMS market," said Advent's Founder and CEO Stephanie DiMarco.  "We chose Tamale Software because, as the clear industry leader and a pioneer in the field of RMS, they bring unparalleled vision and a track record of success as we extend Advent's footprint in the front office with this powerful, game-changing productivity tool for our clients' investment teams."
 
The Tamale Solution
 
In recent years, the investment community has struggled to effectively manage and leverage across their organizations a massive influx of investment information (sell-side research, email, independently produced analysis, news, and internet content) in an increasingly complex compliance environment.
 
Tamale Software solves this problem with Tamale RMS, the firm's innovative workflow software solution that creates a centralized information hub to easily manage and access research information, enhancing collaboration across the investment team and optimizing the investment decision-making process.
 
Since pioneering the RMS space in 2004, Tamale Software has become a clear leader, with more than 1,700 investment professionals at hedge funds, endowments, funds of funds, private equity firms and traditional asset management firms using Tamale RMS to manage their workflow and research process.  Tamale's intuitive, easy-to-use and extensible RMS platform was named the best front-office innovation of 2007 by magazine, and Tamale Software was named to magazine's 2007 list of 21 companies shaping the 21st century.

A Powerful Combination
 
"Becoming part of the Advent team gives Tamale a tremendous opportunity to expand our global reach and bring the benefits of RMS to a much wider audience," said Tamale's President
 
and CEO, Mark Rice.  "We are excited to be joining forces with a proven leader that shares our commitment to innovation and driving success for our clients."
 
"Tamale RMS complements Advent's product offerings, and the integrated solution will bridge research management and portfolio management to increase efficiency and link analysts' recommendations to investment performance," continued Advent's DiMarco.  "We are tremendously excited to work with Tamale Software to continue to deliver on the promise of automating mission-critical business processes for our investment management clients."
 
The Tamale management team and its employees, based primarily in New York, Boston and the UK, will join Advent, and will continue to develop, service and sell the Tamale solution.
 
Terms of Agreement
 
Under the terms of the agreement, Advent will pay approximately $70 million for all of the outstanding capital stock of Tamale, with 60 percent of the consideration payable in shares of Advent's common stock and the remaining 40 percent in cash.  Advent will issue approximately 900,000 shares based on the average closing price of $46.44 for the 15 trading days prior to the signing date, in addition to approximately $28 million in cash consideration, subject to adjustment for third-party expenses and certain other specified items.  No options will be assumed by Advent in connection with this transaction.  The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2008.
 
Tamale is a subscription-based business.  Based on Tamale's 2008 customer acquisition and run rate, Advent estimates 2009 revenue from Tamale to be in the range of $17 to $20 million.  In addition, Advent expects the transaction to be neutral to earnings per share (EPS) in 2009 on a non-GAAP basis and dilutive to EPS on a GAAP basis, which will include stock-based compensation and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.
 
GCA Savvian Advisors, LLC acted as exclusive financial advisor to Tamale on this transaction.
 
Stock Repurchase Program
 
Advent also announced that the Company will be entering into a pre-arranged Rule 10b5-1 trading plan with a broker to facilitate the repurchase of its shares of common stock, pursuant to the requirements of and in conformity with the provisions of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Under the trading plan, Advent may repurchase shares without suspension for trading blackout periods.  The shares to be repurchased under the trading plan will be part of the stock repurchase program approved in May 2008 to repurchase up to 1.0 million shares under Rule 10b-18. The 10b5-1 trading plan will commence on October 1, 2008 and purchases will be made by a broker and based upon the guidelines and parameters of the 10b5-1 plan.
 
Analyst and Investor Event
 
Additional information will be available during Advent's annual Analyst and Investor Event on Sunday, September 7, 2008 at 3:00 pm PDT.  Analysts, investors and media may access the event by visiting the live webcast available at http://investor.advent.com.

Consolidated Financial Statements
 
Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006
 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Tamale Software, Inc.
Boston, Massachusetts
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tamale Software, Inc. and Subsidiary (the "Company") as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended. The consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tamale Software, Inc. and Subsidiary as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1, certain conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plan in regard to these matters is also described in Note 1. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NATURE OF BUSINESS
 
Tamale Software, Inc. and Subsidiary ("Tamale" or "the Company") consists of Tamale Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation and its subsidiary, Tamale Software UK, Ltd. The Company provides stand-alone and client/server software products, that allow investment professionals to store, organize and retrieve pertinent research across the entire enterprise.
 
The Company is subject to risks common to technology companies including, but not limited to, dependence on key personnel, the need to obtain financing to fund operations, rapid technological change, competition from other products and larger companies, and the need for successful development and marketing of their products and services. The Company has incurred significant operating losses since inception. To date, the Company has been funded principally by venture capital financings. The Company's ultimate success is dependent upon the ability to raise additional capital and to successfully commercialize and market its products.
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred net losses and negative operating cash flows since inception, has continued to incur losses and negative operating cash flows subsequent to December 31, 2007, and expects to incur additional losses and negative operating cash flows in the near future in excess of currently available capital. These factors give rise to substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.
 
The ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the Company's ability to raise additional capital sufficient to cover operating costs, meet its obligations on a timely basis, and ultimately obtain profitable operations. Management plans to obtain the necessary capital through the issuance of debt or equity to continue to operate as a going concern.

Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States necessarily requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives of property and equipment, accrued liabilities, and the deferred tax valuation allowance. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.  Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds at December 31, 2007 and 2006.
 
Accounts Receivable
 
Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances.  An allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for those accounts receivable considered to be uncollectible based upon historical experience and management's evaluation of outstanding accounts receivable at the end of the year.  Bad debts are written off against the allowance when identified.  The allowance for doubtful accounts was $0 and $30,000 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
 
Inventory
 
Inventory, consisting of material, is stated at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is computed on a first-in, first-out basis.  As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, no reserve for excess or obsolete inventory was considered necessary.
 
Property and Equipment
 
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Long-Lived Assets
 
The Company accounts for its intangible assets in accordance with SFAS No. 144, This statement requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.The Company's intangible assets are comprised of various patents/trade names (Note 3). These assets are amortized ratably over their expected useful life of seven years and are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment exist. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company has not identified any impairment of its long-lived assets.

Revenue Recognition
 
The Company provides term licenses for the use of its software, along with certain training, support, installation and hardware in multiple element arrangements. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for software licenses and related elements in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition.
 
Most of the Company's revenue is derived from multiple element arrangements that include a term license (generally one year), maintenance, services, hardware, and training. The Company recognizes revenue on such arrangements, ratably over the terms of the initial contractual maintenance period, generally one year, as pursuant to SOP No. 97-2, the Company cannot establish vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) for the maintenance services when they are bundled with term licenses of 12 months or less. The Company has not established VSOE for its training services or hardware.
 
In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 104, revenue is considered to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; product has been shipped or delivered; the price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. If customer acceptance clauses exist, revenue is deferred until customer acceptance.
Revenue Recognition,
 
The Company also generates revenue from consulting arrangements that are entered into separately from the multiple element arrangements. Revenue from the consulting arrangements is recorded on a proportional performance basis, generally using labor hours.
 
Deferred revenue represents amounts received from customers under software licenses, maintenance agreements, or for product sales in advance of achievement of the aforementioned revenue recognition criteria.

Deferred Costs
 
The Company's product incorporates technology in the form of hardware purchased from a third-party vendor. Hardware purchased from vendors is reported as deferred costs and amortized to cost of revenue using the straight-line method over the term over which the related revenue is recognized, which is generally one year. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, such deferred costs totaled $126,834 and $98,704, respectively, and are included in deferred costs in the accompanying balance sheets.
 
Software Development Costs
 
The Company evaluates whether to capitalize or expense software development costs in accordance with SFAS No. 86, The Company sells products in a market that is subject to rapid technological change, new product development, and changing customer needs. Consequently, the Company has determined that technological feasibility is not established until the development stage of the product is nearly complete. The Company defines technological feasibility as the completion of a working model. The time period during which costs are to be capitalized, from the point of reaching technological feasibility until the time of general product release, is very limited and, consequently, amounts capitalizable are not material to the Company's financial position or results of operations. Therefore, the Company has charged all such costs to research and development in the period incurred.
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed.
 
Income Taxes
 
The Company follows SFAS No. 109, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax effects of events that have been included in financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. SFAS No. 109 also requires the establishment of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if, based upon weighted available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
Accounting for Income Taxes,
 
Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers
 
Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.  The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in bank deposit accounts, which at times may exceed federally insured limits.  The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.  The Company provides credit to customers in the normal course of business.  Collateral is not required for accounts receivable.  The Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers, and consequently believes that its accounts receivable credit exposure is limited.

Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers...continued
 
For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company did not have any customers that comprised more than 10% of revenues. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, there were no customer balances that exceeded 10% of net accounts receivable.
 
Stock-Based Compensation
 
SFAS No. 123(R), , requires nonpublic companies that used the minimum value method in SFAS No. 123, , for either recognition or pro forma disclosures to apply SFAS No. 123(R) using the prospective-transition method. As such, the Company will continue to apply Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, , in future periods to equity awards outstanding at the date of SFAS No. 123(R)'s adoption that were measured using the minimum value method.
Share-Based Payment
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
 
Effective with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company has elected to use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the weighted-average fair value of options granted. In accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), the Company will recognize the compensation cost of share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award.
 
The determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards utilizing the Black-Scholes model is affected by the stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends.  The Company does not have a history of market prices of the common stock as it is not a public company, and as such volatility is estimated in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 ("SAB No. 107") using historical volatilities of similar public entities.  The expected life of the awards is estimated based on the simplified method, as defined in SAB No. 107.  The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our awards.  The dividend yield assumption is based on history and expectation of paying no dividends.  Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.  Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
 
The fair value of stock options is measures with the following weighted average assumptions:

As of December 31, 2007, there was $688,758 of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.54 years.
 
Advertising Costs
 
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was approximately $46,784 and $21,950, respectively, for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 
In June 2006, The FASB published FASB Interpretation No. 48, ("FIN No. 48"). This interpretation seeks to reduce the significant diversity in practice associated with recognition and measurement in the accounting for income taxes. It applies to all tax positions accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109, . FIN No. 48 requires that a tax position meet "a more likely than not" threshold for the benefit of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. This threshold is to be met assuming that the tax authorities will examine the uncertain tax position. FIN No. 48 contains guidance with respect to the measurement of the benefit that is recognized for an uncertain tax position, when that benefit should be derecognized, and other matters. The Company is required to adopt the FIN No. 48 during the year ended December 31, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact of FIN No. 48 on its financial statements, and accordingly, has not determined the impact of adopting FIN No. 48.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 157 (SFAS No. 157), .  SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  SFAS No. 157 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  SFAS No. 157 will be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially adopted.
Fair Value Measurements
In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS No. 157-2, which defers the effective date of SFAS 157 for one year for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis.
Management has not yet determined the effect, if any, on the Company's financial statements taken as a whole.
 
On February 15, 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, (SFAS No. 159), which permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective of SFAS No. 159 is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Management is currently evaluating the effect that SFAS No. 159 may have on the Company's financial statements taken as a whole.
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 
 
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), (SFAS No.141(R)).  SFAS No.141(R) expands the definition of a business combination and requires the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, including the issuance of equity securities, to be determined on the acquisition date.  SFAS No. 141(R) also requires that all assets, liabilities, contingent considerations, and contingencies of an acquired business be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. In addition, SFAS No.141(R) requires that acquisition costs generally be expensed as incurred, restructuring costs generally be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date, and changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period impact income tax expense.  SFAS No.141(R) is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009, with early adoption prohibited. 
Business Combinations
The Company believes that this new pronouncement will have an impact on the accounting for future business combinations once adopted, but the effect is dependent upon the acquisitions that are made in the future.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, (SFAS No. 160).  SFAS No. 160 requires a company to clearly identify and present ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the company in the consolidated financial statements within the equity section but separate from the company's equity.  It also requires the amount of consolidated net income (loss) attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of operations; changes in ownership interest be accounted for similarly, as equity transactions; and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary and the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary be measured at fair value. This statement is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009, with early adoption prohibited.  As of December 31, 2007, the Company does not believe that the implementation of SFAS No. 160 will have, if any, on the consolidated financial statements.
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statementsan amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51
 
In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, "" (SFAS No. 161).  SFAS No. 161 enhances the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities.  Entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133, , and its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows.  This Statement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after November 15, 2008.  This Statement encourages, but does not require, comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption.  Early adoption is encouraged.  As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company does not have any derivative instruments and as such, believes there will be no future impact on the financial statements under SFAS No. 161.

INCOME TAXES
 
Temporary differences that give rise to significant deferred tax assets at December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows:
 
 
SFAS No. 109 requires a valuation allowance to be recorded if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset may not be realized. The Company's valuation allowance increased by approximately $1,432,000 and $485,000 during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
 
As of December 31, 2007, the Company has available net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $8,117,000, available to reduce federal and state taxable income.  The federal carryforwards expire in varying amounts through 2027 and the state carryforwards expire through 2012. The carryforwards may potentially be adjusted by the Internal Revenue Service. As of December 31, 2007, the Company has available net operating loss carryforwards for foreign income tax purposes of approximately $334,000.  Certain member losses of the consolidated group may be limited to the separate income of those members.
 
Under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, certain substantial changes in the Company's ownership may result in a limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards, which can be used in future years.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
 
On July 18, 2008, the Company has entered into a Letter of Intent (LOI) to be acquired by a third-party. The LOI is subject to an agreed-upon final purchase price, financing, and customary due diligence. Additionally, the Company signed a promissory note with the same third-party for $1,000,000. Interest on the promissory note accrues at 4.09% and is due on the maturity date. The maturity date of the promissory note is dependent upon certain factors, as defined in the agreement.

Notes to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
 
 
During the six months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, interest and taxes paid have not been material.
 
Note 1Basis of Presentation
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tamale Software, Inc. ("Tamale" or the "Company") and its wholly owned subsidiary. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.
 
Tamale has prepared these unaudited consolidated financial statements in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") applicable to interim financial information. Certain information and footnote disclosures included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been omitted in these interim statements pursuant to such SEC rules and regulations. These interim financial statements are prepared on the same basis and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes included in Tamale's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year, and no representation is made thereto.
 
These consolidated financial statements include all adjustments necessary to state fairly the financial position and results of operations for each interim period shown. All such adjustments occur in the ordinary course of business and are of a normal, recurring nature.
 
Note 2Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 
With the exception of those discussed below, there have been no recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements during the six months ended June 30, 2008, as compared to the recent accounting pronouncements described in Tamale's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, that are of significance or potential significance, to the Company.
 
In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS 162, "The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles" ("SFAS 162"). SFAS 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. This statement is effective 60 days following the SEC's approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, "The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles." The Company does not expect SFAS 162 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
 
Note 3Stock-Based Compensation
 
SFAS 123(R), Share-Based Payment, requires nonpublic companies that used the minimum value method in SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, for either recognition or pro forma disclosures to apply SFAS 123(R) using the prospective-transition method. As such, the Company will continue to apply Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, in future periods to equity awards outstanding at the date of SFAS 123(R)'s adoption that were measured using the minimum value method.
 
Effective with the adoption of SFAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006, the Company elected to use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the weighted-average fair value of options granted. In accordance with SFAS 123(R), the Company recognizes the compensation cost of share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award.
 
The determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards utilizing the Black-Scholes model is affected by the stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends.  The Company does not have a history of market prices of the common stock as it is not a public company, and as such volatility is estimated in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 and 110 ("SAB 107 and 110") using historical volatilities of similar public entities.  The expected life of the awards is estimated based on the simplified method, as defined in SAB 107 and 110. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our awards.  The dividend yield assumption is based on history and expectation of paying no dividends.  Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
 
The fair value of stock options was measured with the following weighted average assumptions:
 
 
The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $190,000 and $359,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The expense was included in the consolidated statements of operations in the following accounts (in thousands):
 
 
As of June 30, 2008, there was $922,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years.
The following is a summary of the stock option activity during the six months ended June 30, 2008:
 
 
 
The weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted during the six months ended June 30, 2008 was $5.98. The cash received from option exercises during the six months ended June 30, 2008 was $35,000.  The intrinsic value of options exercised during the six months ended June 30, 2008 was $199,000.
 
The following table summarizes information about stock options that are vested or expected to vest at June 30, 2008.
 
 
Note 4Commitments and Contingencies
 
Operating Leases
 
The Company leases certain office facilities under noncancelable operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through June 2012.  The Company leases its UK office facility under a cancelable lease that can be cancelled in June 2010. Tamale has subleased one of its offices in San Francisco through the end of its lease term on December 31, 2008. As of June 30, 2008, Tamale's remaining operating lease commitments through 2012 were approximately $1.4 million.
 
Indemnifications
 
As permitted or required under Delaware law and to the maximum extent allowable under that law, Tamale has certain obligations to indemnify its current and former officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at Tamale's request in such capacity. These indemnification obligations are valid as long as the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The maximum potential amount of future payments Tamale could be required to make under these indemnification obligations is unlimited; however, Tamale has a director and officer insurance policy that mitigates its exposure. Tamale believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is minimal.
Note 5Notes Receivable, Related Parties
 
In 2006, the Company entered into a promissory note with an employee to loan funds on an ongoing basis up to $288,000. The promissory note has an interest rate of 4.90%. As of June 30, 2008, no interest has been paid. The principal and accrued interest on the promissory note will be due on December 1, 2016. As of June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, the balance of the promissory note was $240,000 and $168,000 at June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively.  Accrued interest on the promissory note was $9,000 and $4,000 at June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively.
 
Note 6Balance Sheet Detail
 
The following is a summary of accrued liabilities (in thousands):
 
 
Note 7Fair Value Measurements
 
Effective January 1, 2008,Tamale implemented SFAS 157, "Fair Value Measurement", for the Company's financial assets and liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually.  In accordance with the provisions of FSP No. FAS 157-2, "Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157", the Company has elected to defer implementation of FAS 157 as it relates to non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis until January 1, 2009. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, this will have on the Company's non-financial assets and liabilities.
 
The adoption of SFAS 157 to the Company's financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value at least annually did not have an impact on the Company's financial results.
 
SFAS 157 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, SFAS 157 establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
 
 
This hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining inputs and determining fair value.  As of June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, the Company does not have any financial assets or liabilities that require measuring at fair value.
 
Note 8Subsequent Events
 
On July 18, 2008, the Company entered into a Letter of Intent (LOI) to be acquired by Advent Software, Inc. ("Advent"). The LOI is subject to an agreed-upon final purchase price, financing, and customary due diligence. Additionally the Company signed a promissory note with Advent for $1.0 million. Interest on the promissory note accrues at 4.09% and is due on the maturity date. The maturity date of the promissory note is dependent on certain factors, as defined in the agreement.
 
On October 1, 2008, Tamale was acquired by Advent pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the "), by and among the Advent, Tenor Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Advent ("), Tenor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Advent ("Merger LLC"), and, with respect to Article VII, Article VIII and Article IX thereof only, Robert E. Richards, Jr. as stockholder representative of Tamale and U.S. Bank National Association as escrow agent.  Pursuant to the Agreement Merger Sub merged with and into Tamale (the "First Merger"), and the surviving corporation from the First Merger merged with and into Merger LLC.
Agreement"
Merger Sub"
 
The total consideration paid by Advent in connection with the acquisition was approximately $28 million in cash and approximately 906,000 shares of the Advent's common stock, of which approximately $28 million in cash and approximately 680,000 shares of common stock were paid on the closing date.  Approximately 226,000 shares of Advent's common stock was placed into escrow for approximately one year following the closing to be held as security for losses incurred by Advent in the event of certain breaches of the representations and warranties contained in the Agreement or certain other events.  All options to acquire shares of Tamale common stock were either exercised or cancelled.

The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2008 and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 and the six months ended June 30, 2008 are based on the historical financial statements of Advent Software, Inc. and Tamale Software, Inc. after giving effect to Advent's acquisition of Tamale on October 1, 2008 as more fully described at Item 2.01 of this Form 8-K/A and applying the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2008 is presented as if the acquisition of Tamale had occurred on June 30, 2008.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2008 and year ended December 31, 2007 are presented as if the Tamale acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2007 and were carried forward through each of the respective periods.
 
The acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business Combinations". Under the purchase method of accounting, the total estimated purchase price, calculated as described in Note 1 to these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, is allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on various estimates. These preliminary estimates and assumptions are subject to change during the purchase price allocation period (generally one year from the acquisition date) as we finalize the valuations of net tangible assets, intangible assets and in-process research and development acquired.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared by management for illustrative purposes only in accordance with Article 11 of SEC Regulation S-X and are not necessarily indicative of the consolidated financial position or results of operation in future periods or the results that actually would have been realized had Advent and Tamale been a combined company during the specified periods. Certain reclassification adjustments have been made in the presentation of Tamale historical amounts to conform Tamale's financial statement basis of presentation to that followed by Advent. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, including the notes thereto, are qualified in their entirety by reference to, and should be read in conjunction with Advent's historical consolidated financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 and its Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2008, and Tamale's historical consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007 and for the six months ended June 30, 2008, which are included as Exhibits 99.2 and 99.3, respectively, to this Form 8-K/A.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note 1Basis of Presentation
 
On October 1, 2008, Advent Software, Inc. ("Advent" or the "Company") completed the acquisition of Tamale Software, Inc. ("Tamale"). Tamale provides software solutions designed specifically to help investment professionals manage their investment ideas more effectively and easily access all of the firm's research.  The total purchase price of approximately $68 million includes cash of $28 million and 906,000 shares of common stock valued at approximately $40 million.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet at June 30, 2008 is presented to give effect to Advent's acquisition of Tamale as if the transaction had been consummated on that date. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet at June 30, 2008 gives effect to Advent's acquisition of Tamale using the purchase method of accounting and applies the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations of Advent and Tamale for the year ended December 31, 2007 and the six months ended June 30, 2008 are presented as if Advent's acquisition of Tamale had been consummated on January 1, 2007. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations of Advent and Tamale for the year ended December 31, 2007 and six months ended June 30, 2008 have been prepared using the historical consolidated statements of operations data of Advent and Tamale for the year ended December 31, 2007 and the six months ended June 30, 2008 and giving effect to Advent's acquisition of Tamale using the purchase method of accounting and applying the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements.
 
Note 2Preliminary Purchase Price
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect an estimated preliminary purchase price of approximately $68 million, which was comprised of approximately $28 million in cash and 906,000 shares of Advent common stock.  For accounting purposes, the stock portion of the consideration is valued at approximately $40 million based on the average closing price of our common stock surrounding the acquisition announcement date of September 4, 2008. The total preliminary purchase price of the Tamale acquisition is as follows (in thousands):
 
 
Under the purchase method of accounting, the total preliminary purchase price as shown in the table above is allocated to Tamale's net tangible assets, intangible assets, and in-process research and development based on their estimated fair values as of October 1, 2008. The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible assets, intangible assets, and in-process research and development acquired was recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price is preliminary because final analyses of the transaction costs, intangible assets, and deferred revenue are not yet complete and are subject to change within the purchase price allocation period (generally one year from the acquisition date). A final determination of required purchase accounting
adjustments will be made upon the receipt of information required to complete Advent's analyses, which is expected to occur during the fourth quarter of 2008. The allocation of the preliminary purchase price and the estimated useful lives and first year amortization on an annualized basis associated with certain assets is as follows (in thousands):
 
 
Preliminary amortizable intangible assets totaling $22.9 million consist of existing technology, core technology, customer contracts and related relationships, trade name and trademarks, and non-competition agreements with useful lives not exceeding eight years.
 
Preliminary deferred tax assets of $4.4 million include tax effects of net operating losses.
 
Preliminary deferred tax liabilities of $9.6 million include tax effects of fair value adjustments related to identifiable intangible assets and deferred revenues.
 
Preliminary goodwill of $49.9 million represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill will not be amortized but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually (more frequently if certain indicators are present). In the event that the management of the combined company determined that the value of goodwill has become impaired, the combined company will incur an accounting charge for the amount of the impairment during the fiscal quarter in which the determination is made.
 
Note 3Pro Forma Adjustments
 
The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared as if the acquisition was completed on June 30, 2008 for balance sheet purposes and on January 1, 2007 for statements of operations purposes and reflect the following pro forma adjustments:
 
To reflect the estimated cash portion of the purchase price and resulting decrease in interest income based on the weighted average rate of return for the periods presented.
(a)
         
 
To establish amortizable intangible assets and goodwill resulting from the acquisition.
(b)
        
 
To record estimated direct transaction costs incurred by Advent.
(c)
         
 
To record the difference between the fair values and historical carrying amounts of Tamale deferred revenues and deferred costs of revenues. The fair values represent amounts equivalent to the estimated costs plus an appropriate profit margin to fulfill the obligations assumed.
(d)
        
 
To record deferred tax liability related to identifiable non-goodwill intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations at the applicable local statutory rate.
(e)
         
 
To eliminate historical stockholders' equity of Tamale.
(f)
           
 
To record the estimated fair value of Advent's shares of common stock issued in the acquisition.
(g)
        
 
To record the amortization of the intangible assets resulting from the acquisition.
(h)
        
To record repayment of notes receivable from related parties required to consummate the transaction.
(i)
            
 
To record the income tax benefit on Tamale losses which the combined company is able to recognize.
(j)
            
 
To record the income tax impact on pro forma adjustments.
(k)
         
 
To record the elimination of a valuation allowance on the Tamale deferred tax asset related to net operating losses and other temporary differences.
(l)
            
 
Certain reclassifications have been made to conform Tamale's historical financial statement presentation to Advent's financial statement presentation.
 
Note 4Pro Forma Combined Net Income Per Share
 
Shares used to calculate unaudited pro forma net income per basic and diluted share were computed by adding 906,000 shares issued as a result of the transaction for the periods ended December 31, 2007 and June 30, 2008, respectively, (using the treasury stock method) to Advent's weighted average shares outstanding.

(NASDAQ: ADVS), a leading provider of software and services for the investment management industry, today announced that the Company is expanding its executive leadership by promoting Peter Hess to the position of President of the Company, effective immediately.  Advent's CEO and Founder, Stephanie DiMarco, will continue to lead the Company as CEO.
SAN FRANCISCO 
December 4, 2008 
 
"The elevation of Pete to President marks a natural evolution in Advent's growth," said Stephanie DiMarco, Founder, CEO and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Advent.  "The Company has nearly doubled in size over the past five years, growing in both scale and complexity, and with this success comes increased organizational demands.  I'm very proud that we have the depth of experience and talent within the Company to support and augment this growth as we continue to build Advent's future."
 
In his new role of President, Mr. Hess is responsible for the worldwide marketing, sales and services for the Company's Investment Management, Global Accounts, Straight-Through-Processing (STP), Tamale Research Management groups as well as the Company's international operations.  He will continue to report to Ms. DiMarco.
 
Executive Vice President and General Manager of Advent's Investment Management Group, which generates more than half of the Company's revenue.  Prior to that, Mr. Hess was Executive Vice President and General Manager of the Global Accounts group, which established Advent's Geneva platform as the industry-leading solution for the alternative asset industry.
Mr. Hess has been with Advent since 1994.  He has held a variety of positions at the Company, including, most recently,
 
"I am thrilled and honored to have the opportunity to help lead Advent in this new capacity," said Mr. Hess.  "As our industry evolves, Advent's continued success is tied to our ability to consistently deliver mission-critical solutions that address our clients' needs and unique business challenges.  I look forward to working closely with Stephanie as well as our clients, partners and employees as we build on Advent's continued momentum."
 
"Pete has been an integral part of Advent for the last 14 years, handling a wide range of increasing responsibilities including sales, strategy, product marketing, services and support of Advent's solutions," continued Ms. DiMarco.  "He brings an in-depth understanding of Advent's customers and our industry to this position, and I am confident that he will help me continue taking Advent's operational performance to the next level and deliver even greater value to our customers."
 
 
Ms. DiMarco will continue to serve as Advent's CEO, setting the strategic vision and direction for the Company as well as managing the general and administrative side of the business.   Additionally, she will continue to hold the position of CFO, a role she had temporarily filled since earlier this year, thus ending the search for an external CFO candidate.  James Cox will continue in the role he assumed in July 2008 as Vice President and Advent's Principal Accounting Officer, working with Ms. DiMarco to manage the Company's Finance function.  Additionally, he will join the Company's executive management team.
 
"We have a phenomenal internal Finance team, and I have decided to work on building the capabilities of the existing team as opposed to bringing in a CFO from the outside," added Ms. DiMarco.  "Jim Cox, in particular, has done a fantastic job as Advent's Principal Accounting Officer since assuming the role earlier this year, and he will be a welcome addition to our executive team."
 
Ms. DiMarco concluded, "Advent has always been a company focused on the future, whether it's anticipating our customers' needs, understanding the evolving dynamics of our industry, or creating a company that is built to last.  The organizational changes we're announcing today are further evidence of our commitment to ensuring Advent's success, both today and well into the future."

To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than one hundred twenty (120) calendar days before the one year anniversary of the date on which the corporation first mailed its proxy statement to stockholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders.  A stockholder's notice to the secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting: (A) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (B) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation's books, of the stockholder proposing such business, (C) the class and number of shares of the corporation that are beneficially owned by the stockholder, (D) any material interest of the stockholder in such business, and (E) any other information that is required to be provided by the stockholder pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to include information with respect to a stockholder proposal in the proxy statement and form of proxy for a stockholder's meeting, stockholders must provide notice as required by the regulations promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (a). The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (a), and, if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting that any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
 
(b)           Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b) shall be eligible for election as directors. Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors of the corporation may be made at a meeting of stockholders by or at the direction of the board of directors or by any stockholder of the corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this paragraph (b). Such nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the board of directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the secretary of the corporation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Section 2.5. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (i) as to each person, if any, whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director: (A) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (B) the principal occupation or employment of such person, (C) the class and number of shares of the corporation that are beneficially owned by such person, (D) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nominations are to be made by the stockholder, and (E) any other information relating to such person that is required  to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for elections of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including without limitation such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement, if any, as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); and (ii) as to such stockholder giving notice, the information required to be provided pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 2.5. At the request of the board of directors, any person nominated by a stockholder for election as a director shall furnish to the secretary of the corporation that information required to be set forth in the stockholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b).  The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these bylaws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting, and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
 
These provisions shall not prevent the consideration and approval or disapproval at an annual meeting of reports of officers, directors and committees of the board of directors, but in connection therewith no new business shall be acted upon at any such meeting unless stated, filed and received as herein provided.  Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the contrary, no business brought
 
before a meeting by a stockholder shall be conducted at an annual meeting except in accordance with procedures set forth in this Section 2.5.

Such consents shall be delivered to the corporation by delivery to it registered office in the state of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded.

If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.

A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission, telefacsimile or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact.

If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.  If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.

If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten(10) percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable.

For purposes of this Section 6.1, a "director" or "officer" of the corporation shall mean any person (i) who is or was a director or officer of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was a director or officer of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.
 
The corporation shall be required to indemnify a director or officer in connection with an action, suit, or proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such director or officer only if the initiation of such action, suit, or proceeding (or part thereof) by the director or officer was authorized by the board of Directors of the corporation.
 
The corporation shall pay the expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred by a director or officer of the corporation entitled to indemnification hereunder in defending any action, suit or proceeding referred to in this Section 6.1 in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that payment of expenses incurred by a director or officer of the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the director or officer to repay all amounts advanced if it should ultimately be determined that the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 6.1 or otherwise.
 
The rights conferred on any person by this Article shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, these bylaws, agreement, vote of the stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
 
Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.

For purposes of this Section 6.2, an "employee" or "agent" of the corporation (other than a director or officer) shall mean any person (i) who is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was an employee or agent of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.

6.4         
SAVINGS CLAUSE
 
If this Article VI or any portion thereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation against expenses (including attorney's fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, and whether internal or external, including a grand jury proceeding and an action or suit brought by or in the right of the corporation, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law.

6.6         
NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS

ARTICLE VIII
 
GENERAL MATTERS
 
8.1         
RECORD DATE FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN NOTICE AND VOTING
 
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted and which shall not be more than sixty (60) days before any such action.  In that case, only stockholders of record at the close of business on the date so fixed are entitled to receive the dividend, distribution or allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date so fixed, except as otherwise provided by law.
 
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, then the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the applicable resolution.
 
8.2         
CHECKS; DRAFTS; EVIDENCES OF INDEBTEDNESS
 
From time to time, the board of directors shall determine by resolution which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness that are issued in the name of or payable to the corporation, and only the persons so authorized shall sign or endorse those instruments.
8.3         
FISCAL YEAR
 
The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the board of directors.
 
8.4         
CORPORATE CONTRACTS AND INSTRUMENTS:  HOW EXECUTED
 
The board of directors, except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, may authorize and empower any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation; such power and authority may be general or confined to specific instances.  Unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.
 
8.5         
STOCK CERTIFICATES; TRANSFER; PARTLY PAID SHARES
 
The shares of the corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the board of directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares.  Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation.  Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the board of directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and, upon request, every holder of uncertificated shares, shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, the chairman or vice-chairman of the board of directors, or the president or vice-president, and by the treasurer or an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant secretary of such corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form.  Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile.  In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
 
Certificates for shares shall be of such form and device as the board of directors may designate and shall state the name of the record holder of the shares represented thereby; its number; date of issuance; the number of shares for which it is issued; a summary statement or reference to the powers, designations, preferences or other special rights of such stock and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights, if any; a statement or summary of liens, if any; a conspicuous notice of restrictions upon transfer or registration of transfer, if any; a statement as to any applicable voting trust agreement; if the shares be assessable, or, if assessments are collectible by personal action, a plain statement of such facts.
 
Upon surrender to the secretary or transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.
The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor.  Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated.  Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.
 
8.6         
SPECIAL DESIGNATION ON CERTIFICATES
 
If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
 
8.7         
LOST CERTIFICATES
 
Except as provided in this Section 8.7, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and cancelled at the same time.  The board of directors may, in case any share certificate or certificate for any other security is lost, stolen or destroyed, authorize the issuance of replacement certificates on such terms and conditions as the board may require; the board may require indemnification of the corporation secured by a bond or other adequate security sufficient to protect the corporation against any claim that may be made against it, including any expense or liability, on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of the certificate or the issuance of the replacement certificate.
 
8.8         
TRANSFER AGENTS AND REGISTRARS
 
The board of directors may appoint one or more transfer agents or transfer clerks, and one or more registrars, each of which shall be an incorporated bank or trust company  either domestic or foreign, who shall be appointed at such times and places as the requirements of the corporation may necessitate and the board of directors may designate.
 
8.9         
CONSTRUCTION; DEFINITIONS
 
Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction and definitions in the General Corporation Law of Delaware shall govern the construction of these
bylaws.  Without limiting the generality of this provision, as used in these bylaws, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the term "person" includes both an entity and a natural person.
 
ARTICLE IX
 
AMENDMENTS
 
The original or other bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon the directors.  The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.
 
Whenever an amendment or new bylaw is adopted, it shall be copied in the book of bylaws with the original bylaws, in the appropriate place.  If any bylaw is repealed, the fact of repeal with the date of the meeting at which the repeal was enacted or the filing of the operative written consent(s) shall be stated in said book.

If during the term of this Lease, Taxes are required to be paid (either to the appropriate taxing authorities or as tax escrow payments to a superior mortgagee) in full or in monthly, quarterly, or other installments, on any other date or dates than as presently required, then at Landlord's option, Tenant's Tax Payments shall be correspondingly accelerated or revised so that said Tenant's Tax Payments are due at least thirty (30) days prior to the date payments are due to the taxing authorities or such superior mortgagee.

If (i) submetering of electricity is prohibited as described in hereof and Tenant does not elect to obtain electricity from the public utility company, or (ii) if and to the extent that the Premises or any portion of Tenant's electric consumption (KW and KWHR) is measured on a meter that also measures the electric consumption of another tenant occupying space in the Building, then in any such case Landlord shall furnish electricity to Tenant on the basis that Tenant's consumption (KW and KWHR) of electricity shall be measured by electric survey made from time to time by Landlord's consultant.  Pending an initial survey made by Landlord's consultant, effective as of the date when Landlord has commenced furnishing electricity to Tenant pursuant to this (with suitable proration for any period of less than a full calendar month), the Fixed Rent specified in hereof shall be increased by an amount (the "") which shall be at the rate of $3.25 per rentable square foot per annum, provided that such amount per annum is subject to increase based on increases in Landlord's cost of electricity, or in the event the reason is (i) above, then, if there has been twelve (12) months charges of submetered electric, an amount equal to the average of the prior twelve (12) months charges for submetered electric, but in any case, with at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of any such increase (, that the effective date of such adjustment shall be the date such increased use commenced, as determined by the electrical survey).  After completion of the electrical survey made by Landlord's consultant of Tenant's consumption (KW and KWHR) of electricity, said consultant shall apply 103% of Landlord's Rate as provided in hereof to arrive at an amount (the "") and the Fixed Rent shall be appropriately adjusted retroactively to reflect

Tenant shall pay that portion of such amount which would have been paid to the date of the determination of the Actual Charge within thirty (30) days after being billed therefor.  Thereafter and from time to time during the term of the Lease, Landlord may cause additional surveys of Tenant's electrical usage to be made by Landlord's consultant.  Tenant from time to time may request Landlord to have a survey made of Tenant's electrical usage, and the fees of Landlord's consultant making such survey(s) at Tenant's request shall be paid by Tenant.  In the event any of the foregoing surveys shall determine that there has been an increase or decrease in Tenant's usage of electricity, then effective as of the date of such change in usage the then current Actual Charge to Tenant by reason of the furnishing of electricity to Tenant, as same may have been previously increased pursuant to the terms hereof, shall be increased or decreased (subject to the last sentence of  hereof) in accordance with such survey determination with appropriate credit allowed to Tenant in the event of a decrease in usage and in the event of an increase in such usage Tenant shall pay the increased amount therefor from the date of such change in usage to the date of such survey determination within thirty (30) days after being billed therefor and thereafter as part of the increased monthly charge for electricity by reason of such survey determination.

In the event from time to time after the initial survey or a subsequent survey any additional electrically operated equipment is installed in the Premises by Tenant, or if Tenant shall increase its hours of operation, or if the charges by the utility company supplying electric current to Landlord are increased or decreased after the date thereof, then and in any of such events the monthly charge shall be increased or decreased accordingly on account of such additional electricity consumed by such newly installed electrically operated equipment and/or increase in Tenant's hours of operation and/or on account of such increased or decreased Landlord's Rate.  The amount of such increase or decrease in the monthly charge shall be determined in the first instance by Landlord's consultant.  In addition, the monthly rate will be increased or decreased quarterly in accordance with calculations by Landlord's consultant to reflect changes in the fuel adjustment component of the utility company charge.  Tenant shall pay the amount of any increase in the monthly charge retroactively (subject to Tenant's right to contest in the same manner as in hereof provided) from the date of the installation of all newly installed electrically operated equipment and/or from the date when the increased charges to Landlord from the utility company become effective and/or from the date of any increase in Tenant's hours of operation, as the case may be, such amount to be paid promptly upon billing therefor by Landlord.

In the event electricity shall be furnished to Tenant as contemplated in hereof, then Tenant, within sixty (60) days after notification from Landlord of the determination of Landlord's utility consultant (in accordance with the provisions of hereof), shall have the right to contest, at Tenant's cost and expense, such determination by submitting to Landlord a like survey determination prepared by a utility consultant of Tenant's selection, which will highlight the differences between Landlord's survey and Tenant's survey.  If the determination of Tenant's consultant does not vary from the determination of Landlord's consultant by more than five percent (5%), then Landlord's determination shall be deemed binding and conclusive.  If the determination of Tenant's consultant varies by more than five percent (5%) and if Landlord's consultant and Tenant's consultant shall be unable to reach agreement within thirty (30) days, then such two consultants shall designate a third consultant to make the determination, and the determination of such third consultant shall be binding and conclusive on both Landlord and Tenant.  If the determination of such third consultant shall substantially confirm the findings of Landlord's consultant (, within five percent (5%)), then Tenant shall pay the cost of such third consultant.  If such third consultant shall substantially confirm the determination of Tenant's consultant (, within five percent (5%)), then Landlord shall pay the cost of such third consultant.  If such third consultant shall make a determination substantially different from that of both Landlord's and Tenant's consultants (or is within five percent (5%) of both such determinations), then the cost of such third consultant shall be borne equally by Landlord and Tenant.  In the event that Landlord's consultant and Tenant's consultant shall be unable to agree upon the designation of a third consultant within thirty (30) days after Tenant's consultant shall have made its determination (different from that of Landlord's consultant), then either party shall have the right to request The Real Estate Board of New York, Inc. (or, upon their failure or refusal to act, the American Arbitration Association in the City of New York) to designate a third consultant whose decision shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties, and the costs of such third consultant shall be borne as hereinbefore provided in the case of a third consultant designated by the Landlord's and Tenant's consultants.  Pending the resolution of any contest pursuant to the terms hereof, Tenant shall pay the Additional Charge on account of electricity determined by Landlord's consultant, and upon the resolution of such contest, appropriate adjustment in accordance with such resolution of such Additional Charge payable by Tenant on account of electricity shall be made retroactive to the date of the determination of Landlord's consultant.

If the Building shall be totally damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty, or if the Building shall be so damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty (whether or not the Premises are damaged or destroyed) that its repair or restoration requires more than twelve (12) months and the expenditure of more than thirty (30%) percent of the full insurable value of the Building immediately prior to the casualty (as estimated in any such case by a reputable contractor, registered architect or licensed professional engineer designated by Landlord), and provided Landlord shall terminate Leases covering no less than fifty (50%) percent of the office space in the Building then leased to tenants (including Tenant) in the
Building, then in such case Landlord may terminate this Lease by giving Tenant notice to such effect within one hundred fifty (150) days after the date of the casualty.  For the purpose of this Section only, "full insurable value" shall mean replacement cost less the cost of footings, foundations and other structures below the street and first floors of the Building.

This Lease shall be and remain unaffected by such taking and Tenant shall continue to be responsible for all of its obligations hereunder insofar as such obligations are not affected by such taking and shall continue to pay in full the Fixed Rent and Additional Charges when due.  If the period of temporary use or occupancy shall extend beyond the Expiration Date of this Lease, that part of the award which represents compensation for the use and occupancy of the Premises (or a part thereof) shall be divided between Landlord and Tenant so that Tenant shall receive so much thereof as represents the period up to and including such Expiration Date and Landlord shall receive so much thereof as represents the period after such Expiration Date.  All monies paid as, or as part of, an award for temporary use and occupancy for a period beyond the date to which the Fixed Rent and Additional Charges have been paid shall be received, held and applied by Landlord as a trust fund for payment of the Fixed Rent and Additional Charges becoming due hereunder.

Lease
Premises
 
WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to make the Lease subject and subordinate to the Mortgage and the Loan Agreement;
 
NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, in consideration of the covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, hereby agree as follows:
 
The Lease, as the same may hereafter be modified, amended, extended, renewed, increased, spread, consolidated or replaced, and all of Tenant's right, title and interest in and to the Premises and all rights, remedies and options of Tenant under the Lease, are and shall be unconditionally subject and subordinate to the Mortgage and the lien thereof, to all the terms, conditions and provisions of the Mortgage and the Loan Agreement, to each and every advance made or hereafter made under the Loan Agreement, and to all renewals, modifications,
1.
            
 
consolidations, replacements, substitutions and extensions of the Mortgage and/or the Loan Agreement, so that at all times the Mortgage shall be and remain a lien on the Property prior and superior to the Lease for all purposes; provided, however, and Lender agrees, that so long as (A) no event has occurred and no condition exists, which would entitle Landlord to terminate the Lease or would cause, without further action of Landlord, the termination of the Lease or would entitle Landlord to dispossess Tenant from the Premises, and (B) the Lease shall be in full force and effect, then Tenant's leasehold estate under the Lease shall not be terminated, Tenant's possession of the Premises shall not be disturbed by Lender and Lender will accept the attornment of Tenant.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Lease, Tenant hereby agrees that in the event of any act, omission or default by Landlord or Landlord's agents, employees, contractors, licensees or invitees which would give Tenant the right, either immediately or after the lapse of a period of time, to terminate the Lease, or to claim a partial or total eviction, or to reduce the rent payable thereunder or credit or offset any amounts against future rents payable thereunder, Tenant will not exercise any such right (i) until it has given written notice of such act, omission or default to Lender by delivering notice of such act, omission or default, in accordance with Paragraph 8 hereof, and (ii) until a period of sixty (60) days for remedying such act, omission or default shall have elapsed following the giving of such notice.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any default of Landlord which cannot be cured within such sixty (60) day period, if Lender shall within such period proceed promptly to cure the same (including such time as may be necessary to acquire possession of the Premises if possession is necessary to effect such cure) and thereafter shall prosecute the curing of such default with diligence, then the time within which such default may be cured by Lender shall be extended for such period as may be necessary to complete the curing of the same with diligence but not to exceed 120 days following such  notice.  Lender's cure of Landlord's default shall not be considered an assumption by Lender of Landlord's other obligations under the Lease.  Unless Lender otherwise agrees in writing, Landlord shall remain solely liable to perform Landlord's obligations under the Lease (but only to the extent required by and subject to the limitation included with the Lease), both before and after Lender's exercise of any right or remedy under this Agreement.  If Lender or any successor or assign becomes obligated to perform as Landlord under the Lease, such person or entity will be released from those obligations when such person or entity assigns, sells or otherwise transfers its interest in the Premises or the Property.
2.
            
 
Without limitation of any of the provisions of the Lease, in the event that Lender succeeds to the interest of Landlord or any successor to Landlord, then subject to the provisions of this Agreement including, without limitation, Paragraph 1 above, the Lease shall nevertheless continue in full force and effect and Tenant shall and does hereby agree to attorn to and accept Lender  and to recognize Lender as its Landlord under the Lease for the then remaining balance of the term thereof, and upon request of Lender, Tenant shall execute and deliver to Lender an agreement of attornment reasonably satisfactory to Lender.
3.
            
 
If Lender or any other subsequent purchaser of the Property succeeds to the interest of Landlord or any successor to Landlord (Lender or such other purchaser being hereinafter referred to as ""), in no event shall Purchaser have any liability for any act or omission of any prior landlord under the Lease which occurs prior to the date Purchaser succeeds to the rights of Landlord under the Lease unless such act or omission continues from
4.
            
Purchaser
 
and after the date Purchaser so succeeds to the interest of the Landlord under the lease, nor any liability for claims, offsets (except as specifically permitted under the Lease) or defenses which Tenant might have had against Landlord unless the act or omission giving rise to such claim, offset or defense continues from and after the date Purchaser so succeeds to the interest of the Landlord under the lease.  In no event shall Purchaser have any personal liability as successor to Landlord and Tenant shall look only to the estate and property of Purchaser in the Land and the Improvements for the satisfaction of Tenant's remedies for the collection of a judgment (or other judicial process) requiring the payment of money in the event of any default by Purchaser as Landlord under the Lease, and no other property or assets of Purchaser shall be subject to levy, execution or other enforcement procedure for the satisfaction of Tenant's remedies under or with respect to the Lease.
 
Lender and Tenant agree that upon the conveyance of the Property by reason of the foreclosure of the Mortgage or the acceptance of a deed or assignment in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise, Lender, as holder of the Mortgage, and Purchaser as Landlord under the Lease (the "") shall not be (a) liable for the return of rental security deposits, if any, paid by Tenant to Landlord in accordance with the Lease unless such sums are actually received by the Transferee, (b) bound by any payment of rents, additional rents or other sums which Tenant may have paid more than one (1) month in advance to any prior Landlord unless (i) such sums are actually received by the Transferee or (ii) such prepayment shall have been expressly approved of by the Transferee, (c) bound to make any payment to Tenant which was required under the Lease, or otherwise, to be made prior to the time the Transferee succeeded to Landlord's interest, (d) bound by any agreement amending, modifying or terminating the Lease made without the Lender's prior written consent prior to the time the Transferee succeeded to Landlord's interest or (d) bound by any assignment of the Lease or sublease of the Property, or any portion thereof, made prior to the time the Transferee succeeded to Landlord's interest other than if pursuant to the provisions of the Lease.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Tenant agrees that Lender, as holder of the Mortgage, and Purchaser as Landlord under the Lease if it succeeds to that position, shall in no event have any liability for the performance or completion of any initial work or installations or for any loan or contribution or rent concession towards initial work, which are required to be made by Landlord (A) under the Lease or under any related Lease documents or (B) for any space which may hereafter become part of said Premises, and any such requirement shall be inoperative in the event Purchaser succeeds to the position of Landlord prior to the completion or performance thereof; provided, however, if, after succeeding to Landlord's interest under the Lease, any Purchaser or successor owner fails or refuses to perform or complete any such initial work or installations which Landlord would have been obligated to perform and complete or fails or refuses to make any loan or contribution towards initial work which are required to be made by Landlord, Tenant shall be entitled to exercise any and all remedies provided to Tenant by the Lease for a failure by Landlord to perform or complete any such initial work or installations or to make such loan or contribution, other than direct recourse against Lender or such Purchaser.  Tenant further agrees with Lender that Tenant will not voluntarily subordinate the Lease to any lien or encumbrance without Lender's prior written consent.

Transferee
 
This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute and be construed as one and the same instrument.
6.
            
 
All remedies which Lender may have against Landlord provided herein, if any, are cumulative and shall be in addition to any and all other rights and remedies provided by law and by other agreements between Lender and Landlord or others.  If any party consists of multiple individuals or entities, each of same shall be jointly and severally liable for the obligations of such party hereunder.
7.
            
 
All notices to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed served upon receipt by the addressee if served personally or, if mailed, upon the first to occur of receipt or the refusal of delivery as shown on a return receipt, after deposit in the United States Postal Service certified mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the address of Landlord, Tenant or Lender appearing below, or, if sent by telegram, when delivered by or refused upon attempted delivery by the telegraph office.
8.
            
 
 
Such addresses may be changed by notice given in the same manner.  If any party consists of multiple individuals or entities, then notice to any one of same shall be deemed notice to such party.
 
This Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the state in which the Property is located.  If any term, covenant or condition of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, this Agreement shall be construed without such provision.
10.
          
 
This Agreement shall apply to, bind and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.  As used herein "Lender" shall include any subsequent holder of the Mortgage.
11.
          
 
Tenant acknowledges that Landlord has assigned to Lender its right, title and interest in the Lease and to the rents, issues and profits of the Property and the Property pursuant to the Mortgage, and that Landlord has been granted the license to collect such rents provided no Event of Default has occurred under, and as defined in, the Mortgage.  Tenant agrees to pay all rents and other amounts due under the Lease directly to Lender upon receipt of written demand by Lender, and Landlord hereby consents thereto.  The assignment of the Lease to Lender, or the collection of rents by Lender pursuant to such assignment, shall not obligate Lender to perform Landlord's obligations under the Lease.
12.
          
 
Lender may sell, transfer and deliver the promissory note secured by the Mortgage ("") and assign the Mortgage, this Agreement and the other documents executed in connection therewith to one or more investors in the secondary mortgage market ("").

All references to Lender herein shall refer to and include any such servicer to the extent applicable.

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 and year ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 are presented as if the MicroEdge disposition had occurred on January 1, 2006 and were carried though each of the respective periods.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management for illustrative purposes only in accordance with Article 11 of SEC Regulation S-X and are not necessarily indicative of the condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations in future periods or the results that actually would have been realized had Advent and MicroEdge not been a combined company during the specified periods.

Note 1Basis of Presentation
 
On October 1, 2009, Advent Software, Inc. (the "") completed the sale of MicroEdge, Inc.
Company
("") a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "") entered on July 27, 2009, by and among the Company, Microedge Holdings, LLC (""), a Delaware limited liability company and an affiliate of Vista Equity Partners III, LLC, Microedge Merger Sub, LLC, a New York limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Purchaser (""), MicroEdge, and, with respect to Article VII, Article VIII and Article IX thereof only, U.S. Bank National Association as escrow agent. Pursuant to the Agreement, MicroEdge merged with and into Merger Sub.
MicroEdge
Agreement
Purchaser
Merger Sub
 
The total consideration received by the Company in connection with the disposition was approximately $30 million in cash, of which approximately $27 million in cash was paid on the closing date. Approximately $3 million of the Purchase Price has been placed in
escrow for eighteen (18) months following the close to be held as security for losses that may be incurred by the Purchaser in the event of certain breaches of the representations and warranties contained in the Agreement or certain other events.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2009 is presented to give effect to Advent's disposition of MicroEdge as if the transaction had been consummated on that date. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 and years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 are presented as if Advent's disposition of MicroEdge had been consummated on January 1, 2006 and applying the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to these unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements.
 
Note 2Pro Forma Adjustments
 
The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the following pro forma adjustments:
 
(A)
      
To reflect the elimination of asset, liability and accumulated other comprehensive loss amounts associated with the discontinued operations of MicroEdge in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") ASC 360, "Property, Plant, and Equipment" and ASC 205-20 "Discontinued Operations", as if the sale had been consummated on June 30, 2009.
 
(B)
      
To reflect the portion of the sale proceeds received less transaction costs paid on October 1, 2009, as if the sale had been consummated on June 30, 2009.
 
(C)
      
To reflect the preliminary gain on sale, net of tax, and pro forma taxes payable as if the sale had been consummated on June 30, 2009. The Company applied the statutory tax rate of 42% for pro forma purposes. The gain on sale is preliminary because final analyses of the sale consideration, asset, liability, and other comprehensive loss amounts as well as the effective tax rate are not yet complete. When the final accounting for the gain is made, a significant portion of the income tax related to the sale will reduce deferred tax assets rather than increase income taxes payable. A final determination of the gain on sale, and the underlying tax impact, including whether any amounts are payable, will be made when the Company reports its results for the fourth quarter of 2009.
 
(D)
      
To eliminate the financial results of operations associated with the discontinued operations of MicroEdge in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") ASC 360, "Property, Plant, and Equipment" and ASC 205-20, "Discontinued Operations", as if the sale had been consummated on January 1, 2006.
 
The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements do not reflect the following:
 
                 
The Purchase Price proceeds of $3 million that are being held in escrow for eighteen months following the close of sale. Due to the uncertainty regarding the realization of this asset which is being held as security for losses that may be incurred by the Purchaser, the Company has excluded this item from its pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements.
 
                 
Estimated restructuring charges of $4 million, consisting primarily of facility exit costs, related to Advent's vacating of its leased property located at 619 West 54

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to include information with respect to a stockholder proposal in the proxy statement and form of proxy for a stockholder's meeting, stockholders must provide notice as required by the regulations promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (a). The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (a), and, if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting that any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
 
Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b) shall be eligible for election as directors. Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors of the corporation may be made at a meeting of stockholders by or at the direction of the board of directors or by any stockholder of the corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this paragraph (b). Such nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the board of directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the secretary of the corporation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Section 2.5. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (i) as to each person, if any, whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director: (A) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (B) the principal occupation or employment of such person, (C) the class and number of shares of the corporation that are beneficially owned by such person, (D) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nominations are to be made by the stockholder, and (E) any other information relating to such person that is required  to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for elections of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including without limitation such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement, if any, as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); and (ii) as to such stockholder giving notice, the information required to be provided pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 2.5. At the request of the board of directors, any person nominated by a stockholder for election as a director shall furnish to the secretary of the corporation that information required to be set forth in the stockholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b).  The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these bylaws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting, and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
(b)
                                
 
These provisions shall not prevent the consideration and approval or disapproval at an annual meeting of reports of officers, directors and committees of the board of directors, but in connection therewith no new business shall be acted upon at any such meeting unless stated, filed and received as herein provided.

The corporation shall, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended, indemnify any person against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, or proceeding in which such person was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the corporation.  For purposes of this Section 6.1, a "director" or "officer" of the corporation shall mean any person (i) who is or was a director or officer of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was a director or officer of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.
 
The corporation shall be required to indemnify a director or officer in connection with an action, suit, or proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such director or officer only if the initiation of such action, suit, or proceeding (or part thereof) by the director or officer was authorized by the board of Directors of the corporation.
 
The corporation shall pay the expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred by a director or officer of the corporation entitled to indemnification hereunder in defending any action, suit or proceeding referred to in this Section 6.1 in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that payment of expenses incurred by a director or officer of the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the director or officer to repay all amounts advanced if it should ultimately be determined that the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 6.1 or otherwise.
 
The rights conferred on any person by this Article shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, these bylaws, agreement, vote of the stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
 
Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.

The corporation shall have the power, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended, to indemnify any person (other than directors and officers) against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, or proceeding, in which such person was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party by reason of the fact that such person is or was an employee or agent of the corporation.  For purposes of this Section 6.2, an "employee" or "agent" of the corporation (other than a director or officer) shall mean any person (i) who is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was an employee or agent of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.

6.4         
SAVINGS CLAUSE
 
If this Article VI or any portion thereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation against expenses (including attorney's fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, and whether internal or external, including a grand jury proceeding and an action or suit brought by or in the right of the corporation, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law.

6.6         
NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS
 
The rights conferred on any person by this bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office.

7.2

ARTICLE VIII GENERAL MATTERS
 
8.1         
RECORD DATE FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN NOTICE AND VOTING
 
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted and which shall not be more than sixty (60) days before any such action.  In that case, only stockholders of record at the close of business on the date so fixed are entitled to receive the dividend, distribution or allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date so fixed, except as otherwise provided by law.
 
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, then the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the applicable resolution.
 
8.2         
CHECKS; DRAFTS; EVIDENCES OF INDEBTEDNESS
 
From time to time, the board of directors shall determine by resolution which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness that are issued in the name of or payable to the corporation, and only the persons so authorized shall sign or endorse those instruments.
 
8.3         
FISCAL YEAR
 
The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the board of directors.
 
8.4         
CORPORATE CONTRACTS AND INSTRUMENTS:  HOW EXECUTED
 
The board of directors, except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, may authorize and empower any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation; such power and authority may be general or confined to specific instances.  Unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.
 
8.5         
STOCK CERTIFICATES; TRANSFER; PARTLY PAID SHARES
 
The shares of the corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the board of directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares.  Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation.  Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the board of directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and, upon request, every holder of uncertificated shares, shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, the chairman or vice-chairman of the board of directors, or the president or vice-president, and by the treasurer or an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant secretary of such corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form.  Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile.  In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
 
Certificates for shares shall be of such form and device as the board of directors may designate and shall state the name of the record holder of the shares represented thereby; its number; date of issuance; the number of shares for which it is issued; a summary statement or reference to the powers, designations, preferences or other special rights of such stock and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights, if any; a statement or summary of liens, if any; a conspicuous notice of restrictions upon transfer or registration of transfer, if any; a statement as to any applicable voting trust agreement; if the shares be assessable, or, if assessments are collectible by personal action, a plain statement of such facts.
 
Upon surrender to the secretary or transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.
 
The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor.  Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated.  Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.
 
8.6         
SPECIAL DESIGNATION ON CERTIFICATES
 
If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
 
8.7         
LOST CERTIFICATES
 
Except as provided in this Section 8.7, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and cancelled at the same time.  The board of directors may, in case any share certificate or certificate for any other security is lost, stolen or destroyed, authorize the issuance of replacement certificates on such terms and conditions as the board may require; the board may require indemnification of the corporation secured by a bond or other adequate security sufficient to protect the corporation against any claim that may be made against it, including any expense or liability, on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of the certificate or the issuance of the replacement certificate.
 
8.8         
TRANSFER AGENTS AND REGISTRARS
 
The board of directors may appoint one or more transfer agents or transfer clerks, and one or more registrars, each of which shall be an incorporated bank or trust company  either domestic or foreign, who shall be appointed at such times and places as the requirements of the corporation may necessitate and the board of directors may designate.
 
8.9         
CONSTRUCTION; DEFINITIONS
 
Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction and definitions in the General Corporation Law of Delaware shall govern the construction of these
 
bylaws.  Without limiting the generality of this provision, as used in these bylaws, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the term "person" includes both an entity and a natural person.
 
ARTICLE IX AMENDMENTS
 
The original or other bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon the directors.  The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.
 
Whenever an amendment or new bylaw is adopted, it shall be copied in the book of bylaws with the original bylaws, in the appropriate place.  If any bylaw is repealed, the fact of repeal with the date of the meeting at which the repeal was enacted or the filing of the operative written consent(s) shall be stated in said book.

In addition, to be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the secretary must be supplemented not later than ten days following the record date to disclose the information contained in clauses (C), (D) and (E) above as of the record date.

agent of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was an employee or agent of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.

or other person entitled to indemnification pursuant to these bylaws (except by reason of the fact that such officer is or was a director of the corporation in which event this paragraph shall not apply) in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the proceeding, or (ii) if such quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.

ARTICLE VIII GENERAL MATTERS
 
8.1         
RECORD DATE FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN NOTICE AND VOTING
 
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action other than as provided for in Article II of these Bylaws, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted and which shall not be more than sixty (60) calendar days before any such action.  In that case, only stockholders of record at the close of business on the date so fixed are entitled to receive the dividend, distribution or allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date so fixed, except as otherwise provided by law.
 
If the Board of Directors does not so fix a record date, then the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the applicable resolution.
8.2         
CHECKS; DRAFTS; EVIDENCES OF INDEBTEDNESS
 
From time to time, the Board of Directors shall determine by resolution which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness that are issued in the name of or payable to the corporation, and only the persons so authorized shall sign or endorse those instruments.
 
8.3         
FISCAL YEAR
 
The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors.
 
8.4         
CORPORATE CONTRACTS AND INSTRUMENTS:  HOW EXECUTED
 
The Board of Directors, except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws, may authorize and empower any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation; such power and authority may be general or confined to specific instances.  Unless so authorized or ratified by the Board of Directors or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.
 
8.5         
STOCK CERTIFICATES; TRANSFER; PARTLY PAID SHARES
 
The shares of the corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board of Directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares.  Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation.  Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the Board of Directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and, upon request, every holder of uncertificated shares, shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, the chairman or vice-chairman of the Board of Directors, or the president or vice-president, and by the chief financial officer or an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant secretary of such corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form.  Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile.  In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
 
Certificates for shares shall be of such form and device as the Board of Directors may designate and shall state the name of the record holder of the shares represented thereby; its number; date of issuance; the number of shares for which it is issued; a summary statement or reference to the powers, designations, preferences or other special rights of such stock and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights, if any; a statement or summary of liens, if any; a conspicuous notice of restrictions upon transfer or registration of transfer, if any; a
statement as to any applicable voting trust agreement; and if the shares be assessable, or, if assessments are collectible by personal action, a plain statement of such facts.
Upon surrender to the secretary or transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.
 
The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor.  Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated.  Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.
 
8.6         
SPECIAL DESIGNATION ON CERTIFICATES
 
If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to transfers of stock, stock certificates and uncertificated stock), in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
 
8.7         
LOST CERTIFICATES
 
Except as provided in this Section 8.7, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and canceled at the same time.  The Board of Directors may, in case any share certificate or certificate for any other security is lost, stolen or destroyed, authorize the issuance of replacement certificates on such terms and conditions as the board may require; the board may require indemnification of the corporation secured by a bond or other adequate security sufficient to protect the corporation against any claim that may be made against it, including any expense or liability, on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of the certificate or the issuance of the replacement certificate.
8.8         
TRANSFER AGENTS AND REGISTRARS
 
The Board of Directors may appoint one or more transfer agents or transfer clerks, and one or more registrars, each of which shall be an incorporated bank or trust company  either domestic or foreign, who shall be appointed at such times and places as the requirements of the corporation may necessitate and the Board of Directors may designate.
 
8.9

.
8.10
        PROVISIONS ADDITIONAL TO PROVISIONS OF LAW
 
  Any article, section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause or phrase of these Bylaws which upon being construed in the manner provided in Section 8.11 hereof, shall be contrary to or inconsistent with any applicable provisions of law, shall not apply so long as said provisions of law shall remain in effect, but such result shall not affect the validity or applicability of any other portions of these Bylaws, it being hereby declared that these Bylaws would have been adopted and each article, section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more articles, sections, subsections, subdivisions, sentences, clauses or phrases is or are illegal.
.
8.11
        PROVISIONS CONTRARY TO PROVISIONS OF LAW
 
  Any reference in these Bylaws to the time a notice is given or sent means, unless otherwise expressly provided, the time a written notice by mail is deposited in the United States mails, postage prepaid; or the time any other written notice is personally delivered to the recipient or is delivered to a common carrier for transmission, or actually transmitted by the person giving the notice by electronic means, to the recipient; or the time any oral notice is communicated, in person or by telephone or wireless means, to the recipient or to a person at the office of the recipient who the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the recipient.

        NOTICES
ARTICLE IX
NOTICE BY ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION

NOTICE BY ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION
 
(i)            the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent; and
 
(ii)           such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the Corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice.
 
However, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.
 
Any notice given pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be deemed given:
 
(i)            if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice;
 
(ii)           if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice;
 
(iii)          if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and
 
(iv)          if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder.
 
An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the Corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
  An "electronic transmission" means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved, and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.

Subject to Section 6.7 hereof, the original or other Bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed at any annual or special meeting of stockholders, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat.  The corporation may, in its Certificate of Incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws upon the Board of Directors.  The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the Board of Directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws.
 
Whenever an amendment or new bylaw is adopted, it shall be copied in the book of Bylaws with the original Bylaws, in the appropriate place.  If any bylaw is repealed, the fact of repeal with the date of the meeting at which the repeal was enacted or the filing of the operative written consent(s) shall be stated in said book.

Exhibit 10.1
 
The Advent Software 2010 Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan") is designed to motivate and reward the executives that are members of Advent's Executive Management Team (the "Executives") for short-term achievement of Annual Contract Value, Recognized Revenue and Operating Profit milestones during the 2010 fiscal year.
 
Annual Contract Value (ACV) represents the average contribution to annual revenue from all new term license contracts, entered into during the year (consistent with the methodology used to calculate and report ACV in our annual report on Form 10-K), plus the estimated average contribution to annual revenue from new data-related or outsourcing contracts entered into during the year.
 
Recognized Revenue represents the revenue recognized in earnings by the Company in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (US GAAP) and is consistent with "Net Revenues" reported in our consolidated financial statements.
 
Operating Profit represents income from operations reported as "Income from Continuing Operations" in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP, plus stock-based employee compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, in-process research and development costs and restructuring charges.
 
A summary of the Plan terms follows:
 
                
The Plan is applicable to the Chief Executive Officer and the Executives and based on Company and individual performance.
 
                
Company performance targets are based on ACV, Recognized Revenue and Operating Profit relative to goals.
 
                
Individual plans establish the cash bonus to be awarded to each Executive based upon the level of achievement for ACV, Recognized Revenue, Operating Profit and individual executive performance during 2010.
 
                
Cash bonuses for at-target achievement of ACV, Recognized Revenue, Operating Profit and individual performance for each Executive under the Plan range from 48% to 100% of base salary.
 
                
The Plan is an annual plan and is effective for fiscal year 2010. Any cash bonuses earned will be paid by March 15, 2011.

(a)   The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held each year on a date and at a time designated by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting.  Each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, provided that the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast for the nominees at any meeting for the election of directors where, as of the date that is one day before the date that the corporation first files its definitive proxy statement (regardless of whether or not thereafter revised or supplemented) with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected at the meeting; for purposes of this sentence, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director.

.  In addition, for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder,
such business must be a proper matter for stockholder action pursuant to these bylaws and applicable law.  For the avoidance of doubt, clause (C) above shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to bring business before an annual meeting of stockholders.
 
(i)        
To comply with clause (C) of Section 2.2(b) above, a stockholder's notice must set forth all information required under this Section 2.2(b) and must be timely received by the secretary of the corporation.  To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received by the secretary of the corporation not less than 45 calendar days nor earlier than 75 calendar days before the one-year anniversary of the date on which the corporation first mailed its proxy materials or a notice of availability of proxy materials (whichever is earlier) in connection with the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than thirty (30) days from the date contemplated at the time of the previous year's proxy statement, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the later of one hundred twenty (120) calendar days in advance of such annual meeting or ten (10) calendar days following the date on which Public Announcement (as defined below) of the date of the meeting is first made.

document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor thereto (the "1934 Act").

a statement whether either such stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person will deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the corporation's voting shares required under applicable law to carry the proposal (such information provided and statements made as required by clauses (A) through (H) to constitute a "Business Solicitation Statement").  In addition, to be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the secretary must be supplemented not later than ten days following the record date to disclose the information contained in clauses (C), (D) and (E) above as of the record date. 
A "Stockholder Associated Person" of any stockholder shall mean (A) any person controlling, directly or indirectly, or acting in concert with, such stockholder, (B) any beneficial owner of shares of stock of the corporation owned of record or beneficially by such stockholder and on whose behalf the proposal or nomination, as the case may be, is being made, or (C) any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with such person referred to in the preceding clauses (A) and (B).
 
(iii)      
Without exception,
no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b). 
In addition, business proposed to be brought by a stockholder may not be brought before the annual meeting if such stockholder or a Stockholder Associated Person, as applicable, takes action contrary to the representations made in the Business Solicitation Statement applicable to such business or if the Business Solicitation Statement applicable to such business contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading. 
The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (b), and, if he or she should so determine, he or she shall so declare at the meeting that any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be conducted.
 
(c)

with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.2(c). 
In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination to be made by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the secretary of the corporation.

GENERAL MATTERS
 
8.1         
RECORD DATE FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN NOTICE AND VOTING
 
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action other than as provided for in Article II of these Bylaws, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted and which shall not be more than sixty (60) calendar days before any such action.  In that case, only stockholders of record at the close of business on the date so fixed are entitled to receive the dividend, distribution or allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date so fixed, except as otherwise provided by law.

8.5         
STOCK CERTIFICATES; TRANSFER; PARTLY PAID SHARES
 
The shares of the corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board of Directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares.  Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation.  Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the Board of Directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and, upon request, every holder of uncertificated shares, shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, the chairman or vice-chairman of the Board of Directors, or the president or vice-president, and by the chief financial officer or an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant secretary of such corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form.  Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile.  In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

powers, designations, preferences or other special rights of such stock and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights, if any; a statement or summary of liens, if any; a conspicuous notice of restrictions upon transfer or registration of transfer, if any; a statement as to any applicable voting trust agreement; and if the shares be assessable, or, if assessments are collectible by personal action, a plain statement of such facts.
 
Upon surrender to the secretary or transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.
 
The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor.  Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated.  Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.
 
8.6

8.7         
LOST CERTIFICATES
 
Except as provided in this Section 8.7, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and canceled at the same time.  The Board of Directors may, in case any share certificate or certificate for any other security is lost, stolen or destroyed, authorize the issuance of replacement certificates on such terms and conditions as the board may require; the board may require indemnification of the corporation secured by a bond or other adequate security sufficient to protect the corporation against any claim that may be made against it, including any expense or liability, on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of the certificate or the issuance of the replacement certificate.
 
 
8.8

(ii)           such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the Corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice.

for future distribution under the Plan, except that if unvested Shares of Restricted Stock are repurchased by the Company, such Shares shall become available for future grant under the Plan.
 
           (ii)        Notwithstanding the foregoing and, subject to adjustment provided in Section 13, the maximum number of Shares that may be issued upon the exercise of Incentive Stock Options shall equal the aggregate Share number stated in Section 3(a), plus, to the extent allowable under Section 422 of the Code, any Shares that become available for issuance under the Plan under paragraph (i) above.

Limitations
 
            (i)        Each Option shall be designated in the Award Agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option.  However, notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options.  For purposes of this Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted.  The Fair Market Value of the Shares shall be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.
 
           (ii)        No Participant shall be granted, in any Fiscal Year, Options to purchase more than 1,000,000 Shares.

          (iii)        The foregoing limitations shall be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Company's capitalization as described in Section 13.
 
          (iv)        If an Option is cancelled in the same Fiscal Year of the Company in which it was granted (other than in connection with a transaction described in Section 13), the cancelled Option will be counted against the limits set forth in subsections (i) and (ii) above.  For this purpose, if the exercise price of an Option is reduced, the transaction will be treated as a cancellation of the Option and the grant of a new Option.
 
(b)           .  The term of each Option shall be ten (10) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement.  Moreover, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Incentive Stock

An Option shall be deemed exercised when the Company receives: (i) written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the Award Agreement) from the person entitled to exercise the Option, and (ii) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised.  Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Award Agreement and the Plan.  Shares issued upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in the name of the Participant or, if requested by the Participant, in the name of the Participant and his or her spouse.  Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder shall exist with respect to the Optioned Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option.  The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly after the Option is exercised.  No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 13 of the Plan.
 
Exercising an Option in any manner shall decrease the number of Shares thereafter available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.
 
           (ii)        .  If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider, other than upon the Participant's death or Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement).  In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for three (3) months following the Participant's termination.  If, on the date of termination, the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan.  If, after termination, the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time
Termination of Relationship as a Service Provider
specified by the Administrator, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.
 
          (iii)        .  If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider as a result of the Participant's Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement).  In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Participant's termination.  If, on the date of termination, the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan.  If, after termination, the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.
Disability of Participant
 
          (iv)        .  If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, the Option may be exercised following the Participant's death within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of death (but in no event may the option be exercised later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement), by the Participant's designated beneficiary, provided such beneficiary has been designated prior to Participant's death in a form acceptable to the Administrator.  If no such beneficiary has been designated by the Participant, then such Option may be exercised by the personal representative of the Participant's estate or by the person(s) to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to the Participant's will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution.  In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following Participant's death.  If, at the time of death, Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall immediately revert to the Plan.  If the Option is not so exercised within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.
Death of Participant
 
7.             .
Restricted Stock
 
(a)           .  Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Administrator, at any time and from time to time, may grant Shares of Restricted Stock to Employees, Directors and Consultants in such amounts as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall determine.  The Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine the number of Shares to be granted to each Participant, provided that during any Fiscal Year, no Participant will receive more than an aggregate of 100,000 Shares of Restricted Stock.  Notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, in connection with a Participant's initial service as an Employee, an Employee may be granted an aggregate of up to an additional 250,000 Shares of Restricted Stock.
Grant of Restricted Stock
 
(b)           .  Each Award of Restricted Stock shall be evidenced by a Restricted Stock Agreement that shall specify the Period of Restriction, the number of Shares granted, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall determine.  Unless the Administrator determines otherwise, Shares of Restricted Stock shall be held by the Company as escrow agent until the restrictions on such Shares have lapsed.
Restricted Stock Agreement
(c)           .  Except as provided in this Section 7, Shares of Restricted Stock may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated until the end of the applicable Period of Restriction.
Transferability
 
(d)           .  The Restricted Stock Agreement will contain such other terms, provisions and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be determined by the Administrator.
Other Restrictions
 
            (i)        .  The Administrator may set restrictions based upon the achievement of specific performance objectives (Company-wide, divisional, or individual), applicable federal or state securities laws, or any other basis determined by the Administrator in its discretion.
General Restrictions
 
           (ii)        .  For purposes of qualifying grants of Restricted Stock as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator, in its discretion, may set restrictions based upon the achievement of Performance Goals.  The Performance Goals will be set by the Administrator on or before the latest date permissible to enable the Restricted Stock to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code.  In granting Restricted Stock which is intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator will follow any procedures determined by it from time to time to be necessary or appropriate to ensure qualification of the Restricted Stock under Section 162(m) of the Code (e.g., in determining the Performance Goals).
Section 162(m) Performance Restrictions
 
          (iii)        .  The Administrator, in its discretion, may legend the certificates representing Restricted Stock to give appropriate notice of such restrictions.  For example, the Administrator may determine that some or all certificates representing Shares of Restricted Stock shall bear the following legend:
Legend on Certificates
 
"The sale or other transfer of the shares of stock represented by this certificate, whether voluntary, involuntary, or by operation of law, is subject to certain restrictions on transfer as set forth in the Advent Software, Inc. 2002 Stock Plan, and in a Restricted Stock Agreement.  A copy of the Plan and such Restricted Stock Agreement may be obtained from the Secretary of Advent Software, Inc."
 
(e)           .  Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7, Shares of Restricted Stock covered by each Restricted Stock grant made under the Plan shall be released from escrow as soon as practicable after the last day of the Period of Restriction.  The Administrator, in its discretion, may accelerate the time at which any restrictions shall lapse or be removed.  After the restrictions have lapsed, the Participant shall be entitled to have any legend or legends under Section 7(d)(iii) removed from his or her Share certificate, and the Shares shall be freely transferable by the Participant.
Removal of Restrictions
 
(f)            .  During the Period of Restriction, Participants holding Shares of Restricted Stock granted hereunder may exercise full voting rights with respect to those Shares, unless the Committee determines otherwise.
Voting Rights
(g)           .  During the Period of Restriction, Participants holding Shares of Restricted Stock shall be entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to such Shares unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement.  If any such dividends or distributions are paid in Shares, the Shares shall be subject to the same restrictions on transferability and forfeitability as the Shares of Restricted Stock with respect to which they were paid.
Dividends and Other Distributions
 
(h)           .  On the date set forth in the Award Agreement, the Restricted Stock for which restrictions have not lapsed shall revert to the Company and again shall become available for grant under the Plan.
Return of Restricted Stock to Company
 
8.             .
Stock Appreciation Rights
 
(a)           .  Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, a SAR may be granted to Service Providers at any time and from time to time as will be determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion.  The Administrator may grant Affiliated SARs, Freestanding SARs, Tandem SARs, or any combination thereof.
Grant of SARs
 
(b)           .  The Administrator will have complete discretion to determine the number of SARs granted to any Service Provider, provided that during any Fiscal Year, no Participant will be granted SARs covering more than 1,000,000 Shares.  Notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, in connection with a Participant's initial service as an Employee, an Employee may be granted SARs covering up to an additional 1,000,000 Shares.
Number of Shares
 
(c)           .  The Administrator, subject to the provisions of the Plan, will have complete discretion to determine the terms and conditions of SARs granted under the Plan.  However, the exercise price of a Freestanding SAR will not be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the grant date.  The exercise price of Tandem or Affiliated SARs will equal the exercise price of the related Option.
Exercise Price and Other Terms
 
(d)           .  Tandem SARs may be exercised for all or part of the Shares subject to the related Option upon the surrender of the right to exercise the equivalent portion of the related Option.  A Tandem SAR may be exercised only with respect to the Shares for which its related Option is then exercisable.  With respect to a Tandem SAR granted in connection with an Incentive Stock Option: (a) the Tandem SAR will expire no later than the expiration of the underlying Incentive Stock Option; (b) the value of the payout with respect to the Tandem SAR will be for no more than one hundred percent (100%) of the difference between the exercise price of the underlying Incentive Stock Option and the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the underlying Incentive Stock Option at the time the Tandem SAR is exercised; and (c) the Tandem SAR will be exercisable only when the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the Incentive Stock Option exceeds the Exercise Price of the Incentive Stock Option.
Exercise of Tandem SARs
 
(e)           .  An Affiliated SAR will be deemed to be exercised upon the exercise of the related Option.  The deemed exercise of an Affiliated SAR will not necessitate a reduction in the number of Shares subject to the related Option.
Exercise of Affiliated SARs
(f)            .  Freestanding SARs will be exercisable on such terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine.
Exercise of Freestanding SARs
 
(g)           .  Each SAR grant will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the exercise price, the term of the SAR, the conditions of exercise, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine.
SAR Agreement
 
(h)           .  An SAR granted under the Plan will expire upon the date determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion, and set forth in the Award Agreement, but not later than ten (10) years from the date of grant.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rules of Section 6(d)(ii), 6(d)(iii) and 6(d)(iv) also will apply to SARs.
Expiration of SARs
 
(i)            .  Upon exercise of an SAR, a Participant will be entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount determined by multiplying:
Payment of SAR Amount
 
            (i)        The difference between the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise over the exercise price; times
 
           (ii)        The number of Shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised.  At the discretion of the Administrator, the payment upon SAR exercise may be in cash, in Shares of equivalent value, or in some combination thereof.  Unless the Administrator determines otherwise, SARs for which payment upon exercise is made in cash will comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder.
 
9.             .
Performance Units and Performance Shares
 
(a)           .  Performance Units and Performance Shares may be granted to Service Providers at any time and from time to time, as will be determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion.  The Administrator will have complete discretion in determining the number of Performance Units and Performance Shares granted to each Participant, provided that during any Fiscal Year, (a) no Participant will receive Performance Units having an initial value greater than $2,000,000 and (b) no Participant will receive more than 100,000 Performance Shares.  Notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, in connection with a Participant's initial service as an Employee, an Employee may be granted up to an additional 250,000 Performance Shares.
Grant of Performance Units/Shares
 
(b)           .  Each Performance Unit will have an initial value that is established by the Administrator on or before the date of grant.  Each Performance Share will have an initial value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant.
Value of Performance Units/Shares
 
(c)           .  The Administrator will set performance objectives in its discretion which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number or value of Performance Units/Shares that will be paid out to the Participants.  The time period during which the performance objectives must be met will be called the "Performance Period." Each Award of Performance Units/Shares will be evidenced by an Award
Performance Objectives and Other Terms
Agreement that will specify the Performance Period, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine.
 
            (i)        .  The Administrator may set performance objectives based upon the achievement of Company-wide, divisional, or individual goals, applicable federal or state securities laws, or any other basis determined by the Administrator in its discretion.
General Performance Objectives
 
           (ii)        .  For purposes of qualifying grants of Performance Units/Shares as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee, in its discretion, may determine that the performance objectives applicable to Performance Units/Shares will be based on the achievement of Performance Goals.  The Performance Goals will be set by the Committee on or before the latest date permissible to enable the Performance Units/Shares to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code.  In granting Performance Units/Shares which are intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee will follow any procedures determined by it from time to time to be necessary or appropriate to ensure qualification of the Performance Units/Shares under Section 162(m) of the Code (e.g., in determining the Performance Goals).
Section 162(m) Performance Objectives
 
(d)           .  After the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Performance Units/Shares will be entitled to receive a payout of the number of Performance Units/Shares earned by the Participant over the Performance Period, to be determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding performance objectives or other vesting provisions have been achieved.  After the grant of a Performance Unit/Share, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any performance objectives or other vesting provisions for such Performance Unit/Share.
Earning of Performance Units/Shares
 
(e)           .  Payment of earned Performance Units/Shares will be made as soon as practicable after the expiration of the applicable Performance Period.  The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may pay earned Performance Units/Shares in the form of cash, in Shares (which have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the value of the earned Performance Units/Shares at the close of the applicable Performance Period) or in a combination thereof.
Form and Timing of Payment of Performance Units/Shares
 
(f)            .  On the date set forth in the Award Agreement, all unearned or unvested Performance Units/Shares will be forfeited to the Company, and again will be available for grant under the Plan.
Cancellation of Performance Units/Shares
 
10.           .  Restricted Stock Units shall consist of Restricted Stock, Performance Share or Performance Unit Awards that the Administrator, in its sole discretion permits to be paid out in installments or on a deferred basis, in accordance with rules and procedures established by the Administrator.  Awards may be paid out to Participants in the form of cash or Shares at the Administrator's discretion.  The Administrator will have complete discretion in determining the number of Restricted Stock Units granted to each Participant, provided that during any Fiscal Year, (a) no Participant will receive more than 100,000 Restricted Stock Units. 
Restricted Stock Units
Notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, in connection with a Participant's initial service as an Employee, the Participant may be granted up to an additional 250,000 Restricted Stock Units.
 
11.           .  Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, Awards may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Participant, only by the Participant.  If the Administrator makes an Award transferable, such Award shall contain such additional terms and conditions as the Administrator deems appropriate.  Options may not be transferred to a third party for consideration without the approval of Company stockholders.
Transferability of Awards
 
12.           .  Unless the Administrator provides otherwise, vesting of Awards granted hereunder will be suspended during any unpaid leave of absence.  A Service Provider will not cease to be an Employee in the case of (i) any leave of absence approved by the Company or (ii) transfers between locations of the Company or between the Company, its Parent, or any Subsidiary.  For purposes of Incentive Stock Options, no such leave may exceed ninety (90) days, unless reemployment upon expiration of such leave is guaranteed by statute or contract.  If reemployment upon expiration of a leave of absence approved by the Company is not so guaranteed, then three (3) months following the 91st day of such leave any Incentive Stock Option held by the participant will cease to be treated as an Incentive Stock Option and will be treated for tax purposes as a Nonstatutory Stock Option.
Leaves of Absence
 
13.           .
Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization, Merger or Change in Control
 
(a)           .  Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company, the number of shares of Common Stock that have been authorized for issuance under the Plan but as to which no Awards have yet been granted or which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration of an Award, the number of shares of Common Stock as well as the price per share of Common Stock covered by each such outstanding Award, and the numerical Share limits in Sections 3, 6, 7(a), 8(b), 9(a) and 10 shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Common Stock, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration." Such adjustment shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive.  Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of Common Stock subject to an Award.
Changes in Capitalization
 
(b)           .  In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator shall notify each Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction.  The Administrator in its discretion may provide for a Participant to have the right to exercise his or her Award until ten (10) days prior to such transaction as to all of the Optioned Stock covered thereby, including Shares as to which the
Dissolution or Liquidation
 
 
Award would not otherwise be exercisable.  In addition, the Administrator may provide that any Company repurchase option applicable to any Restricted Stock shall lapse as to all such Shares, provided the proposed dissolution or liquidation takes place at the time and in the manner contemplated.  To the extent it has not been previously exercised, an Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action.
 
(c)           .  In the event of a merger of the Company with or into another corporation, or a Change in Control, each outstanding Award shall be assumed or an equivalent option or right substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation.
Merger or Change in Control
 
In the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Award, the Participant shall fully vest in and have the right to exercise his or her Options or Stock Appreciation Right as to all of the Optioned Stock, including Shares as to which such Awards would not otherwise be vested or exercisable.  All restrictions on Restricted Stock and, with respect to Performance Shares and Performance Units, all Performance Goals or other vesting criteria will be as determined by the Board.  In addition, if an Option or Stock Appreciation Right becomes fully vested and exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a Change in Control, the Administrator shall notify the Participant in writing or electronically that the Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall be fully vested and exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and the Option or Stock Purchase Right shall terminate upon the expiration of such period.
 
For the purposes of this subsection (c), an Award shall be considered assumed if, following the merger or Change in Control, the Award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the merger or Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) or, in the case of a Stock Appreciation Right upon the exercise of which the Administrator determines to pay cash or a Performance Share or Performance Unit which the Administrator can determine to pay in cash, the fair market value of the consideration received in the Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the merger or Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right or upon the payout of a Performance Share or Performance Unit, for each Share subject to such Award (or in the case of Performance Units, the number of implied shares determined by dividing the value of the Performance Units by the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control), to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or Change in Control.
 
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 13(c) to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more Performance Goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such Performance Goals without the Participant's consent; provided, however, a modification to such Performance Goals only to reflect the successor
corporation's post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.
 
14.           .  Neither the Plan nor any Award shall confer upon a Participant any right with respect to continuing the Participant's relationship as a Service Provider with the Company, nor shall they interfere in any way with the Participant's right or the Company's right to terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause.
No Effect on Employment or Service
 
15.           .  The date of grant of an Award shall be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the determination granting such Award, or such other later date as is determined by the Administrator.  Notice of the determination shall be provided to each Participant within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.
Date of Grant
 
16.           .  Subject to Section 21 of the Plan, the amended and restated
Term of Plan
Plan shall become effective upon the date, in 2010, of its adoption by the Board.  It shall continue in effect until 12 February, 2017, unless terminated earlier under Section 17 of the Plan.
 
17.           .
Amendment and Termination of the Plan
 
(a)           .  The Board may at any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan.
Amendment and Termination
 
(b)           .  The Company shall obtain stockholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with Applicable Laws.
Stockholder Approval
 
(c)           .  No amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan shall impair the rights of any Participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Participant and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Participant and the Company.  Termination of the Plan shall not affect the Administrator's ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Options granted under the Plan prior to the date of such termination.
Effect of Amendment or Termination
 
18.           .
Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares
 
(a)           .  Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with Applicable Laws and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
Legal Compliance
 
(b)           .  As a condition to the exercise of an Award, the Company may require the person exercising such Award to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required.
Investment Representations
 
19.           .  The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be
Inability to Obtain Authority
necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.
 
20.           .  The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.
Reservation of Shares
 
21.           .  The Plan shall be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is adopted.  Such stockholder approval shall be obtained in the manner and to the degree required under Applicable Laws.
Stockholder Approval

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 3.2
1.1         
REGISTERED OFFICE
 
The registered office of the corporation shall be in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, State of Delaware.  The name of the registered agent of the corporation at such location is The Corporation Trust Company.

OTHER OFFICES
 
The Board of Directors may at any time establish branch or subordinate offices at any place or places where the corporation is qualified to do business.
 
2.1         
PLACE OF MEETINGS
 
Meetings of stockholders shall be held at any place within or outside the State of Delaware as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting or in a duly executed waiver of notice thereof.  The Board of Directors may determine that a meeting shall not be held at any specific place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication as authorized in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.  In the absence of any such designation, stockholders' meetings shall be held at the principal executive office of the corporation.
 
2.2         
ANNUAL MEETING
 
(a)           The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held each year on a date and at a time designated by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting.  Each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, provided that the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast for the nominees at any meeting for the election of directors where, as of the date that is one day before the date that the corporation first files its definitive proxy statement (regardless of whether or not thereafter revised or supplemented) with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected at the meeting; for purposes of this sentenc e, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director.
 
(b)           At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting.  To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be: (A) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (B) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (C)  brought by a stockholder of the corporation who (1) is a stockholder of record at the time of the giving of the notice required by this Section 2.2(b) and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting and (2) has timely complied in proper written form with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2. 2(b).  In addition, for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, such business must be a proper matter for stockholder action pursuant to these bylaws and applicable law.  For the avoidance of doubt, clause (C) above shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to bring business before an annual meeting of stockholders.
 
(i)           
To comply with clause (C) of Section 2.2(b) above, a stockholder's notice must set forth all information required under this Section 2.2(b) and must be timely received by the secretary of the corporation.  To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received by the secretary of the corporation not less than 45 calendar days nor earlier than 75 calendar days before the one-year anniversary of the date on which the corporation first mailed its proxy materials or a notice of availability of proxy materials (whichever is earlier) in connection with the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the an nual meeting has been changed by more than thirty (30) days from the date contemplated at the time of the previous year's proxy statement, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the later of one hundred twenty (120) calendar days in advance of such annual meeting or ten (10) calendar days following the date on which Public Announcement (as defined below) of the date of the meeting is first made.  In no event shall an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.  "Public Announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones New Service, Associated Press or a comparable national news service or in a
document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor thereto (the "1934 Act").
 
(ii)           To be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the secretary shall set forth as to each matter of business the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting: (A) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (B) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation's books, of the stockholder proposing such business and any Stockholder Associated Person (as defined below), (C) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person and a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the corporation entitled to vote at such meeting, (D) any derivative positions held or benef icially held by the stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person, (E) whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of such stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person with respect to any securities of the corporation, and a description of any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares), the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, or to manage the risk or benefit from share price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of, such stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person with respect to any securities of the corporation, (F) any material interest of the stockholder or a Stockholder Associated Person in such business, (G) any other information relating to such stockholder or Stockholder Associated Person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the proposal pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act, and (H)  a statement whether either such stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person will deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the corporation's voting shares required under applicable law to carry the proposal (such information provided and statements made as required by clauses (A) through (H) to constitute a "Business Solicitation Statement").  In addition, to be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the secretary must be supplemented not later than ten days following the record date to disclose the information contained in clauses (C), (D) and (E) above as of the record date.  A "Stockholder Associated Person" of any stockholder shall mean (A) any person controlling, directly or indirectly, or acting in concert with, such stockholder, (B) any beneficial owner of shares of stock of the corporation owned of record or beneficially by such stockholder and on whose behalf the proposal or nomination, as the case may be, is being made, or (C) any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with such person referred to in the preceding clauses (A) and (B).
 
(iii)          Without exception, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b).  In addition, business proposed to be brought by a stockholder may not be brought before the annual meeting if such stockholder or a Stockholder Associated Person, as applicable, takes action contrary to the representations made in the Business Solicitation Statement applicable to such business or if the Business Solicitation Statement applicable to such business contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not
 
misleading.  The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (b), and, if he or she should so determine, he or she shall so declare at the meeting that any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be conducted.
(c)
                                 
Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the contrary, only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.2(c) shall be eligible for election as directors.

In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination to be made by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the secretary of the corporation.

STOCK CERTIFICATES; TRANSFER; PARTLY PAID SHARES
 
The shares of the corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board of Directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares.  Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation.  Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the Board of Directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and, upon request, every holder of uncertificated shares, shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, the chairman or vice-chairman of the Board of Directors, or the president or vice-president, and by the chief financial officer or an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant secretary of such corporation representin g the number of shares registered in certificate form.  Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile.  In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
 
Certificates for shares shall be of such form and device as the Board of Directors may designate and shall state the name of the record holder of the shares represented thereby; its number; date of issuance; the number of shares for which it is issued; a summary statement or reference to the powers, designations, preferences or other special rights of such stock and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights, if any; a statement or summary of liens, if any; a conspicuous notice of restrictions upon transfer or registration of transfer, if any; a statement as to any applicable voting trust agreement; and if the shares be assessable, or, if assessments are collectible by personal action, a plain statement of such facts.
 
Upon surrender to the secretary or transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.
 
The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor.  Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated.  Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.
 
8.6
                              
SPECIAL DESIGNATION ON CERTIFICATES

the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to transfers of stock, stock certificates and uncertificated stock), in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
 
8.7
                              
LOST CERTIFICATES
 
Except as provided in this Section 8.7, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and canceled at the same time.  The Board of Directors may, in case any share certificate or certificate for any other security is lost, stolen or destroyed, authorize the issuance of replacement certificates on such terms and conditions as the board may require; the board may require indemnification of the corporation secured by a bond or other adequate security sufficient to protect the corporation against any claim that may be made against it, including any expense or liability, on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of the certificate or the issuance of the replacement certificate.
 
8.8
                              
TRANSFER AGENTS AND REGISTRARS
 
The Board of Directors may appoint one or more transfer agents or transfer clerks, and one or more registrars, each of which shall be an incorporated bank or trust company  either domestic or foreign, who shall be appointed at such times and places as the requirements of the corporation may necessitate and the Board of Directors may designate.

8.11
                       
PROVISIONS CONTRARY TO PROVISIONS OF LAW
 
Any article, section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause or phrase of these Bylaws which upon being construed in the manner provided in Section 8.11 hereof, shall be contrary to or inconsistent with any applicable provisions of law, shall not apply so long as said provisions of law shall remain in effect, but such result shall not affect the validity or applicability of any other portions of these Bylaws, it being hereby declared that these Bylaws would have been adopted and each article, section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more articles, sections, subsections, subdivisions, sentences, clauses or phrases is or are illegal.

Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders pursuant to the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given.  Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Corporation.  Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if:
 
(i)
                                    
the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent; and
 
(ii)
                                 
such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the Corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice.
 
However, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.
Any notice given pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be deemed given:
 
(i)
                                    
if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice;
 
(ii)
                                 
if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice;
 
(iii)
                              
if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and
 
(iv)
                             
if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder.
 
An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the Corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
 
9.2
                              
DEFINITION OF ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION
 
An "electronic transmission" means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved, and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.
 
9.3
                              
INAPPLICABILITY
 
Notice by a form of electronic transmission shall not apply to Section 164 (relating to failure to pay for stock; remedies), Section 296 (relating to adjudication of claims; appeal), Section 311 (relating to revocation of voluntary dissolution), Section 312 (relating to renewal, revival, extension and restoration of certificate of incorporation) or Section 324 (relating to attachment of shares of stock or any option, right or interest therein) of the DGCL.
 
Subject to Section 6.7 hereof, the original or other Bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed at any annual or special meeting of stockholders, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat.  The corporation may, in its Certificate of Incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws upon the Board of Directors.  The fact that such power has been so
conferred upon the Board of Directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws.
 
Whenever an amendment or new bylaw is adopted, it shall be copied in the book of Bylaws with the original Bylaws, in the appropriate place.  If any bylaw is repealed, the fact of repeal with the date of the meeting at which the repeal was enacted or the filing of the operative written consent(s) shall be stated in said

The Securityholders' Representative hereby authorizes the Escrow Agent to deliver cash from the Escrow Fund equal to the amount of Losses claimed in any Officer's Certificate in respect of any Agreed-Upon Loss upon receipt of such Officer's Certificate without regard to the 30-day period set forth in this

(ii)
                                                   
If the Securityholders' Representative (or the Indemnifying Party(s), in the event that indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from such Indemnifying Party(s)) does not object in writing (as provided in
Section 7.6(b)(i)
) to the claims contained in an Officer's Certificate prior to the Objection Deadline for such Officer's Certificate, such failure to object shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by the Securityholders' Representative and the Indemnifying Party(s) that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of the claims for Losses set forth in such Officer's Certificate (and such entitlement shall be conclusively and irrefutably established).

(i)
                                                      
In the event that the Securityholders' Representative delivers an Objection Notice in accordance with
Section 7.6(b)
(other than in connection with Agreed-Upon Losses for which the Securityholders' Representative has waived the right to object), the Securityholders' Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each such claim.  If the Securityholders' Representative and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of a claim against the Escrow Fund, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent.  The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.
 
(ii)
                                                   
If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation and prior to 30 days after delivery of an Objection Notice, either Parent or the Securityholders' Representative may demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the Loss that is at issue is the subject of pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration, and in either such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by one arbitrator mutually agreeable to Parent and the Securityholders' Representative.  In the event that, within 30 days after submission of any dispute to arbitration, Parent and the Securityholders' Representative cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator, then, within 15 days after the end of such 30 day period, Parent and the Securityholders' Representative shall each select one arbitrator.  The two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator.  If the Securityholders' Representative fails to select an arbitrator during such 15 day period, then the parties agree that the arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator selected by Parent.
 
(iii)
                                                
Any such arbitration shall be held in New York, New York, under the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS/Endispute ("
JAMS
").  The arbitrator(s) shall determine how all expenses relating to the arbitration shall be paid, including the respective expenses of each party, the fees of each arbitrator and the administrative fee of JAMS.  The arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator or majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject matter of the dispute.  The arbitrator, or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys' fees and costs, to the same extent as a competent court of law or equity, should the arbitrators or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification.  The decision of the arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Officer's Certificate shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement and the Indemnifying Parties.  Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions that shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator(s), and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on, and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with, the terms of such award, judgment, decree or order.  Within 30 days of a decision of the arbitrator(s) requiring payment by one party to another, such party shall make the payment to such other party, including any distributions out of the Escrow Fund, as applicable.
 
(iv)
                                               
Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.  Except as set forth in

Third-Party Claim
") that Parent reasonably believes may result in a demand against the Escrow Fund or for other indemnification pursuant to this , Parent shall notify the Securityholders' Representative of such claim, and the Securityholders' Representative shall be entitled, on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties, at their expense, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of such Third-Party Claim.  Parent shall act in good faith and will consult as reasonable with the Securityholder's Representative and deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Securityholders' Representative copies of all material correspondence, pleadings, motions, briefs, or appeals relating to or submitted in connection with the defense of any such Third Party Claim, and notices of any hearing or other court proceeding relating to such Third Party Claim in each case to the extent that receipt of such documents or consultation does not affect any privilege relating to any Indemnified Party and to the extent reasonably practicable.  Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of, and to settle, any such claim; , , that except with the consent of the Securityholders' Representative, no settlement of any such Third-Party Claim with third party claimants shall be determinative of the amount of Losses relating to such matter.  In the event that the Securityholders' Representative has consented to any such settlement, the Indemnifying Parties shall have no power or authority to object under any provision of this to the amount of any Third-Party Claim by Parent against the Escrow Fund, or against the Indemnifying Parties directly, as the case may be, with respect to such settlement.  If there is a Third-Party Claim that, if adversely determined would give rise to a right of recovery for Losses hereunder, then any amounts incurred or accrued by the Indemnified Parties in defense or settlement of such Third-Party Claim, regardless of the outcome of such claim, shall be deemed Losses hereunder.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this

SAN FRANCISCO and JACKSONVILLE
  Advent Software, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADVS), a leading provider of software and services for the investment management industry, has signed a definitive agreement to purchase Black Diamond Performance Reporting LLC ("Black Diamond"), a leading provider of web-based, outsourced portfolio management and reporting platforms for independent advisors.
May 12, 2011
 
"Advent's acquisition of Black Diamond will accelerate our combined ability to help advisors succeed by giving them an innovative, purpose-built platform so they can grow their practices and delight their clients," said Advent's Founder and CEO Stephanie DiMarco.  "Advent is passionate about helping our clients to be great, and we share that passion with Black Diamond  we are excited about their commitment to advisors' success and vision for their clients.  Black Diamond has a well-earned reputation for innovation and client focus, and I am thrilled to have them join the Advent team."
 
"I'm excited about joining forces with Advent.  We are both driven by providing the best solutions for our clients," said Black Diamond's Founder and CEO Reed Colley.  "Black Diamond now gains access to resources to accelerate both our product development and growth.  The combination of Black Diamond and Advent is a great mix of our focused, innovative solutions with one of the most trusted pioneers in investment management technology.  Together, I am confident we will continue to redefine how advisors use technology to grow their practices and achieve great results for their clients."
 
Organizational Focus on Client Opportunities
 
After the transaction is complete, which is expected to occur in the next several weeks, Black Diamond and its existing management team will lead the advisory strategy for Advent, operating as an independent business group within the Company.  Reed Colley, Black Diamond's Founder and CEO, will become General Manager of the Black Diamond group, reporting to Peter Hess, Advent's President.
 
With the acquisition of Black Diamond, Advent will have three business groups chartered with delivering value to distinct segments of the investment management industry: domestic advisors; asset managers; and hedge funds and alternative managers.  The Company will continue to invest in and evolve the Black Diamond platform, as well as its Advent Portfolio Exchange (APX), Moxy, Advent OnDemand, Axys, and Geneva platforms, with each serving distinct client segments.
 
"Advent is committed to being the most innovative, responsive and reliable partner to the investment management industry," said Advent's Mr. Hess.  "We understand one size doesn't fit all' when it comes to addressing the diverse and evolving needs of the industry, and that's why our multiple-platform strategy has been so successful.  Together, we believe Advent and Black Diamond can be even better, faster, and stronger, and we're proud to add this powerful new alternative for advisors to our family of purpose-built solutions."

Terms and Effect of Agreement
 
Under the terms of the agreement, Advent will pay approximately $73 million for all of the outstanding ownership units of Black Diamond, subject to adjustment for third-party expenses and certain other specified items.  The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2011.
 
Black Diamond has grown revenues over 40% per year over the last two years.  Upon closing, the Company expects Black Diamond to contribute just under $1 million per month of recurring revenues.  Advent expects the acquisition to be neutral to non-GAAP earnings per share in 2011 and slightly accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share in 2012 (Non-GAAP earnings exclude amortization of purchased intangibles and stock compensation expense).  The acquisition will be dilutive to GAAP earnings per share in both 2011 and 2012.
 
After closing, in connection with the Company's second quarter earnings announcement conference call, Advent will provide updated guidance for 2011 revenues, operating margin and operating cash flows.

Dated: September 9, 2011

Exhibit 3.1
 
1.1
         
REGISTERED OFFICE
 
The registered office of the corporation shall be in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, State of Delaware.  The name of the registered agent of the corporation at such location is The Corporation Trust Company.

OTHER OFFICES
 
The Board of Directors may at any time establish branch or subordinate offices at any place or places where the corporation is qualified to do business.
 
2.1
         
PLACE OF MEETINGS
 
Meetings of stockholders shall be held at any place within or outside the State of Delaware as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting or in a duly executed waiver of notice thereof.  The Board of Directors may determine that a meeting shall not be held at any specific place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication as authorized in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.  In the absence of any such designation, stockholders' meetings shall be held at the principal executive office of the corporation.
2.2
         
ANNUAL MEETING
 
(a)
          
The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held each year on a date and at a time designated by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting.  Each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, provided that the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast for the nominees at any meeting for the election of directors where, as of the date that is one day before the date that the corporation first files its definitive proxy statement (regardless of whether or not thereafter revised or supplemented) with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected at the meeting; for purposes of this sentence, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director.
 
(b)
          
At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting.  To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be: (A) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (B) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (C)  brought by a stockholder of the corporation who (1) is a stockholder of record at the time of the giving of the notice required by this Section 2.2(b) and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting and (2) has timely complied in proper written form with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.2(b).  In addition, for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, such business must be a proper matter for stockholder action pursuant to these bylaws and applicable law.  For the avoidance of doubt, clause (C) above shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to bring business before an annual meeting of stockholders.
 
(i)
           
To comply with clause (C) of Section 2.2(b) above, a stockholder's notice must set forth all information required under this Section 2.2(b) and must be timely received by the secretary of the corporation.  To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received by the secretary of the corporation not less than 45 calendar days nor earlier than 75 calendar days before the one-year anniversary of the date on which the corporation first mailed its proxy materials or a notice of availability of proxy materials (whichever is earlier) in connection with the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than thirty (30) days from the date contemplated at the time of the previous year's proxy statement, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the later of one hundred twenty (120) calendar days in advance of such annual meeting or ten (10) calendar days following the date on which Public Announcement (as defined below) of the date of the meeting is first made.  In no event shall an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.  "Public Announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones New Service, Associated Press or a comparable national news service or in a
document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor thereto (the "1934 Act").
 
(ii)
          
To be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the secretary shall set forth as to each matter of business the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting: (A) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (B) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation's books, of the stockholder proposing such business and any Stockholder Associated Person (as defined below), (C) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person and a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the corporation entitled to vote at such meeting, (D) any derivative positions held or beneficially held by the stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person, (E) whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of such stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person with respect to any securities of the corporation, and a description of any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares), the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, or to manage the risk or benefit from share price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of, such stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person with respect to any securities of the corporation, (F) any material interest of the stockholder or a Stockholder Associated Person in such business, (G) any other information relating to such stockholder or Stockholder Associated Person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the proposal pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act, and (H)  a statement whether either such stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person will deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the corporation's voting shares required under applicable law to carry the proposal (such information provided and statements made as required by clauses (A) through (H) to constitute a "Business Solicitation Statement").  In addition, to be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the secretary must be supplemented not later than ten days following the record date to disclose the information contained in clauses (C), (D) and (E) above as of the record date.  A "Stockholder Associated Person" of any stockholder shall mean (A) any person controlling, directly or indirectly, or acting in concert with, such stockholder, (B) any beneficial owner of shares of stock of the corporation owned of record or beneficially by such stockholder and on whose behalf the proposal or nomination, as the case may be, is being made, or (C) any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with such person referred to in the preceding clauses (A) and (B).
 
(iii)
         
Without exception, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b).  In addition, business proposed to be brought by a stockholder may not be brought before the annual meeting if such stockholder or a Stockholder Associated Person, as applicable, takes action contrary to the representations made in the Business Solicitation Statement applicable to such business or if the Business Solicitation Statement applicable to such business contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading.  The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (b), and, if he or she should so determine, he or she shall so declare at the meeting that any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be conducted.
 
(c)
          
Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the contrary, only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.2(c) shall be eligible for election as directors.  Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the corporation may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders only (A) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (B) by a stockholder of the corporation who (1) was a stockholder of record at the time of the giving of the notice required by this Section 2.2(c) and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting and (2) has complied with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.2(c).  In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination to be made by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the secretary of the corporation.

To comply with clause (B) of Section 2.2(c) above, a nomination to be made by a stockholder must set forth all information required under this Section 2.2(c) and must be received by the secretary of the corporation at the principal executive offices of the corporation at the time set forth in, and in accordance with, the final three sentences of Section 2.2(b)(i) above.
 
(ii)
          
To be in proper written form, such stockholder's notice shall set forth:
 
1)
            
as to each person (a "nominee"), whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director:  (A) the name, age, business address and residence address of such nominee, (B) the principal occupation or employment of such nominee, (C) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by such nominee and any derivative positions held or beneficially held by such nominee, (D) whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of such nominee with respect to any securities of the corporation, and a description of any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares), the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, or to manage the risk or benefit of share price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of, such nominee with respect to any securities of the corporation, (E) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nominations are to be made by the stockholder, (F) a written statement executed by the nominee acknowledging that as a director of the corporation, the nominee will owe a fiduciary duty under Delaware law with respect to the corporation and its stockholders, (G) any other information relating to such nominee that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for elections of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to the proxy rules of the 1934 Act (including without limitation such nominee's written consent to being named in the proxy statement, if any, as a nominee and to serving as a
director if elected), and (H) a written statement from each proposed nominee as to whether such proposed nominee, if elected, intends to tender, promptly following such proposed nominee's election or re-election, an irrevocable resignation effective upon such proposed nominee's failure to receive the required vote for re-election at any meeting at which such proposed nominee would face re-election and upon acceptance of such resignation by the Board of Directors, in accordance with the corporation's Policy of the Board of Directors on Director Elections; and
 
2)
            
as to such stockholder giving notice, (A) the information required to be provided pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 2.2 (except that references therein to proposals of business shall instead refer to nominations of directors for purposes of this Section 2.2(c)), and (B) a statement whether either such stockholder or Stockholder Associated Person will deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of a number of the corporation's voting shares reasonably believed by such stockholder or Stockholder Associated Person to be necessary to elect such nominee(s) (such information provided and statements made as required by clauses (A) and (B) above shall constitute a "Nominee Solicitation Statement").
 
3)
            
At the request of the Board of Directors, any person nominated by a stockholder for election as a director shall furnish to the secretary of the corporation (A) that information required to be set forth in the stockholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee as of a date subsequent to the date on which the notice of such person's nomination was given, (B) such other information as may reasonably be required by the corporation to determine the eligibility of such person to serve as a director of the corporation or that could be material to a reasonable stockholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee and (C) a written statement from such proposed nominee as to whether such proposed nominee, if elected, intends to tender, promptly following such proposed nominee's election or re-election, an irrevocable resignation effective upon such proposed nominee's failure to receive the required vote for re-election at any meeting at which such proposed nominee would face re-election and upon acceptance of such resignation by the Board of Directors, in accordance with the corporation's Policy of the Board of Directors on Director Elections; in the absence of the furnishing of such information or statement if requested, such stockholder's nomination shall not be considered in proper form pursuant to this Section 2.2.

Without exception, no person shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation at an annual meeting of stockholders unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.2(c).  In addition, a nominee shall not be eligible for election or re-election if a stockholder or Stockholder Associated Person, as applicable, takes action contrary to the representations made in the Nominee Solicitation Statement applicable to such nominee or if the Nominee Solicitation Statement applicable to such nominee contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.  The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these Bylaws, and if he or she should so determine, he or she shall so declare at the meeting, and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.

Nothing in this Section 2.2 shall be deemed to affect any right of the corporation to omit a proposal from the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 (or any successor provision) under the 1934 Act.

For a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to Section 2.3(a) and (b), nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors shall be made only (1) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (2) by any stockholder of the corporation who (A) is a stockholder of record at the time of the giving of the notice required by this Section 2.3(c) and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting and (B) delivers a timely written notice of the nomination to the secretary of the corporation that includes the information set forth in Section 2.2(c)(ii) above.

In addition, a nominee shall not be eligible for election or re-election if a stockholder or Stockholder Associated
Person, as applicable, takes action contrary to the representations made in the Nominee Solicitation Statement applicable to such nominee or if the Nominee Solicitation Statement applicable to such nominee contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of the laws of the State of Delaware or of the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of the question.
 
If a quorum is initially present, the stockholders may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken is approved by a majority of the stockholders initially constituting the quorum.
 
2.7

At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting.

2.9
         
VALIDATION OF MEETINGS; WAIVER OF NOTICE; CONSENT
 
The transactions of any meeting of stockholders, either annual or special, however called and noticed, and wherever held, shall be as valid as though they had been taken at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum be present either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, each person entitled to vote, who was not present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to the holding of the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof.

Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article VI shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.

INDEMNIFICATION OF OTHERS
 
The corporation shall have the power, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended, to indemnify any person (other than directors and officers, as such terms are defined in Section 6.1 above) against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, or proceeding, in which such person was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party by reason of the fact that such person is or was an employee or agent of the corporation.  For purposes of this Section 6.2, an "employee" or "agent" of the corporation (other than a director or officer, as such terms are defined in Section 6.1 above) shall mean any person (i) who is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was an employee or agent of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.

EXPENSES
 
The corporation shall advance to any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, Corporate Officer or Administrative Officer of the corporation, prior to the final disposition of the proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all expenses incurred by any such director or officer in connection with such proceeding, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay said amounts if it should be determined ultimately that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under these Bylaws or otherwise; provided, however, that the corporation shall not be required to advance expenses to any such director or officer in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless the proceeding was authorized in advance by the Board of Directors of the corporation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to Section 6.5, no advance shall be made by the corporation to a director, Corporate Officer or Administrative Officer of the corporation
or other person entitled to indemnification pursuant to these bylaws
(except by reason of the fact that such officer is or was a director of the corporation in which event this paragraph shall not apply) in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the proceeding, or (ii) if such quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.
 
6.5

6.7

A proper purpose shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a stockholder.  In every instance where an attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the right to inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act on behalf of the stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the corporation at its registered office in Delaware or at its principal place of business.

8.1
         
RECORD DATE FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN NOTICE AND VOTING
 
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action other than as provided for in Article II of these Bylaws, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted and which shall not be more than sixty (60) calendar days before any such action.  In that case, only stockholders of record at the close of business on the date so fixed are entitled to receive the dividend, distribution or allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date so fixed, except as otherwise provided by law.
 
If the Board of Directors does not so fix a record date, then the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the applicable resolution.
 
8.2

From time to time, the Board of Directors shall determine by resolution which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness that are issued in the name of or payable to the corporation, and only the persons so authorized shall sign or endorse those instruments.

8.4
         
CORPORATE CONTRACTS AND INSTRUMENTS:  HOW EXECUTED
 
The Board of Directors, except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws, may authorize and empower any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation; such power and authority may be general or confined to specific instances.  Unless so authorized or ratified by the Board of Directors or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.
8.5
         
STOCK CERTIFICATES; TRANSFER; PARTLY PAID SHARES
 
The shares of the corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board of Directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares.  Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation.  Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the Board of Directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and, upon request, every holder of uncertificated shares, shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, the chairman or vice-chairman of the Board of Directors, or the president or vice-president, and by the chief financial officer or an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant secretary of such corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form.  Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile.  In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
 
Certificates for shares shall be of such form and device as the Board of Directors may designate and shall state the name of the record holder of the shares represented thereby; its number; date of issuance; the number of shares for which it is issued; a summary statement or reference to the powers, designations, preferences or other special rights of such stock and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights, if any; a statement or summary of liens, if any; a conspicuous notice of restrictions upon transfer or registration of transfer, if any; a statement as to any applicable voting trust agreement; and if the shares be assessable, or, if assessments are collectible by personal action, a plain statement of such facts.
 
Upon surrender to the secretary or transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.
 
The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor.  Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated.  Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.
 
8.6
         
SPECIAL DESIGNATION ON CERTIFICATES
 
If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on
the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to transfers of stock, stock certificates and uncertificated stock), in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
 
8.7
         
LOST CERTIFICATES
 
Except as provided in this Section 8.7, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and canceled at the same time.  The Board of Directors may, in case any share certificate or certificate for any other security is lost, stolen or destroyed, authorize the issuance of replacement certificates on such terms and conditions as the board may require; the board may require indemnification of the corporation secured by a bond or other adequate security sufficient to protect the corporation against any claim that may be made against it, including any expense or liability, on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of the certificate or the issuance of the replacement certificate.
 
8.8
         
TRANSFER AGENTS AND REGISTRARS
 
The Board of Directors may appoint one or more transfer agents or transfer clerks, and one or more registrars, each of which shall be an incorporated bank or trust company  either domestic or foreign, who shall be appointed at such times and places as the requirements of the corporation may necessitate and the Board of Directors may designate.
 
8.9

8.12

9.1
         
NOTICE BY ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION
 
Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders pursuant to the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given.  Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Corporation.  Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if:
 
(i)
           
the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent; and
 
(ii)
          
such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the Corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice.
 
However, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.
Any notice given pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be deemed given:
 
(i)
           
if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice;
 
(ii)
          
if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice;
 
(iii)
         
if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and
 
(iv)
         
if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder.
 
An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the Corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
 
9.2
         
DEFINITION OF ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION
 
An "electronic transmission" means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved, and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.

Subject to Section 6.7 hereof, the original or other Bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed at any annual or special meeting of stockholders, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat.  The corporation may, in its Certificate of Incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws upon the Board of Directors.  The fact that such power has been so
conferred upon the Board of Directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws.
 
Whenever an amendment or new bylaw is adopted, it shall be copied in the book of Bylaws with the original Bylaws, in the appropriate place.  If any bylaw is repealed, the fact of repeal with the date of the meeting at which the repeal was enacted or the filing of the operative written consent(s) shall be stated in said

To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Advent uses non-GAAP measures of continuing operations' operating income, net income and net income per share, which are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses we believe appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of our past financial performance and also our prospects for the future. These adjustments to our current period GAAP results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of Advent's underlying operational results and trends and our marketplace performance. In addition, these adjusted non-GAAP results are among the information management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods.

ITEM 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On November 30, 2011, Advent Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""), entered into a Credit Agreement (the "") by and among Advent, the lenders party thereto (the ""), U.S. Bank National Association, as documentation agent, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as syndication agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent for the Lenders ("").
Advent
Credit Agreement
Lenders
Agent
 
The Credit Agreement provides for (i) a $50,000,000 revolving credit facility, with a $25,000,000 letter of credit sublimit and a $10,000,000 swingline loan sublimit (the ""), (ii) a $50,000,000 term loan facility (the ""), and (iii) a $50,000,000 delayed draw term loan facility (the "" and, together with the Term Loan A Facility, the "").  Advent may request borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility until November 30, 2016.  Advent may request borrowings under the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility until the one-year anniversary of the closing date.  The Credit Agreement also contains an increase option permitting Advent, subject to certain requirements, to arrange with the Lenders and/or new lenders for up to an aggregate of $50,000,000 in additional commitments, which commitments may be for revolving loans or term loans.  The proceeds of the loans made under the Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes.  On November 30, 2011, Advent borrowed $50,000,000 of term loans under the Term Loan A Facility.
Revolving Credit Facility
Term Loan A Facility
Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility
Term Loan Facility
 
The loans bear interest, at Advent's option, at the base rate plus a spread of 0.75% to 1.75% or an adjusted LIBOR rate (based on one, two, three or six-month interest periods) plus a spread of 1.75% to 2.75%, in each case with such spread being determined based on the consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period and certain other factors.  The base rate means the highest of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s prime rate, the federal funds rate plus a margin equal to 0.50% and the adjusted LIBOR rate for a 1-month interest period plus a margin equal to 1.00%.  Swingline loans accrue interest at a per annum rate based on the base rate plus the applicable margin for base rate loans.  Advent is also obligated to pay other customary closing fees, arrangement fees, administration fees, commitment fees and letter of credit fees for a credit facility of this size and type.
 
Interest is due and payable in arrears quarterly for loans bearing interest at the base rate and at the end of an interest period (or at each three month interval in the case of loans with interest periods greater than three months) in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted LIBOR rate.  Principal payments under the Term Loan A Facility will be made in 20 equal consecutive quarterly installments, subject to adjustment as a result of any prepayments, with the remaining outstanding principal balance and all accrued and unpaid interest due on November 30, 2016.  Principal payments under the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility mature in quarterly installments equal to 2.5% of the principal amount of delayed draw term loans made on the borrowing date, subject to adjustment as a result of any prepayments, with the remaining outstanding principal balance and all accrued and unpaid interest due on November 30, 2016.  All outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, are due on November 30, 2016.  Advent may prepay the loans and terminate the commitments, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions including minimum amounts in the case of commitment reductions and reimbursement of certain costs in the case of prepayments of LIBOR loans.  In addition, the loans become mandatorily prepayable in connection with the incurrence of certain indebtedness or upon the receipt of proceeds from certain asset sales or casualty events (subject to reinvestment rights).
 
The obligations under the Credit Agreement are required to be guaranteed by Advent's present and future domestic subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions).  Pursuant to the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, dated as of November 30, 2011 (the ""), by and among Advent, each guarantor from time to time party thereto and Agent, such obligations, including the guaranties, are secured by substantially all of the assets of Advent and the guarantors party thereto, including all of the capital stock of Advent's domestic subsidiaries and 66% of the capital stock of Advent's or a guarantor's first-tier foreign subsidiaries.
Guarantee and Collateral Agreement
 
The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict Advent and its subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, pay dividends or make distributions, make investments, make acquisitions, prepay certain
Table of Contents
indebtedness, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, enter into swap agreements and enter into restrictive agreements, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type. Advent is also required to maintain compliance with a consolidated leverage ratio, a consolidated interest coverage ratio and a minimum level of liquidity.
 
The Credit Agreement includes customary events of default that, include among other things, non-payment defaults, defaults due to the inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross default to material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults, material judgment defaults, defaults due to an unenforceability of the security documents or guarantees, and a change of control default. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the Credit Agreement. Under certain circumstances, a default interest rate will apply on all obligations during the existence of a payment event of default under the Credit Agreement at a per annum rate equal to either 2.00% above the otherwise applicable interest rate.
 
Certain of the lenders under the Credit Agreement and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with Advent or its affiliates.  They have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions.
 
The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement and the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, which are attached as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively, to this Current Report and are incorporated by reference herein.

If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of the event for which the calculation of the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio is made had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any hedging obligations applicable to such Indebtedness).  If interest on a Capital Lease Obligation is being given effect, it shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capital Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP.

In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to any withholding (including backup withholding) or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Sections 2.19(f)(ii)(A) through (E) below) shall not be required if in the Lender's judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense (or, in the case of a Change in Law, any incremental material unreimbursed cost or expense) or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.  Upon the reasonable request of such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, any Lender shall update any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.19(f).  If any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall promptly (and in any event within 10 days after such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy) notify such Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy and update the form or certification if it is legally eligible to do so.

(iii)  If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this Section 2.19(f)(iii), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.

Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid to such indemnified party pursuant to the previous sentence (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.19(g), in no event
will any indemnified party be required to pay any amount to any indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 2.19(g) if such payment would place such indemnified party in a less favorable position (on a net after-Tax basis) than such indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid.  This Section 2.19(g) shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
 
(h)  Each party's obligations under this Section 2.19 shall survive any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other obligations under the Loan Documents.

Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any) (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank eurodollar market.  A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted to the Borrower by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

provided
 
(c)  in the case of a Revolving Lender, if any Swingline Exposure or L/C Exposure of such Lender exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
 
(i)  all or any part of the Swingline Exposure and L/C Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Percentages but only to the extent the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Revolving Extensions of Credit plus such Defaulting Lender's Swingline Exposure and L/C Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Revolving Commitments;
 
(ii)           if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within three Business Days following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) first, prepay such Swingline Exposure and (y) second, cash collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Lender only the Borrower's obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender's L/C Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 8.1 for so long as such L/C Exposure is outstanding;

(v)           if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender's L/C Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Lender or any other Lender hereunder, all fees payable under Section 3.3(a) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's L/C Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Lender until and to the extent that such L/C Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and
 
(d)  in the case of a Revolving Lender, so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Issuing Lender shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender's then outstanding L/C Exposure will be 100% covered by the Revolving Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.23(c), and participating interests in any newly made Swingline Loan or any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.23(c)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).

In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Lender each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and L/C Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Revolving Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders (other than Swingline Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Revolving Percentage.

Credit Agreement
 
I, James S. Cox, the Chief Financial Officer of the Borrower, DO HEREBY CERTIFY on behalf of the Borrower, in my capacity as an officer of the Borrower and not in any individual capacity, that as of the date hereof, after giving effect to the making of the Loans under the Credit Agreement on the date hereof:
 
1.
            
The amount of the "fair value" of the assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, exceeds the amount of all "liabilities, contingent or otherwise," of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, as such quoted terms are determined in accordance with applicable federal and state laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors.
 
2.
            
The present fair saleable value of the assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is greater than the amount that will be required to pay the liability of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, on its debts as such debts become absolute and matured.
 
3.
            
The Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, do not have an unreasonably small amount of capital with which to conduct their business.
 
4.
            
The Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, will be able to pay their debts as they mature.
 
5.
            
For purposes of this Solvency Certificate, (i) "debt" means liability on a "claim", and (ii) "claim" means any (x) right to payment, whether or not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured or (y) right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right to payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured or unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured or unsecured.

The undersigned is familiar with the business and financial position of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries.

Certain Matters Relating to Receivables

(b)
          
Upon the request of the Administrative Agent at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Grantor shall notify obligors on the Receivables that the Receivables have been assigned to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties and that payments in respect thereof shall be made directly to the Administrative Agent.
 
(c)
          
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, each Grantor shall remain liable under each of the Receivables to observe and perform all the conditions and obligations to be observed and performed by it thereunder, all in accordance with the terms of any agreement giving rise thereto.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation or liability under any Receivable (or any agreement giving rise thereto) by reason of or arising out of this Agreement or the receipt by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of any payment relating thereto, nor shall the Administrative Agent or any Lender be obligated in any manner to perform any of the obligations of any Grantor under or pursuant to any Receivable (or any agreement giving rise thereto), to make any payment, to make any inquiry as to the nature or the sufficiency of any payment received by it or as to the sufficiency of any performance by any party thereunder, to present or file any claim, to take any action to enforce any performance or to collect the payment of any amounts which may have been assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any time or times.

(b)
          
Each Grantor hereby authorizes and instructs each Issuer of any Investment Property pledged by such Grantor hereunder to (i) comply with any instruction received by it from the Administrative Agent in writing that (x) states that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (y) is otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, without any other or further instructions from such Grantor, and each Grantor agrees that each Issuer shall be fully protected in so complying, and (ii) unless otherwise expressly permitted hereby, pay any dividends or other payments with respect to the Investment Property directly to the Administrative Agent.
 
6.4
          
Proceeds to be Turned Over To Administrative Agent
.  In addition to the rights of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders specified in Section 6.1 with respect to payments of Receivables, if an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, all Proceeds received by any Grantor consisting of cash, checks and other near-cash items shall be held by such Grantor in trust for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, segregated from other funds of such Grantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Grantor, be turned over to the Administrative Agent in the exact form received by such Grantor (duly indorsed by such Grantor to the Administrative Agent, if required).  All Proceeds received by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be held by the Administrative Agent in a Collateral Account maintained under its sole dominion and control.  All Proceeds while held by the Administrative Agent in a Collateral Account (or by such Grantor in trust for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) shall continue to be held as collateral security for all the Obligations and shall not constitute payment thereof until applied as provided in Section 6.5.
 
6.5
          
Application of Proceeds
.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, at any time at the Administrative Agent's election, the Administrative Agent may apply all or any part of Proceeds constituting Collateral, whether or not held in any Collateral Account, and any proceeds of the guarantee set forth in Section 2, in payment of the Obligations in the following order:
 
First
, to pay incurred and unpaid fees and expenses of the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents;

pro
rata
 
Third
, to the Administrative Agent, for application by it towards prepayment of the Obligations, among the Secured Parties according to the amounts of the Obligations then held by the Secured Parties; and
pro
rata
 
Fourth
, any balance remaining after the Obligations (other than unasserted contingent indemnification obligations) shall have been paid in full, no Letters of Credit shall be outstanding (unless cash collateralized in a manner satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) and the Commitments shall have terminated shall be paid over to the Borrower or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same.
 
6.6
          
Code and Other Remedies
.  If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, may exercise, in addition to all other rights and remedies granted to them in this Agreement and in any other instrument or agreement securing, evidencing or relating to the Obligations, all rights and remedies of a secured party under the New York UCC or any other applicable law.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent, without demand of performance or other demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any notice required by law referred to below) to or upon any Grantor or any other Person (all and each of which demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby waived), may in such circumstances forthwith collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the Collateral, or any part thereof, and/or may forthwith sell, lease, assign, give option or options to purchase, or otherwise dispose of and deliver the Collateral or any part thereof (or contract to do any of the foregoing), in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any exchange, broker's board or office of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or elsewhere upon such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable and at such prices as it may deem best, for cash or on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk.  The Administrative Agent or any Lender shall have the right upon any such public sale or sales, and, to the
 
extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase the whole or any part of the Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption in any Grantor, which right or equity is hereby waived and released.  Each Grantor further agrees, at the Administrative Agent's request, to assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Administrative Agent at places which the Administrative Agent shall reasonably select, whether at such Grantor's premises or elsewhere.  The Administrative Agent shall apply the net proceeds of any action taken by it pursuant to this Section 6.6, after deducting all reasonable costs and expenses to which it is entitled pursuant to Section 10.5 of the Credit Agreement and Section 8.4 hereof incurred in connection therewith or incidental to the care or safekeeping of any of the Collateral or in any way relating to the Collateral or the rights of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements to the extent required by Section 10.5 of the Credit Agreement and Section 8.4 hereof, to the payment in whole or in part of the Obligations, in such order as the Administrative Agent may elect, and only after such application and after the payment by the Administrative Agent of any other amount required by any provision of law, including, without limitation, Section 9-615(a)(3) of the New York UCC, need the Administrative Agent account for the surplus, if any, to any Grantor.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Grantor waives all claims, damages and demands it may acquire against the Administrative Agent or any Lender arising out of the exercise by them of any rights hereunder.  If any notice of a proposed sale or other disposition of Collateral shall be required by law, such notice shall be deemed reasonable and proper if given at least 10 days before such sale or other disposition.
 
6.7
          
Registration Rights
.  (a)  If the Administrative Agent shall determine to exercise its right to sell any or all of the Pledged Stock pursuant to Section 6.6, and if in the opinion of the Administrative Agent it is necessary or advisable to have the Pledged Stock, or that portion thereof to be sold, registered under the provisions of the Securities Act, the relevant Grantor will cause the Issuer thereof to (i) execute and deliver, and cause the directors and officers of such Issuer to execute and deliver, all such instruments and documents, and do or cause to be done all such other acts as may be, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, necessary or advisable to register the Pledged Stock, or that portion thereof to be sold, under the provisions of the Securities Act, (ii) use its best efforts to cause the registration statement relating thereto to become effective and to remain effective for a period of one year from the date of the first public offering of the Pledged Stock, or that portion thereof to be sold, and (iii) make all amendments thereto and/or to the related prospectus which, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, are necessary or advisable, all in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission applicable thereto.  Each Grantor agrees to cause such Issuer to comply with the provisions of the securities or "Blue Sky" laws of any and all jurisdictions which the Administrative Agent shall designate and to make available to its security holders, as soon as practicable, an earnings statement (which need not be audited) which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act.
 
(b)
          
Each Grantor recognizes that the Administrative Agent may be unable to effect a public sale of any or all the Pledged Stock, by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or otherwise, and may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted group of purchasers which will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof.  Each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that any such private sale may result in prices and other terms less favorable than if such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner.  The Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any of the Pledged Stock for the period of time necessary to permit the Issuer thereof to register such securities for public sale under the Securities Act, or under applicable state securities laws, even if such Issuer would agree to do so.
 
(c)
          
Each Grantor agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to do or cause to be done all such other acts as may be necessary to make such sale or sales of all or any portion of the Pledged Stock pursuant to this Section 6.7 valid and binding and in compliance with any and all other applicable Requirements of Law.  Each Grantor further agrees that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section 6.7 will cause irreparable injury to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders have no adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach and, as a consequence, that each and every covenant contained in this Section 6.7 shall be specifically enforceable against such Grantor, and such Grantor hereby waives and agrees not to assert any defenses against an action for specific performance of such covenants except for a defense that no Event of Default has occurred under the Credit Agreement.
 
(d)
          
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6.7 shall not apply to Pledged Stock to the extent that the Issuer thereof is not a Subsidiary of a Grantor.
 
6.8
          
Subordination
.  Each Grantor hereby agrees that, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent, all Indebtedness owing by it to any Subsidiary of the Borrower shall be fully subordinated to the payment in full in cash of such Grantor's Obligations (other than unasserted contingent indemnification obligations).
 
6.9
          
Deficiency
.  Each Grantor shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay its Obligations and the fees and disbursements of any attorneys employed by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to collect such deficiency (to the extent that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders are entitled to reimbursement pursuant to Section 10.5 of the Credit Agreement and Section 8.4 hereof).
 
7.1
          
Administrative Agent's Appointment as Attorney-in-Fact, etc
.  (a)  Each Grantor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Administrative Agent and any officer or agent thereof, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead of such Grantor and in the name of such Grantor or in its own name, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of this Agreement, to take any and all appropriate action and to execute any and all documents and instruments which may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor hereby gives the Administrative Agent the power and right, on behalf of such Grantor, without notice to or assent by such Grantor, to do any or all of the following:
 
(i)
           
in the name of such Grantor or its own name, or otherwise, take possession of and indorse and collect any checks, drafts, notes, acceptances or other instruments for the payment of moneys due under any Receivable or Contract or with respect to any other Collateral and file any claim or take any other action or proceeding in any court of law or equity or otherwise deemed appropriate by the Administrative Agent for the purpose of collecting any and all such moneys due under any Receivable or Contract or with respect to any other Collateral whenever payable;
 
(ii)
          
in the case of any Intellectual Property, execute and deliver, and have recorded, any and all agreements, instruments, documents and papers as the Administrative Agent may request to evidence and perfect the Administrative Agent's and the Lenders' security interest in such Intellectual Property and the goodwill and general intangibles of such Grantor relating thereto or represented thereby;
 
(iii)
         
pay or discharge taxes and Liens levied or placed on or threatened against the Collateral, effect any repairs or any insurance called for by the terms of this Agreement and pay all or any part of the premiums therefor and the costs thereof;
 
(iv)
         
execute, in connection with any sale provided for in Section 6.6 or 6.7, any indorsements, assignments or other instruments of conveyance or transfer with respect to the Collateral; and
 
(v)
          
(1)  direct any party liable for any payment under any of the Collateral to make payment of any and all moneys due or to become due thereunder directly to the Administrative Agent or as the Administrative Agent shall direct;  (2)   ask or demand for, collect, and receive payment of and receipt for, any and all moneys, claims and other amounts due or to become due at any time in respect of or arising out of any Collateral;  (3)   sign and indorse any invoices, freight or express bills, bills of lading, storage or warehouse receipts, drafts against debtors, assignments, verifications, notices and other documents in connection with any of the Collateral;  (4) commence and prosecute any suits, actions or proceedings at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect the Collateral or any portion thereof and to enforce any other right in respect of any Collateral; (5) defend any suit, action or proceeding brought against such Grantor with respect to any Collateral; (6) settle, compromise or adjust any such suit, action or proceeding and, in connection therewith, give such discharges or releases as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate; (7) assign any Copyright, Patent or Trademark (along with the goodwill of the business to which any such Copyright, Patent or Trademark pertains), throughout the world for such term or terms, on such conditions, and in such manner, as the Administrative Agent shall in its sole discretion determine; and (8) generally, sell, transfer, pledge and make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with any of the Collateral as fully and completely as though the Administrative Agent were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and do, at the Administrative Agent's option and such Grantor's expense, at any time, or from time to time, all acts and things which the Administrative Agent deems necessary to protect, preserve or realize upon the Collateral and the Administrative Agent's and the Lenders' security interests therein and to effect the intent of this Agreement, all as fully and effectively as such Grantor might do.
 
Anything in this Section 7.1(a)  to the contrary notwithstanding, the Administrative Agent agrees that it will not exercise any rights under the power of attorney provided for in this Section 7.1(a) unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.
 
(b)
          
If any Grantor fails to perform or comply with any of its agreements contained herein, the Administrative Agent, at its option, but without any obligation so to do, may perform or comply, or otherwise cause performance or compliance, with such agreement.
 
(c)
          
Each Grantor hereby ratifies all that said attorneys shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof.  All powers, authorizations and agencies contained in this Agreement are coupled with an interest and are irrevocable until this Agreement is terminated and the security interests created hereby are released.
 
7.2
          
Duty of Administrative Agent
.  The Administrative Agent's sole duty with respect to the custody, safekeeping and physical preservation of the Collateral in its possession, under Section 9-207 of the New York UCC or otherwise, shall be to deal with it in the same manner as the Administrative Agent deals with similar property for its own account.  Neither the Administrative Agent, any Lender nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of any Grantor or any other Person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to the Collateral or any part thereof.  The powers conferred on the
 
Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder are solely to protect the Administrative Agent's and the Lenders' interests in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon the Administrative Agent or any Lender to exercise any such powers.  The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be accountable only for amounts that they actually receive as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither they nor any of their officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to any Grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
 
7.3
          
Execution of Financing Statements
.  Pursuant to any applicable law, each Grantor authorizes the Administrative Agent to file or record financing statements and other filing or recording documents or instruments with respect to the Collateral without the signature of such Grantor in such form and in such offices as the Administrative Agent determines appropriate to perfect the security interests of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement.  Each Grantor authorizes the Administrative Agent to use the collateral description "all personal property" in any such financing statements.  Each Grantor hereby ratifies and authorizes the filing by the Administrative Agent of any financing statement with respect to the Collateral made prior to the date hereof.
 
7.4
          
Authority of Administrative Agent
.  Each Grantor acknowledges that the rights and responsibilities of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement with respect to any action taken by the Administrative Agent or the exercise or non-exercise by the Administrative Agent of any option, voting right, request, judgment or other right or remedy provided for herein or resulting or arising out of this Agreement shall, as between the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, be governed by the Credit Agreement and by such other agreements with respect thereto as may exist from time to time among them, but, as between the Administrative Agent and the Grantors, the Administrative Agent shall be conclusively presumed to be acting as agent for the Lenders with full and valid authority so to act or refrain from acting, and no Grantor shall be under any obligation, or entitlement, to make any inquiry respecting such authority.
 
8.1

8.3
          
No Waiver by Course of Conduct; Cumulative Remedies
.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to Section 8.1), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any Default or Event of Default.  No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof.  No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.  A waiver by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy which the Administrative Agent or such Lender would otherwise have on any future occasion.  The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law.
 
8.4
                                
Enforcement Expenses; Indemnification
.  (a)  Each Guarantor agrees to pay or reimburse each Lender and the Administrative Agent for all its reasonable and (if required) documented costs and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in collecting against such Guarantor under the guarantee contained in Section 2 or otherwise enforcing or preserving any rights under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which such Guarantor is a party, including, without limitation, the reasonable and documented fees and disbursements of one firm of counsel to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, one local counsel, as necessary, in each appropriate jurisdiction and, in the case of an actual or perceived conflict of interest where the Person affected by such conflict informs such Guarantor of such conflict and thereafter retains its own counsel, of another firm of counsel for each such affected Person.

Each Guarantor agrees to pay, and to save the Administrative Agent and the Lenders harmless from, any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from any delay in paying, any and all stamp, excise, sales or other taxes which may be payable or determined to be payable with respect to any of the Collateral or in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
 
(c)

(d)
                                
The agreements in this Section 8.4 shall survive repayment of the Obligations and all other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

Successors and Assigns

8.6
                                
Set-Off
.

Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the relevant Grantor and the Administrative Agent after any such application made by such Lender, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such application.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SAN FRANCISCO
 Advent Software, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADVS), a leading provider of software and services for the global investment management industry, today announced its Board of Directors has appointed Advent's President Peter Hess to the position of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and President, effective June 30, 2012.  He will succeed Stephanie DiMarco, Advent's founder and CEO, who is stepping down as CEO at the end of June 2012 but will continue to serve as a Director on Advent's Board and will be transitioning to an advisory role for the company's senior management.
  January 5, 2012
 
Advent's Chairman John H. Scully commented, "Stephanie DiMarco's legacy at Advent and contributions to the investment management industry are extraordinary.  Under Stephanie's leadership, Advent has evolved from a one-product company to a global industry leader with a powerful and predictable business model.  The Board would like to express its deep appreciation to Stephanie for her visionary leadership and singular contributions to Advent.  We are grateful that she will continue to share her insight and expertise as a Director, significant shareholder and advisor to the company.
 
"The Board is delighted to appoint Pete Hess as the next CEO of Advent," continued Mr. Scully.  "Pete has played an instrumental role in Advent's success, leading several of Advent's largest business groups prior to his very successful tenure as President of the company since December 2008.  Advent's Board has tremendous confidence in Pete and believes that he is the right leader for the company in its next era of growth."
 
Ms. DiMarco said, "In Pete Hess, we have an outstanding leader for Advent's future.  He has a proven track record of building exceptional teams, executing successful strategies, and delivering innovative solutions that our clients can count on.  It was under Pete's leadership that Advent's Geneva platform became the gold standard of the alternative investment industry, and, more recently, it was Pete's vision that led to the acquisition of Black Diamond and the reestablishment of Advent as the partner of choice in the advisory market.
 
"Together, we have accomplished a tremendous amount over the years, thanks to the hard work and dedication of everyone at Advent.  The company has never been stronger than we are today  and based on preliminary results, we expect strong fourth quarter 2011 bookings growth over the fourth quarter of 2010*," continued Ms. DiMarco.  "It truly has been a privilege to build and grow this great company, and it will be a pleasure to continue to serve on the Board and participate in Advent's ongoing success  I have every confidence that, with Pete's leadership, the future is bright for Advent."
 
Mr. Hess said, "Stephanie DiMarco revolutionized the investment management business almost thirty years ago when she launched Advent with the first portfolio accounting system built for the PC, and she has never stopped pushing for innovative solutions to the industry's most mission-critical challenges.  Today, thanks to Stephanie, Advent is home to incredibly talented people and a creative and high-performance culture, and it's this combination that led Advent to become the global industry leader, serving over 4,500 firms around the world.  It is a great honor to be a part of this team, and I look forward to working closely with Stephanie, the Board,
 
the rest of the senior management team and our colleagues around the world to continue delivering innovative solutions that add value for our clients, our employees, our shareholders, and our communities."
 
As President of Advent Software, Mr. Hess is currently responsible for worldwide marketing, sales, services and support for the company, including its Asset Management, Global Accounts, and Black Diamond groups, as well as the company's international operations. Prior to his appointment to President, Mr. Hess served as Executive Vice President and General Manager of Advent's largest business group, where he headed strategy, product marketing, sales, services and support for Advent's asset management solutions and led the group to record revenues.  Mr. Hess was also responsible for Advent's growing international operations.  Mr. Hess has been with Advent since 1994, and has held a variety of positions in the company, including Executive Vice President and General Manager of the Global Accounts business group, and, previously, Vice President of Sales and Vice President of Marketing.  Mr. Hess earned his undergraduate degree from Princeton University.

ITEM 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
Departure of Directors or Certain Officers
 
On February 7, 2012, James P. Roemer, who has been a member of the Board of Directors of Advent Software, Inc. (the "Company") since March 2004, notified the Company of his decision to not stand for re-election at the Company's next Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on May 9, 2012. Mr. Roemer will serve the remainder of his term as a director of the Board. Mr. Roemer did not resign as a result of any disagreement with the Company relating to its operations, policies or practices.
 
Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
On February 8, 2012, Advent Software Inc.'s Compensation Committee (the "Committee") approved the terms of the 2012 Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan (the "2012 Plan"), which applies to our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and executives who are members of our Executive Management Team.
 
The 2012 Plan has been approved pursuant to the terms of the Advent Software Inc. Executive Incentive Plan ("Executive Incentive Plan"), an incentive compensation plan intended to qualify payments thereunder as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code which will be submitted for stockholder approval at our 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  If the Executive Incentive Plan is not approved by stockholders at the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, no payments will be made under the 2012 Plan to executive officers who are "covered employees" (as defined for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code).
 
The 2012 Plan is designed to motivate and reward the executives that are members of Advent's Executive Management Team for short-term achievement of Company objectives.  Under the 2012 Plan, if the Company earns a threshold level of non-GAAP Operating Profit, the Company will pay its CEO, CFO and members of the Executive Management Team a bonus of between 126% to 250% of their 2012 base salary, up to a maximum of $2.5 million, subject to reduction as described below.
 
The Committee may exercise negative discretion to adjust the awards downward based on Company achievement of Annual Contract Value, Recognized Revenue and Non-GAAP Operating Profit milestones during the 2012 fiscal year, as well as achievement of individual executive goals.  In past years the resulting payout based on these factors has been approximately 45% to 100% of base salary.
 
For fiscal year 2012, the target bonus and maximum bonus, expressed as a percentage of base salary for the Company's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and other named executive officers, are as follows:
 
 
(1)
         
Lily Chang retired effective January 31, 2012.
 
Annual Contract Value (ACV) represents the average contribution to annual revenue from all new term license contracts, Black Diamond and Advent OnDemand sales (consistent with the methodology used to calculate and report ACV in our Annual Report on Form 10-K), plus the estimated average contribution to annual revenue from new data related or other contracts entered into during the year.
 
Recognized Revenue represents the revenue recognized in earnings by the Company in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") and is consistent with "Net Revenues" reported in our consolidated financial statements.
Table of Contents
 
Non-GAAP Operating Profit represents income from continuing operations reported as "Income from Continuing Operations" in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding stock-based employee compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets, acquisition-related costs and restructuring charges.
 
A summary of key terms of the 2012 Plan terms follows:
 
                 
The Plan is applicable to the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and the Executive Management Team, and based on Company and individual performance.
 
                 
Individual performance metrics establish the cash bonus to be awarded to each such executive.   The 2012 Plan is an annual plan and is effective for fiscal year 2012. Any cash bonuses earned will be paid by March 15, 2013.
 
                 
The 2012 Executive Incentive Plan, under which 2012 Plan awards are granted, will be submitted for stockholder approval in our 2012 proxy to allow 2012 Plan awards to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162m of the Internal Revenue Code.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 
Dated: August 16, 2012

Exhibit 3.1
 
 
1.1         
REGISTERED OFFICE
 
The registered office of the corporation shall be in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, State of Delaware.  The name of the registered agent of the corporation at such location is The Corporation Trust Company.
 
1.2         
OTHER OFFICES
 
The Board of Directors may at any time establish branch or subordinate offices at any place or places where the corporation is qualified to do business.
 
2.1         
PLACE OF MEETINGS
 
Meetings of stockholders shall be held at any place within or outside the State of Delaware as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting or in a duly executed waiver of notice thereof.  The Board of Directors may determine that a meeting shall not be held at any specific place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication as authorized in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.  In the absence of any such designation, stockholders' meetings shall be held at the principal executive office of the corporation.
 
2.2         
ANNUAL MEETING
 
(a)           The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held each year on a date and at a time designated by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting.  Each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, provided that the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast for the nominees at any meeting for the election of directors where, as of the date that is one day before the date that the corporation first files its definitive proxy statement (regardless of whether or not thereafter revised or supplemented) with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected at the meeting; for purposes of this sentence, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director.
 
(b)           At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting.  To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be: (A) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (B) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (C)  brought by a stockholder of the corporation who (1) is a stockholder of record at the time of the giving of the notice required by this Section 2.2(b) and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting and (2) has timely complied in proper written form with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.2(b).  In addition, for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, such business must be a proper matter for stockholder action pursuant to these bylaws and applicable law.  For the avoidance of doubt, clause (C) above shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to bring business before an annual meeting of stockholders.
 
(i)   
To comply with clause (C) of Section 2.2(b) above, a stockholder's notice must set forth all information required under this Section 2.2(b) and must be timely received by the secretary of the corporation.  To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received by the secretary of the corporation not less than 45 calendar days nor earlier than 75 calendar days before the one-year anniversary of the date on which the corporation first mailed its proxy materials or a notice of availability of proxy materials (whichever is earlier) in connection with the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than thirty (30) days from the date contemplated at the time of the previous year's proxy statement, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the later of one hundred twenty (120) calendar days in advance of such annual meeting or ten (10) calendar days following the date on which Public Announcement (as defined below) of the date of the meeting is first made.  In no event shall an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.  "Public Announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones New Service, Associated Press or a comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor thereto (the "1934 Act").
(ii)   To be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the secretary shall set forth as to each matter of business the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting: (A) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (B) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation's books, of the stockholder proposing such business and any Stockholder Associated Person (as defined below), (C) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person and a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the corporation entitled to vote at such meeting, (D) any derivative positions held or beneficially held by the stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person, (E) whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of such stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person with respect to any securities of the corporation, and a description of any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares), the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, or to manage the risk or benefit from share price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of, such stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person with respect to any securities of the corporation, (F) any material interest of the stockholder or a Stockholder Associated Person in such business, (G) any other information relating to such stockholder or Stockholder Associated Person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the proposal pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act, and (H)  a statement whether either such stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person will deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the corporation's voting shares required under applicable law to carry the proposal (such information provided and statements made as required by clauses (A) through (H) to constitute a "Business Solicitation Statement").  In addition, to be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the secretary must be supplemented not later than ten days following the record date to disclose the information contained in clauses (C), (D) and (E) above as of the record date.  A "Stockholder Associated Person" of any stockholder shall mean (A) any person controlling, directly or indirectly, or acting in concert with, such stockholder, (B) any beneficial owner of shares of stock of the corporation owned of record or beneficially by such stockholder and on whose behalf the proposal or nomination, as the case may be, is being made, or (C) any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with such person referred to in the preceding clauses (A) and (B).
 
(iii)  Without exception, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b).  In addition, business proposed to be brought by a stockholder may not be brought before the annual meeting if such stockholder or a Stockholder Associated Person, as applicable, takes action contrary to the representations made in the Business Solicitation Statement applicable to such business or if the Business Solicitation Statement applicable to such business contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading.  The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (b), and, if he or she should so determine, he or she shall so declare at the meeting that any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be conducted.
 
(c)           Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the contrary, only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.2(c) shall be eligible for election as directors.  Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the corporation may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders only (A) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (B) by a stockholder of the corporation who (1) was a stockholder of record at the time of the giving of the notice required by this Section 2.2(c) and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting and (2) has complied with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.2(c).  In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination to be made by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the secretary of the corporation.
 
(i)    To comply with clause (B) of Section 2.2(c) above, a nomination to be made by a stockholder must set forth all information required under this Section 2.2(c) and must be received by the secretary of the corporation at the principal executive offices of the corporation at the time set forth in, and in accordance with, the final three sentences of Section 2.2(b)(i) above.
 
(ii)   To be in proper written form, such stockholder's notice shall set forth:
 
1)             as to each person (a "nominee"), whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director:  (A) the name, age, business address and residence address of such nominee, (B) the principal occupation or employment of such nominee, (C) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by such nominee and any derivative positions held or beneficially held by such nominee, (D) whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of such nominee with respect to any securities of the corporation, and a description of any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares), the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, or to manage the risk or benefit of share price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of, such nominee with respect to any securities of the corporation, (E) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nominations are to be made by the stockholder, (F) a written statement executed by the nominee acknowledging that as a director of the corporation, the nominee will owe a fiduciary duty under Delaware law with respect to the corporation and its stockholders, (G) any other information relating to such nominee that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for elections of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to the proxy rules of the 1934 Act (including without limitation such nominee's written consent to being named in the proxy statement, if any, as a nominee and to serving as a
director if elected), and (H) a written statement from each proposed nominee as to whether such proposed nominee, if elected, intends to tender, promptly following such proposed nominee's election or re-election, an irrevocable resignation effective upon such proposed nominee's failure to receive the required vote for re-election at any meeting at which such proposed nominee would face re-election and upon acceptance of such resignation by the Board of Directors, in accordance with the corporation's Policy of the Board of Directors on Director Elections; and
 
2)             as to such stockholder giving notice, (A) the information required to be provided pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 2.2 (except that references therein to proposals of business shall instead refer to nominations of directors for purposes of this Section 2.2(c)), and (B) a statement whether either such stockholder or Stockholder Associated Person will deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of a number of the corporation's voting shares reasonably believed by such stockholder or Stockholder Associated Person to be necessary to elect such nominee(s) (such information provided and statements made as required by clauses (A) and (B) above shall constitute a "Nominee Solicitation Statement").
 
3)             At the request of the Board of Directors, any person nominated by a stockholder for election as a director shall furnish to the secretary of the corporation (A) that information required to be set forth in the stockholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee as of a date subsequent to the date on which the notice of such person's nomination was given, (B) such other information as may reasonably be required by the corporation to determine the eligibility of such person to serve as a director of the corporation or that could be material to a reasonable stockholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee and (C) a written statement from such proposed nominee as to whether such proposed nominee, if elected, intends to tender, promptly following such proposed nominee's election or re-election, an irrevocable resignation effective upon such proposed nominee's failure to receive the required vote for re-election at any meeting at which such proposed nominee would face re-election and upon acceptance of such resignation by the Board of Directors, in accordance with the corporation's Policy of the Board of Directors on Director Elections; in the absence of the furnishing of such information or statement if requested, such stockholder's nomination shall not be considered in proper form pursuant to this Section 2.2.
 
4)             Without exception, no person shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation at an annual meeting of stockholders unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.2(c).  In addition, a nominee shall not be eligible for election or re-election if a stockholder or Stockholder Associated Person, as applicable, takes action contrary to the representations made in the Nominee Solicitation Statement applicable to such nominee or if the Nominee Solicitation Statement applicable to such nominee contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.  The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these Bylaws, and if he or she should so determine, he or she shall so declare at the meeting, and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
(d)           In addition to the foregoing requirements of this Section 2.2, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of state law and of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 2.2, including, with respect to business a stockholder intends to bring before the annual meeting that involves a proposal that such stockholder requests to be included in the corporation's proxy statement, the requirements of Rule 14a-8 (or any successor provision) under the 1934 Act.  Nothing in this Section 2.2 shall be deemed to affect any right of the corporation to omit a proposal from the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 (or any successor provision) under the 1934 Act.
 
2.3

(a)           A special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time by the Board of Directors acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole Board (as defined below) or by the chief executive officer, but such special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons.  For purposes of this Section 2.3, the term "Whole Board" shall mean the total number of authorized directors whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships.  The Board of Directors acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole Board may cancel, postpone or reschedule any previously scheduled special meeting at any time, before or after the notice for such meeting has been sent to the stockholders.
 
(b)           The notice of a special meeting shall include the purpose for which the meeting is called.

To be timely, such notice must be received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which Public Announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.  A person shall not be eligible for election or re-election as a director at a special meeting unless the person is nominated (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by a stockholder in accordance with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.3(c).  In addition, a nominee shall not be eligible for election or re-election if a stockholder or Stockholder Associated
 
Person, as applicable, takes action contrary to the representations made in the Nominee Solicitation Statement applicable to such nominee or if the Nominee Solicitation Statement applicable to such nominee contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

The voting procedure for any such director election shall be as set forth in the second sentence of Section 2.2(a).
 
(d)           In addition to the foregoing requirements of this Section 2.3, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of state law and of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 2.3.

At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting.  If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

The waiver of notice or consent or approval need not specify either the business to be transacted or the purpose of any annual or special meeting of stockholders.  All such waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.
 
Attendance by a person at a meeting shall also constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at that meeting, except when the person objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required by law to be included in the notice of the meeting but not so included, if that objection is expressly made at the meeting.

STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING
 
Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the corporation must be taken at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation, and the power of stockholders to consent in writing to the taking of any action, without a duly called meeting and vote, is specifically denied. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the holders of any class or series of preferred stock shall be entitled to take action by written consent to such extent, if any, as may be provided in the terms of such class or series of preferred stock.

A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting, but the Board of Directors shall fix a new record date if the meeting is adjourned for more than thirty (30) days from the date set for the original meeting.

A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission, facsimile or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact.  The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to the irrevocability of proxies).

If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.  If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.  The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list of stockholders or the books of the corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders and of the number of shares held by each such stockholder.

(iii)  If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to meetings of stockholders).
 
If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten (10%) percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to meetings of stockholders) as far as applicable.

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS
 
The corporation shall, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended, indemnify any person against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, or proceeding in which such person was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the corporation; provided, however, that the corporation may modify the extent of such indemnification by individual contracts with its directors and officers and, provided further, that the corporation shall not be required to indemnify any director or officer in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless (i) such indemnification is expressly required to be made by law, (ii) the proceeding was authorized in advance by the Board of Directors of the corporation, (iii) such indemnification is provided by the corporation, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the corporation under the General Corporation Law of Delaware or (iv) such indemnification is required to be made pursuant to an individual contract.  For purposes of this Section 6.1, a "director" or "officer" of the corporation shall mean any person (i) who is or was a director, Corporate Officer or Administrative Officer of the corporation or (ii) who was a director or officer of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation.
 
The rights conferred on any person by this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, agreement, vote of the stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article VI shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.
 
6.2         
INDEMNIFICATION OF OTHERS
 
The corporation shall have the power, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended, to indemnify any person (other than directors and officers, as such terms are defined in Section 6.1 above) against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, or proceeding, in which such person was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party by reason of the fact that such person is or was an employee or agent of the corporation.  For purposes of this Section 6.2, an "employee" or "agent" of the corporation (other than a director or officer, as such terms are defined in Section 6.1 above) shall mean any person (i) who is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was an employee or agent of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.

6.4         
EXPENSES
 
The corporation shall advance to any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, Corporate Officer or Administrative Officer of the corporation, prior to the final disposition of the proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all expenses incurred by any such director or officer in connection with such proceeding, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay said amounts if it should be determined ultimately that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under these Bylaws or otherwise; provided, however, that the corporation shall not be required to advance expenses to any such director or officer in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless the proceeding was authorized in advance by the Board of Directors of the corporation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to Section 6.5, no advance shall be made by the corporation to a director, Corporate Officer or Administrative Officer of the corporation
or other person entitled to indemnification pursuant to these bylaws
(except by reason of the fact that such officer is or was a director of the corporation in which event this paragraph shall not apply) in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the proceeding, or (ii) if such quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.
 
6.5         
NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS
 
The rights conferred on any person by this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office. The corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents, including any person who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, respecting indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
 
6.6         
SURVIVAL OF RIGHTS
 
The rights conferred on any person by this Article VI shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or other agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
 
6.7         
AMENDMENTS
 
Any repeal or modification of this Article VI shall only be prospective and shall not affect the rights under this Article VI in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that is the cause of any proceeding against any agent of the corporation.
7.1         
MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS
 
The corporation shall, either at its principal executive office or at such place or places as designated by the Board of Directors, keep a record of its stockholders listing their names and addresses and the number and class of shares held by each stockholder, a copy of these Bylaws as amended or otherwise altered to date, accounting books and other records of its business and properties.
 
Any stockholder of record, in person or by attorney or other agent, shall, upon written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof, have the right during the usual hours for business to inspect for any proper purpose the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and records and to make copies or extracts therefrom.  A proper purpose shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a stockholder.  In every instance where an attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the right to inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act on behalf of the stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the corporation at its registered office in Delaware or at its principal place of business.
 
7.2         
INSPECTION BY DIRECTORS
 
Any director shall have the right to examine the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders and its other books and records for a purpose reasonably related to his or her position as a director.

The authority herein granted may be exercised either by such person directly or by any other person authorized to do so by proxy or power of attorney duly executed by such person having the authority.
 
7.4         
CERTIFICATION AND INSPECTION OF BYLAWS
 
The original or a copy of these Bylaws, as amended or otherwise altered to date, certified by the secretary, shall be kept at the corporation's principal executive office and shall be open to inspection by the stockholders of the corporation, at all reasonable times during office hours.
8.1         
RECORD DATE FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN NOTICE AND VOTING
 
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action other than as provided for in Article II of these Bylaws, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted and which shall not be more than sixty (60) calendar days before any such action.  In that case, only stockholders of record at the close of business on the date so fixed are entitled to receive the dividend, distribution or allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date so fixed, except as otherwise provided by law.
 
If the Board of Directors does not so fix a record date, then the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the applicable resolution.
 
8.2         
CHECKS; DRAFTS; EVIDENCES OF INDEBTEDNESS
 
From time to time, the Board of Directors shall determine by resolution which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness that are issued in the name of or payable to the corporation, and only the persons so authorized shall sign or endorse those instruments.
 
8.3         
FISCAL YEAR
 
The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors.
 
8.4         
CORPORATE CONTRACTS AND INSTRUMENTS:  HOW EXECUTED
 
The Board of Directors, except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws, may authorize and empower any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation; such power and authority may be general or confined to specific instances.  Unless so authorized or ratified by the Board of Directors or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.
8.5         
STOCK CERTIFICATES; TRANSFER; PARTLY PAID SHARES
 
The shares of the corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board of Directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares.  Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation.  Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the Board of Directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and, upon request, every holder of uncertificated shares, shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, the chairman or vice-chairman of the Board of Directors, or the president or vice-president, and by the chief financial officer or an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant secretary of such corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form.  Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile.  In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
 
Certificates for shares shall be of such form and device as the Board of Directors may designate and shall state the name of the record holder of the shares represented thereby; its number; date of issuance; the number of shares for which it is issued; a summary statement or reference to the powers, designations, preferences or other special rights of such stock and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights, if any; a statement or summary of liens, if any; a conspicuous notice of restrictions upon transfer or registration of transfer, if any; a statement as to any applicable voting trust agreement; and if the shares be assessable, or, if assessments are collectible by personal action, a plain statement of such facts.
 
Upon surrender to the secretary or transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.
 
The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor.  Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated.  Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.
 
8.6         
SPECIAL DESIGNATION ON CERTIFICATES
 
If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on
 
the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to transfers of stock, stock certificates and uncertificated stock), in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
 
8.7         
LOST CERTIFICATES
 
Except as provided in this Section 8.7, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and canceled at the same time.  The Board of Directors may, in case any share certificate or certificate for any other security is lost, stolen or destroyed, authorize the issuance of replacement certificates on such terms and conditions as the board may require; the board may require indemnification of the corporation secured by a bond or other adequate security sufficient to protect the corporation against any claim that may be made against it, including any expense or liability, on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of the certificate or the issuance of the replacement certificate.
 
8.8         
TRANSFER AGENTS AND REGISTRARS
 
The Board of Directors may appoint one or more transfer agents or transfer clerks, and one or more registrars, each of which shall be an incorporated bank or trust company  either domestic or foreign, who shall be appointed at such times and places as the requirements of the corporation may necessitate and the Board of Directors may designate.
 
8.9         
CONSTRUCTION; DEFINITIONS
 
Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction and definitions in the General Corporation Law of Delaware shall govern the construction of these Bylaws.  Without limiting the generality of this provision, as used in these Bylaws, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the term "person" includes both an entity and a natural person.
 
8.10       
PROVISIONS ADDITIONAL TO PROVISIONS OF LAW
 
All restrictions, limitations, requirements and other provisions of these Bylaws shall be construed, insofar as possible, as supplemental and additional to all provisions of law applicable to the subject matter thereof and shall be fully complied with in addition to the said provisions of law unless such compliance shall be illegal.
8.11       
PROVISIONS CONTRARY TO PROVISIONS OF LAW
 
Any article, section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause or phrase of these Bylaws which upon being construed in the manner provided in Section 8.11 hereof, shall be contrary to or inconsistent with any applicable provisions of law, shall not apply so long as said provisions of law shall remain in effect, but such result shall not affect the validity or applicability of any other portions of these Bylaws, it being hereby declared that these Bylaws would have been adopted and each article, section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more articles, sections, subsections, subdivisions, sentences, clauses or phrases is or are illegal.
 
8.12       
NOTICES
 
Any reference in these Bylaws to the time a notice is given or sent means, unless otherwise expressly provided, the time a written notice by mail is deposited in the United States mails, postage prepaid; or the time any other written notice is personally delivered to the recipient or is delivered to a common carrier for transmission, or actually transmitted by the person giving the notice by electronic means, to the recipient; or the time any oral notice is communicated, in person or by telephone or wireless means, to the recipient or to a person at the office of the recipient who the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the recipient.
 
9.1         
NOTICE BY ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION
 
Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders pursuant to the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given.  Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Corporation.  Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if:
 
(i)            the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent; and
 
(ii)           such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the Corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice.
 
However, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.
Any notice given pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be deemed given:
 
(i)            if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice;
 
(ii)           if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice;
 
(iii)          if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and
 
(iv)          if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder.
 
An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the Corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
 
9.2         
DEFINITION OF ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION
 
An "electronic transmission" means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved, and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.
 
9.3         
INAPPLICABILITY
 
Notice by a form of electronic transmission shall not apply to Section 164 (relating to failure to pay for stock; remedies), Section 296 (relating to adjudication of claims; appeal), Section 311 (relating to revocation of voluntary dissolution), Section 312 (relating to renewal, revival, extension and restoration of certificate of incorporation) or Section 324 (relating to attachment of shares of stock or any option, right or interest therein) of the DGCL.
 
Subject to Section 6.7 hereof, the original or other Bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed at any annual or special meeting of stockholders, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat.  The corporation may, in its Certificate of Incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws upon the Board of Directors.  The fact that such power has been so
conferred upon the Board of Directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws.
 
Whenever an amendment or new bylaw is adopted, it shall be copied in the book of Bylaws with the original Bylaws, in the appropriate place.  If any bylaw is repealed, the fact of repeal with the date of the meeting at which the repeal was enacted or the filing of the operative written consent(s) shall be stated in said

ITEM 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
 
On June 12, 2013, Advent Software, Inc. ("") entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the ""), by and among Advent, the several lenders parties from time to time thereto (the ""), Capital One, National Association, Comerica Bank, Compass Bank, Fifth Third Bank, HSBC Bank USA, N.A., Regions Bank, National Association, U.S. Bank National Association, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., collectively, the co-documentation agents, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent for the Lenders (""). The Restated Credit Agreement amends and restates Advent's existing Credit Agreement, dated November 30, 2011, by and among Advent, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders party thereto.
Advent
Restated Credit Agreement
Lenders
Agent
 
The Restated Credit Agreement provides for (i) a $200 million revolving credit facility, with a $25 million letter of credit sublimit and a $10 million swingline loan sublimit and (ii) a $225 million term loan facility. Advent may request revolving loans, swingline loans or the issuance of letters of credit until June 12, 2018, subject to demonstrating pro forma compliance with the financial covenant requirement under the Restated Credit Agreement. The Restated Credit Agreement also contains an incremental facility permitting Advent, subject to certain requirements, to arrange with the Lenders and/or new lenders for up to an aggregate of $75 million in additional commitments, which commitments may be for revolving loans or term loans. The proceeds of the revolving loans and term loans made under the Restated Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes, including to finance dividends, to repurchase Common Shares, to finance acquisitions or to finance other investments. On June 13, 2013, Advent borrowed $225 million of term loans that will be used to finance the Special Dividend (as described below).
 
The revolving loans and terms loans bear interest, at Advent's option, at the alternate base rate plus a margin of 0.25% to 1.25% or an adjusted LIBOR rate (based on one, two, three or six-month interest periods) plus a margin of 1.25% to 2.25%, in each case with such margin being determined based on the consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. The "alternate base rate" means the highest of (i)Agent's prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus a margin equal to 0.50% and (iii) the adjusted LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period plus a margin equal to 1.00%. Swingline loans accrue interest at a per annum rate based on the alternate base rate plus the applicable margin for alternate base rate loans. Advent is also obligated to pay other customary closing fees, arrangement fees, administration fees, commitment fees and letter of credit fees for a credit facility of this size and type.
 
Interest is due and payable in arrears quarterly for revolving loans and term loans bearing interest at the base rate, and at the end of the applicable elected interest period (or at each three month interval in the case of loans with interest periods greater than three months) in the case of revolving loans and term loans bearing interest at the adjusted LIBOR rate. Principal payments with respect to the term loans will be made in 20 equal consecutive quarterly principal installments of $5 million, commencing on September 13, 2013, subject to adjustment as a result of any prepayments, with the remaining outstanding principal balance and all accrued and unpaid interest due on June 12, 2018. Principal payments with respect to the revolving loans, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, are due on June 12, 2018. Advent may prepay the revolving loans and term loans and terminate the revolving commitments, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions, including minimum amounts in the case of commitment reductions and reimbursement of certain costs in the case of prepayments of LIBOR loans. In addition, the term loans become mandatorily prepayable in connection with the incurrence of certain indebtedness or upon the receipt of proceeds from certain asset sales or casualty events, subject to reinvestment rights.
Table of Contents
 
The obligations under the Restated Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Advent's present and future domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, dated as of June 12, 2013 (the ""), by and among Advent, each guarantor from time to time party thereto and Agent, such obligations, including the guarantees, are secured by substantially all of the assets of Advent and the guarantors party thereto, including all of the capital stock of Advent's domestic subsidiaries and 66% of the capital stock of Advent's or a guarantor's first-tier foreign subsidiaries.
Restated Guarantee and Collateral Agreement
 
The Restated Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict Advent and its subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, pay dividends or make distributions, make investments, make acquisitions, prepay certain indebtedness, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, enter into swap agreements and enter into restrictive agreements, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type. Advent is also required to maintain compliance with a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio.
 
The Restated Credit Agreement includes customary events of default that include, among other things, non-payment defaults, defaults due to the inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross default to material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults, material judgment defaults, defaults due to an unenforceability of the security documents or guarantees, and a change of control default. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the Restated Credit Agreement. A default interest rate will apply on all obligations during the existence of a payment event of default under the Restated Credit Agreement at a per annum rate equal to 2.00% above the otherwise applicable interest rate.
 
The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Restated Credit Agreement and the Restated Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, which are attached as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.

If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of the event for which the calculation of the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio is made had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any hedging obligations applicable to such Indebtedness).  If interest on a Capital Lease Obligation is being given effect, it shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capital Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP.  To the extent it is being given effect, interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a London interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Borrower may designate.

If such notice is given (x) any Eurodollar Loans under the relevant Facility requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans, (y) any Loans under the relevant Facility that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurodollar Loans shall be continued as ABR Loans and (z) any outstanding Eurodollar Loans under the relevant Facility shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period, to ABR Loans.  Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further Eurodollar Loans under the relevant Facility shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert Loans under the relevant Facility to Eurodollar Loans.

(b)  Mandatory prepayments of the Term Loans required by Section 2.11 shall be made according to the respective outstanding amounts of the Term Loans, provided that Incremental Term Loans may be prepaid on a less favorable basis if specified in the applicable Incremental Facility Activation Notice.

The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to each relevant Lender promptly upon receipt in like funds as received, net of any amounts owing by such Lender pursuant to Section 9.7.  If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurodollar Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day.  If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.  In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.
 
(e)  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rate equal to the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (ii) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent.  A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  If such Lender's share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans under the relevant Facility, on demand, from the Borrower.
 
(f)  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by the Borrower hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders their respective shares of a corresponding amount.  If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to the daily average Federal

Funds Effective Rate.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower.
 
(g)  If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.7(b), 2.7(c), 2.17(e), 2.17(f), 2.19(e), 3.4(a) or 9.7, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations to it under such Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.

(a)   If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof:
 
(i)  shall subject any Credit Party to any Taxes (other than Indemnified Taxes and Excluded Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;
 
(ii)  shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit (or participations therein) by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate; or
 
(iii)  shall impose on such Lender any other condition, cost or expense;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Credit Party, by an amount that such Lender or other Credit Party deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Loans or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly, but in any event no later than 15 days, pay such Lender or such other Credit Party, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such other Credit Party for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable.  If any Lender or such other Credit Party becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it shall promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled.
 
(b)  If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or liquidity or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy or liquidity (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor and the certificate referred to in Section
 
2.18(d), the Borrower shall promptly, but in any event no later than 15 days following receipt thereof, pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation for such reduction.
 
(c)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) all requests, rules, guidelines, requirements and directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or by United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, and (ii) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines, requirements and directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith or in implementation thereof, shall in each case be deemed to be a change in law, regardless of the date enacted, adopted, issued or implemented.
 
(d)  A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any amounts incurred more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such nine-month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect.  The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

Taxes
.  (a)  Each payment by or on behalf of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without withholding for any Taxes, unless such withholding is required by any law (as determined by the applicable withholding agent in its sole discretion exercised in good faith), , that (i) if any Taxes are withheld by a Loan Party (or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be) and such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the amount payable by such Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that, net of such withholding (including such withholding applicable to additional amounts payable under this Section), the applicable Credit Party receives the amount it would have received had no such withholding been made, and (ii) if the Taxes were withheld by a Loan Party, such Loan Party shall timely pay the full amount of such Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
provided
 
(b)  The Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
 
(c)  As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
(d)  The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Credit Party for any Indemnified Taxes that are paid or payable by such Credit Party in connection with any Loan Document (including amounts paid or payable under this Section 2.19(d)) and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  The indemnity under this Section 2.19(d) shall be paid within 10 days after the Credit Party delivers to the Borrower a certificate stating the amount of any Indemnified Taxes so paid or payable by such Credit Party and describing the basis for the indemnification claim.  Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error.  Such Credit Party shall deliver a copy of such certificate to the Administrative Agent.
 
(e)  Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for any Taxes (but, in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, only to the extent that the Loan Parties have not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so) attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.

In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to any withholding (including backup withholding) or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Sections 2.19(f)(ii)(A) through (E) below) shall not be required if in the Lender's judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense (or, in the case of a Change in Law, any incremental material unreimbursed cost or expense) or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.  Upon the reasonable request of such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, any Lender shall update any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.19(f).  If any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall promptly (and in any event within 10 days after such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy) notify such Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy and update the form or certification if it is legally eligible to do so.

Solely for purposes of this Section 2.19(f)(iii), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.

Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid to such indemnified party pursuant to the previous sentence (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.19(g), in no event
 
will any indemnified party be required to pay any amount to any indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 2.19(g) if such payment would place such indemnified party in a less favorable position (on a net after-Tax basis) than such indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid.  This Section 2.19(g) shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
 
(h)  Each party's obligations under this Section 2.19 shall survive any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other obligations under the Loan Documents.

2.7

The obligations of each Qualified Keepwell Provider under this Section 2.8 shall remain in full force and
effect until all the Borrower Obligations and the obligations of each Guarantor under the guarantee contained in this Section 2 shall have been satisfied by payment in full (other than unasserted contingent indemnification obligations and, in the absence of a Default or Event of Default, obligations under or in respect of Specified Swap Agreements or Specified Cash Management Agreements), no Letter of Credit shall be outstanding and the Commitments shall be terminated, notwithstanding that from time to time during the term of the Credit Agreement the Borrower may be free from any Borrower Obligations.  Each Qualified Keepwell Provider intends that this Section 2.8 constitute, and this Section 2.8 shall be deemed to constitute, a "keepwell, support, or other agreement" for the benefit of each other Loan Party for all purposes of section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.

(d)           Such Grantor is the record and beneficial owner of, and has good and marketable title to, the Investment Property pledged by it hereunder, free of any and all Liens or options in favor of, or claims of, any other Person, except the security interest created by this Agreement.

Code and Other Remedies

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent, without demand of performance or other demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any notice required by law referred to below) to or upon any Grantor or any other Person (all and each of which demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby waived), may in such circumstances forthwith collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the Collateral, or any part thereof, and/or may forthwith sell, lease, assign, give option or options to purchase, or otherwise dispose of and deliver the Collateral or any part thereof (or contract to do any of the foregoing), in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any exchange, broker's board or office of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or elsewhere upon such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable and at such prices as it may deem best, for cash or on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk.  The Administrative Agent or any Lender shall have the right upon any such public sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase the whole or any part of the Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption in any Grantor, which right or equity is hereby waived and released.  Each Grantor further agrees, at the Administrative Agent's request, to
assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Administrative Agent at places which the Administrative Agent shall reasonably select, whether at such Grantor's premises or elsewhere.  The Administrative Agent shall apply the net proceeds of any action taken by it pursuant to this Section 6.6, after deducting all reasonable costs and expenses to which it is entitled pursuant to Section 10.5 of the Credit Agreement and Section 8.4 hereof incurred in connection therewith or incidental to the care or safekeeping of any of the Collateral or in any way relating to the Collateral or the rights of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements to the extent required by Section 10.5 of the Credit Agreement and Section 8.4 hereof, to the payment in whole or in part of the Obligations, in such order as the Administrative Agent may elect, and only after such application and after the payment by the Administrative Agent of any other amount required by any provision of law, including, without limitation, Section 9-615(a)(3) of the New York UCC, need the Administrative Agent account for the surplus, if any, to any Grantor.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Grantor waives all claims, damages and demands it may acquire against the Administrative Agent or any Lender arising out of the exercise by them of any rights hereunder.  If any notice of a proposed sale or other disposition of Collateral shall be required by law, such notice shall be deemed reasonable and proper if given at least 10 days before such sale or other disposition.
 
6.7         
Registration Rights
.  (a)  If the Administrative Agent shall determine to exercise its right to sell any or all of the Pledged Stock pursuant to Section 6.6, and if in the opinion of the Administrative Agent it is necessary or advisable to have the Pledged Stock, or that portion thereof to be sold, registered under the provisions of the Securities Act, the relevant Grantor will cause the Issuer thereof to (i) execute and deliver, and cause the directors and officers of such Issuer to execute and deliver, all such instruments and documents, and do or cause to be done all such other acts as may be, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, necessary or advisable to register the Pledged Stock, or that portion thereof to be sold, under the provisions of the Securities Act, (ii) use its best efforts to cause the registration statement relating thereto to become effective and to remain effective for a period of one year from the date of the first public offering of the Pledged Stock, or that portion thereof to be sold, and (iii) make all amendments thereto and/or to the related prospectus which, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, are necessary or advisable, all in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission applicable thereto.  Each Grantor agrees to cause such Issuer to comply with the provisions of the securities or "Blue Sky" laws of any and all jurisdictions which the Administrative Agent shall designate and to make available to its security holders, as soon as practicable, an earnings statement (which need not be audited) which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act.
 
(b)           Each Grantor recognizes that the Administrative Agent may be unable to effect a public sale of any or all the Pledged Stock, by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or otherwise, and may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted group of purchasers which will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof.  Each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that any such private sale may result in prices and other terms less favorable than if such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner.  The Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any of the Pledged Stock for the period of time necessary to permit the Issuer thereof to register such securities for public sale under the Securities Act, or under applicable state securities laws, even if such Issuer would agree to do so.
 
(c)           Each Grantor agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to do or cause to be done all such other acts as may be necessary to make such sale or sales of all or any portion of the Pledged Stock pursuant to this Section 6.7 valid and binding and in compliance with any and all other applicable Requirements of Law.  Each Grantor further agrees that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this
Section 6.7 will cause irreparable injury to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders have no adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach and, as a consequence, that each and every covenant contained in this Section 6.7 shall be specifically enforceable against such Grantor, and such Grantor hereby waives and agrees not to assert any defenses against an action for specific performance of such covenants except for a defense that no Event of Default has occurred under the Credit Agreement.
 
(d)           For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6.7 shall not apply to Pledged Stock to the extent that the Issuer thereof is not a Subsidiary of a Grantor.
 
6.8         
Subordination
.  Each Grantor hereby agrees that, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent, all Indebtedness owing by it to any Subsidiary of the Borrower or the Borrower shall be fully subordinated to the payment in full in cash of such Grantor's Obligations (other than unasserted contingent indemnification obligations).
 
6.9         
Deficiency
.  Each Grantor shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay its Obligations and the fees and disbursements of any attorneys employed by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to collect such deficiency (to the extent that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders are entitled to reimbursement pursuant to Section 10.5 of the Credit Agreement and Section 8.4 hereof).
 
7.1         
Administrative Agent's Appointment as Attorney-in-Fact, etc
.  (a)  Each Grantor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Administrative Agent and any officer or agent thereof, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead of such Grantor and in the name of such Grantor or in its own name, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of this Agreement, to take any and all appropriate action and to execute any and all documents and instruments which may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor hereby gives the Administrative Agent the power and right, on behalf of such Grantor, without notice to or assent by such Grantor, to do any or all of the following:
 
(i)            in the name of such Grantor or its own name, or otherwise, take possession of and indorse and collect any checks, drafts, notes, acceptances or other instruments for the payment of moneys due under any Receivable or Contract or with respect to any other Collateral and file any claim or take any other action or proceeding in any court of law or equity or otherwise deemed appropriate by the Administrative Agent for the purpose of collecting any and all such moneys due under any Receivable or Contract or with respect to any other Collateral whenever payable;
 
(ii)           in the case of any Intellectual Property, execute and deliver, and have recorded, any and all agreements, instruments, documents and papers as the Administrative Agent may request to evidence and perfect the Administrative Agent's and the Secured Parties' security interest in such Intellectual Property and the goodwill and general intangibles of such Grantor relating thereto or represented thereby;

Anything in this Section 7.1(a)  to the contrary notwithstanding, the Administrative Agent agrees that it will not exercise any rights under the power of attorney provided for in this Section 7.1(a) unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.
 
(b)           If any Grantor fails to perform or comply with any of its agreements contained herein, the Administrative Agent, at its option, but without any obligation so to do, may perform or comply, or otherwise cause performance or compliance, with such agreement.

7.2         
Duty of Administrative Agent
.  The Administrative Agent's sole duty with respect to the custody, safekeeping and physical preservation of the Collateral in its possession, under Section 9-207 of the New York UCC or otherwise, shall be to deal with it in the same manner as the Administrative Agent deals with similar property for its own account.  Neither the Administrative Agent, any Lender nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of any Grantor or any other Person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to the Collateral or any part thereof.  The powers conferred on the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder are solely to protect the Administrative Agent's and the Secured Parties' interests in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon the Administrative Agent or any Lender to exercise any such powers.  The Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts that they actually receive as a result of the exercise of such powers, and
neither they nor any of their officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to any Grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
 
7.3         
Execution of Financing Statements
.  Pursuant to any applicable law, each Grantor authorizes the Administrative Agent to file or record financing statements and other filing or recording documents or instruments with respect to the Collateral without the signature of such Grantor in such form and in such offices as the Administrative Agent determines appropriate to perfect the security interests of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement.  Each Grantor authorizes the Administrative Agent to use the collateral description "all personal property" in any such financing statements.  Each Grantor hereby ratifies and authorizes the filing by the Administrative Agent of any financing statement with respect to the Collateral made prior to the date hereof.
 
7.4         
Authority of Administrative Agent
.  Each Grantor acknowledges that the rights and responsibilities of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement with respect to any action taken by the Administrative Agent or the exercise or non-exercise by the Administrative Agent of any option, voting right, request, judgment or other right or remedy provided for herein or resulting or arising out of this Agreement shall, as between the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, be governed by the Credit Agreement and by such other agreements with respect thereto as may exist from time to time among them, but, as between the Administrative Agent and the Grantors, the Administrative Agent shall be conclusively presumed to be acting as agent for the Secured Parties with full and valid authority so to act or refrain from acting, and no Grantor shall be under any obligation, or entitlement, to make any inquiry respecting such authority.
 
8.1         
Amendments in Writing
.  None of the terms or provisions of this Agreement may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except in accordance with Section 10.1 of the Credit Agreement.
 
8.2         
Notices
.  All notices, requests and demands to or upon the Administrative Agent or any Grantor hereunder shall be effected in the manner provided for in Section 10.2 of the Credit Agreement; provided that any such notice, request or demand to or upon any Guarantor shall be addressed to such Guarantor at its notice address set forth on to the Disclosure Letter or such other address as may be notified to the Administrative Agent from time to time.
Schedule A
 
8.3         
No Waiver by Course of Conduct; Cumulative Remedies
.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to Section 8.1), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any Default or Event of Default.  No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof.  No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.  A waiver by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy which the Administrative Agent or such Lender would otherwise have on any future occasion.  The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law.
 
8.4         
Enforcement Expenses; Indemnification
.  (a)  Each Guarantor agrees to pay or reimburse each Lender and the Administrative Agent for all its reasonable and (if required) documented costs and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in collecting against such Guarantor under the guarantee contained in
Section 2 or otherwise enforcing or preserving any rights under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which such Guarantor is a party, including, without limitation, the reasonable and documented fees and disbursements of one firm of counsel to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, one local counsel, as necessary, in each appropriate jurisdiction and, in the case of an actual or perceived conflict of interest where the Person affected by such conflict informs such Guarantor of such conflict and thereafter retains its own counsel, of another firm of counsel for each such affected Person.
 
(b)           Each Guarantor agrees to pay, and to save the Administrative Agent and the Lenders harmless from, any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from any delay in paying, any and all stamp, excise, sales or other taxes which may be payable or determined to be payable with respect to any of the Collateral or in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
 
(c)           Each Guarantor agrees to pay, and to save the Administrative Agent and the Lenders harmless from, any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and administration of this Agreement to the extent the Borrower would be required to do so pursuant to Section 10.5 of the Credit Agreement.
 
(d)           The agreements in this Section 8.4 shall survive repayment of the Obligations and all other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
 
8.5         
Successors and Assigns
.  This Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of each Grantor and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and their successors and assigns; provided that no Grantor may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.
 
8.6         
Set-Off
.  In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to any Grantor, any such notice being expressly waived by each Grantor to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any Obligations becoming due and payable by any Grantor (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), to apply to the payment of such Obligations, by setoff or otherwise, any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender, any affiliate thereof or any of their respective branches or agencies to or for the credit or the account of such Grantor.  Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the relevant Grantor and the Administrative Agent after any such application made by such Lender, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such application.
provided
 
8.7         
Counterparts
.  This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts (including by email or telecopy), and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.
 
8.8         
Severability
.  Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SAN FRANCISCO
 June 13, 2013  Advent Software, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADVS), a leading provider of software and services for the global investment management industry, today announced a one-time special cash dividend of $9 per share totaling approximately $470 million. The special dividend will be financed with cash on hand and proceeds from Advent's recently closed $425 million senior credit facility.
 
"We have worked hard to build a business with healthy and predictable cash flows so that we can deliver value to our shareholders while making the investments that will continue to benefit our clients. With our large client base and predictable business model, we can both service this debt and execute on our strategy to eliminate boundaries between systems, information and people," said Pete Hess, Advent's CEO and President. "Advent's Board believes we can best maximize shareholder value by taking advantage of the favorable liquidity and flexibility of current debt capital markets with a recapitalization of our balance sheet, which allows us to return capital to shareholders and enable them to continue to participate in Advent's future performance."
 
Special Cash Dividend of $9 per Share
 
The special dividend was approved by Advent's Board of Directors on June 12, 2013 and will be payable on July 9, 2013 to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 1, 2013. Of the $9 per share distribution, Advent currently expects between $2 to $4 per share to be characterized as a dividend, and the remaining amount of the distribution to be characterized as a return of capital.  The ultimate tax characterization of the distribution will be reported to shareholders on a Form 1099-DIV shortly after the end of the year. Stockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax effects of the dividend to them.
 
$425 Million Senior Credit Facility
 
The senior credit facility is composed of a $225 million term loan facility and a $200 million revolving credit facility.  The new term loan has repayments of $5 million per quarter and the remaining balance will mature in June 2018.  Interest on the term loan and any revolving loan initially accrues at LIBOR + 225 basis points.  Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, the LIBOR spread can be reduced to the extent Advent's leverage ratio decreases.  The revolving credit facility will also mature in June 2018.  Advent may prepay the term loans and revolving loans at any time without penalty.  Prior to replacing Advent's current facility with this new senior credit facility, Advent repaid in full the outstanding loans under its existing credit facility. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and BofA Merrill Lynch acted as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners for the senior credit facility.  The terms of the senior credit facility are more fully described in Advent's current report on Form 8-K filed today.
 
Equity Award Modifications
 
The Company modified its outstanding stock option awards to reflect the dividend by reducing the exercise price by $9 per option.  For certain options that cannot be reduced by the full $9, Advent will compensate those option holders with a cash payment for the difference between $9 and the reduction of their exercise price.  Holders of restricted stock units (RSU) will receive the right to receive $9 per RSU upon vesting.
 
Financial Impact of the Recapitalization Transactions
 
In connection with the recapitalization transactions, the Company incurred various fees from third parties that are not included in capitalized debt issue costs.  The Company currently expects its financial results to be impacted by these third-party expenses, equity award modifications, and other debt costs as described in the table below.
 
 
The Company will exclude all of the above charges from the calculation of its non-GAAP financial measures.  (The ultimate stock option modification charges and payments will be determined after the ex-dividend date and therefore these charges may be impacted by changes in market conditions.)
 
Additionally, interest expense for the second quarter of 2013 (including creditor fees and third-party expenses incurred in connection with the debt issuance) is expected to be approximately $1.7 million and interest expense in the third quarter of 2013 (including cash interest from the new debt and the amortization of capitalized debt issue costs) is currently expected to be approximately $2.7 million.
 
Common shares outstanding as of June 12, 2013 were 52 million shares.  On a fully diluted basis, weighted average shares outstanding for the second quarter of 2013 is expected to be 54 million shares.
 
Qatalyst Partners LP acted as financial advisor to Advent in this transaction.
 
Forward-looking Statement
 
The estimates and other forward-looking statements included in this presentation reflect management's best judgment based on factors currently known and involve risks and uncertainties; our actual results may differ materially from those discussed here. These risks and uncertainties include potential fluctuations in the number of shares outstanding and other risks detailed from time to time in our SEC reports including, but not limited to, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our 2012 annual report on Form 10-K. The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements including any guidance, whether as a result of events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
