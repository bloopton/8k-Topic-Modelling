ITEM 4. CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT. On June 24, 2002, Black Box Corporation ("the Company") dismissed Arthur Andersen LLP ("Arthur Andersen") as the Company's independent public accountants and engaged Ernst & Young LLP ("E&Y") to serve as the Company's independent public accountants for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2003. This determination was approved by the Company's Board of Directors upon the recommendation of its Audit Committee. The appointment of E&Y will be submitted for stockholder ratification at the Company's 2002 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on August 15, 2002. Arthur Andersen's reports on the Company's consolidated financial statements for each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2002 and 2001 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion. The March 31, 2002 report contained an explanatory fourth paragraph disclosing the Company's change in its method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets. The March 31, 2001 and 2000 reports were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2002 and 2001 and through June 24, 2002, there were no disagreements with Arthur Andersen on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to Arthur Andersen's satisfaction, would have caused them to make reference to the subject matter in connection with their report on the Company's consolidated financial statements for such years; and there were no reportable events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. The Company has provided Arthur Andersen with a copy of the foregoing statements. Attached as Exhibit 16.1 to this report is a copy of a letter from Arthur Andersen stating it found no basis for disagreement with such statements. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2002 and 2001 and through the date of the Board's decision, the Company did not consult E&Y with respect to the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's consolidated financial statements, or any other matters or reportable events as set forth in Items 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.

Exhibit 99.1 Black Box Corporation Reports Fourth Quarter and Total Year Fiscal 2003 Results PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 7, 2003-- Declares Cash Dividend, Increase in Existing Share Repurchase Program and Addition to Board of Directors Black Box Corporation (Nasdaq:BBOX) today reported for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2003, diluted earnings per share of 21 cents compared to 62 cents last year. Corresponding reported net income for the quarter was $4.2 million or 3.1% of revenues, compared to $12.9 million or 8.1% of revenues last year. Excluding special items in each period, diluted earnings per share were 55 cents for the quarter compared to 72 cents last year and net income was $10.8 million or 8.0% of revenues compared to $15.2 million or 9.5% last year. Management believes it is important to present both diluted earnings per share and net income excluding special items to provide a clearer understanding of the ongoing operations of the Company. Included in the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2003 numbers is a negative 6 cents diluted earnings per share impact from certain offices, which are in the process of being consolidated with other nearby offices. As a result of these consolidations, this negative impact should go to zero for the first quarter of fiscal 2004. As previously announced, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge for special items of $10.4 million during the fourth quarter related primarily to adjusting the cost structure of selected operating offices and reserving for specific accounts receivables. Relative to these cost reduction efforts, operating costs are expected to be reduced by $8 million annually. In accordance with SEC Regulation G, the attached financial charts include a reconciliation of all non-GAAP financial measures in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Total revenues for the quarter were $135 million, down 16% from $160 million last year. Total revenues on a same-office basis were down 17% compared to last year. North American revenues were $87 million, down 21% from last year's $109 million. European revenues were $38 million, comparable to last year's $38 million. All Other revenues were $10 million, down 19% from last year's $13 million. Fourth quarter cash provided by operating activities was $23 million, up 30% compared to $18 million last year. Free cash flow was $25 million, up 13% compared to $22 million last year. The fourth quarter's free cash flow of $25 million was used towards: Black Box stock repurchases of $21 million; debt reduction of $3 million; and dividend payments of $1 million. Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available for stock repurchases, mergers, dividend payments or debt reduction. Total operating income for the fourth quarter was 5.4% compared to 13.4% last year. Excluding special items in each period, operating income for the quarter was 13.1% compared to 15.6% last year. Management believes it is important to present operating income excluding special items to provide a clearer understanding of the ongoing operations of the Company. Backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $51 million, down from $55 million at the end of the third quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the year were $2.39 compared to $2.97 last year, down 20%. Corresponding net income was $48.7 million or 8.0% of revenues, compared to $62.0 million or 8.3% of revenues last year, down 22%. Excluding special items in each period, diluted earnings per share were $2.72 for the year compared to $3.23 last year, down 16% and net income was $55.3 million or 9.1% of revenues compared to $67.4 million or 9.1% last year, down 18%. Total revenues for the year were $605 million compared to $744 million last year, down 19%. North American revenues were $410 million, down 23% from last year's $533 million. European revenues were $154 million, comparable to last year's $156 million. All Other revenues were $41 million, down 24% from last year's $55 million. Cash provided by operating activities for the year was $85 million, up 26% compared to $68 million last year. Free cash flow for the year was $96 million, up 24% compared to $78 million for the same period last year. This free cash flow was used towards: Black Box stock repurchases of $59 million; debt reduction of $28 million; merger activity of $7 million; dividend payments of $1 million; and an increase in cash on hand of $1 million. As of March 31, 2003, Black Box had cash and cash equivalents of $14 million and current and long-term debt of $50 million, for a net debt position of $36 million. This compares to March 31, 2002 cash and cash equivalents of $13 million and current and long-term debt of $78 million, for a net debt position of $65 million. The Company also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of 5 cents per share of common stock. The dividend was declared on all outstanding shares of Black Box's common stock and will be payable on July 15, 2003 to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 30, 2003. Black Box will pay the dividend through its transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company. The Board of Directors also approved an increase of one million shares under the existing Black Box common share repurchase program. The one million shares of the Company's stock represent approximately 5% of the current outstanding shares. With this increase, Black Box now has authorization to repurchase approximately 1,680,000 shares. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003, Black Box repurchased 755,000 shares of its common stock, and since April 1999 has repurchased in aggregate approximately 3.8 million shares for approximately $164 million. Additional repurchases of stock may occur from time to time depending upon factors such as the Company's cash flows and general market conditions. While the Company expects to continue to repurchase shares for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of such repurchases. The Company also announced that Thomas W. Golonski was elected to its Board of Directors in February 2003, increasing its board membership to six directors. Mr. Golonski has been Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of National City Bank of Pennsylvania and Executive Vice President of National City Corporation since 1996. He has served most of his career in the banking industry. Mr. Golonski is also a director of several economic development organizations and active in other charitable and financial organizations. Commenting on Mr. Golonski's election as a Director, Fred C. Young, Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are very fortunate to have Tom join the Black Box Board of Directors. He brings a wealth of executive management expertise, particularly in the services industry. Tom also works under a very high set of business standards." Commenting on his election to the Black Box Board of Directors, Mr. Golonski said, "Black Box's outstanding commitment to customer service and achievement of core business objectives coupled with an outstanding management team sets it apart from the competition. I'm delighted for the opportunity to become a part of this professional team." Commenting on the fourth quarter and total year Fiscal 2003 results, Mr. Young, said, "As stated in our March 11, 2003 press release, global over capacity in just about all vertical markets, leading to more associated job cuts, continues to have an impact on our business. We need to exercise prudent judgment to successfully navigate our business through these very uncertain economic times. This demands a focus on client service, remaining financially strong and continuing to make strategic investments for the future. We have built the best infrastructure services model in the industry. Once the economy settles down, Black Box is well positioned for long-term growth." The Company will conduct a conference call beginning at 10:45 a.m. Eastern Time today, May 7, 2003. Fred Young, Chief Executive Officer, will host the call.

Exhibit 99.1 Black Box Corporation Reports First Quarter Fiscal 2004 Results PITTSBURGH, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 22, 2003--Black Box Corporation (Nasdaq:BBOX) today reported for the first quarter ended June 29, 2003, diluted earnings per share of 60 cents compared to 70 cents last year, down 14%. Corresponding reported net income for the quarter was $11.5 million or 9.0% of revenues, compared to $14.7 million or 9.5% of revenues last year. Total revenues for the quarter were $128 million, down 17% from $154 million last year. North American revenues were $86 million, down 20% from last year's $108 million. European revenues were $34 million, down 7% from last year's $36 million. All Other revenues were $8 million, down 20% from last year's $10 million. First quarter cash provided by operating activities was $14 million or 123% of net income, compared to $19 million or 132% of net income last year. Free cash flow was $16 million compared to $24 million last year. The first quarter's free cash flow of $16 million was used towards: Black Box stock repurchases of $14 million; dividend payments of $1 million; and merger activity of $1 million. The Company also used $5 million of cash on hand for additional stock repurchases during the quarter. Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available for stock repurchases, mergers, dividend payments or debt reduction. In accordance with SEC Regulation G, the attached financial charts include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Commenting on the first quarter results, Mr. Young, said, "Although revenues were down, Black Box remains operationally and financially strong. This is a direct result of our commitment and demonstrated ability to properly size our cost structure. At the current level of revenues we are pleased with our overall operating performance, and particularly, with net income at 9% of revenues and operating cash flow of $14 million, or 123% of net income. In addition, we continue to fund our strategic growth initiatives." Mr. Young went on to say, "These strategic growth initiatives are focused both on increasing market share in existing markets and developing new markets. Specific examples would include our innovative One Source for Worldwide Infrastructure Program and our recently announced In-Home Networking Partnership Program. Although the world economy remains challenging, Black Box remains well positioned for future long-term profitable growth." The Company will conduct a conference call beginning at 10:45 a.m. Eastern Time today, July 22, 2003. Fred Young, Chief Executive Officer, will host the call. To participate in the call, please dial (612) 326-1011 approximately 15 minutes prior to the starting time and ask to be connected to the Black Box Earnings Call.

Exhibit 99.1 Black Box Corporation Reports Fourth Quarter and Total Year Fiscal 2004 Results PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 19, 2004--Black Box Corporation (Nasdaq:BBOX) today reported for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2004, diluted earnings per share of 61 cents compared to 21 cents last year. Net income for the fourth quarter was $11.5 million or 8.9% of revenues, compared to $4.2 million or 3.1% of revenues last year. On a sequential comparison basis, third quarter diluted earnings per share were 66 cents with corresponding net income of $12.2 million or 9.2% of revenues. Included in the FY04 fourth quarter earnings per share is a 4 cents negative impact from an award in an arbitration matter that has been resolved. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $130 million, down 4% from $135 million last year. On a sequential comparison basis, third quarter revenues were $133 million. Fourth quarter cash provided by operating activities was $27 million or 231% of net income, compared to $27 million or 636% of net income last year. Fourth quarter free cash flow was $42 million compared to $25 million last year. On a sequential comparison basis, third quarter cash provided by operating activities was $16 million and free cash flow was $19 million. The fourth quarter's free cash flow of $42 million was used towards: Black Box stock repurchases of $29 million; debt reduction of $11 million; dividend payments of $1 million; and merger obligations of $1 million. Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company. In accordance with SEC Regulation G, the attached financial chart includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. For total fiscal year 2004, diluted earnings per share were $2.52 compared to $2.39 last year, up 5%. Corresponding net income for the year was $47.2 million or 9.1% of revenues, compared to $48.7 million or 8.0% of revenues last year. Total year revenues were $520 million, down 14% from $605 million last year. Cash provided by operating activities for the year was $75 million or 159% of net income, compared to $93 million or 190% of net income last year. Free cash flow was $97 million, comparable to last year's $97 million. The total year free cash flow of $97 million and $5 million of cash on hand was used towards: payments for Black Box stock repurchases of $81 million; debt reduction of $14 million; dividend payments of $4 million; and merger obligations of $3 million. The Company's 6-month order backlog was $56 million at March 31, 2004 compared to $54 million at the end of the third quarter. Commenting on the total year results, Fred C. Young, Chief Executive Officer, said, "Revenues for FY04 proved to be relatively stable throughout the year, although down 14% from FY03. Corresponding net income was down 3%, as we offset this revenue decline with good cost control and without the need for restructuring charges. As a percent of revenues, net income increased from 8.0% to 9.1%. On the strength of our operating profits and stock repurchase program, diluted earnings per share increased 5% from $2.39 to $2.52. Cash flow remained very strong in absolute amounts and relative to net income." The Company has entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement in the case captioned In Re Black Box Corporation Securities Litigation (Civil Action No. 03-CV-412). This preliminary settlement provides for the payment of $2 million into a settlement fund, an amount within the limits of the Company's directors' and officers' liability policy, most of which will be covered under such policy. This payment is in exchange for a full and complete release of any and all claims against defendants. The settlement is subject to (1) plaintiffs' counsel determining, through limited confirmatory discovery, that the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate, (2) the notice and hearing procedures that pertain to federal court class actions and (3) final approval of the court. The Company also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of 5 cents per share of common stock. The dividend was declared on all outstanding shares of Black Box's common stock and will be payable on July 15, 2004 to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 30, 2004. Black Box will pay the dividend through its transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company. Beginning with its August 2004 dividend declaration, the Company expects to increase its current annual dividend payment rate of 20 cents by 20% to 24 cents per share. During FY04, the Company repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $76 million. Funding for the stock repurchases came primarily from cash flow from operations. Since inception of the repurchase program in April 1999 through March 31, 2004, the Company has repurchased in aggregate approximately 5.5 million shares for $240 million. Throughout FY05, the Company expects to repurchase approximately 1 million additional shares. Repurchases of stock during FY05 will occur from time to time depending upon factors such as the Company's cash flows and general market conditions. While the Company expects to continue to repurchase shares for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of such repurchases. The Company also announced that current director Thomas G. Greig will serve as non-executive Chairman of the Board. Mr. Fred Young, along with his CEO position, formerly served as Chairman. Mr. Greig has been serving on the Black Box Board since August 1999 and remains an independent director. The Company believes this is a stronger commitment to contemporary governance guidelines than simply naming a lead director. With a current Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) industry ranking Corporate Governance Quotient score of 86 (meaning that, according to ISS, Black Box currently outperforms 86% of the companies in the technology hardware and equipment group relative to corporate governance), the Company remains committed to its overall corporate governance program and its associated leadership position. In summary, Mr. Young stated, "As we look forward, we will remain focused on continued overall financial stability. In addition, we remain committed to achieving long-term 'green growth', i.e., revenue growth that has high client value-add and the right profit and cash flow characteristics. We will look to strategically add revenue streams that might not immediately meet our traditional metrics, but only where we believe this revenue will eventually meet such criteria. From a marketing and operational perspective, we will stay true to the consistent execution of our world-class technical support services - the combination of data, voice and hot-line services." The Company will conduct a conference call beginning at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time today, May 19, 2004. Fred Young, Chief Executive Officer, will host the call. To participate in the call, please dial 612-326-1003 approximately 15 minutes prior to the starting time and ask to be connected to the Black Box Earnings Call. A replay of the conference call will be available for one week after the teleconference by dialing 320-365-3844 and using access code 728699. The Company expects to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, June 14, 2004. Its Annual Report and Proxy Statement is expected to be mailed at the end of June 2004 to stockholders of record as of June 11, 2004. The Company's Annual Stockholders Meeting will be held in Pittsburgh, PA on Tuesday, August 10, 2004, commencing at 12:30 p.m. EDT.

Exhibit 99.1 Black Box Corporation Reports First Quarter Fiscal 2005 Results PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 27, 2004--Black Box Corporation (Nasdaq:BBOX) today reported for the first quarter ended July 3, 2004 diluted earnings per share of 54 cents compared to 60 cents last year. Net income for the first quarter was $10.0 million or 8.0% of revenues, compared to $11.5 million or 9.0% of revenues last year. On a sequential comparison basis, fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were 61 cents with corresponding net income of $11.5 million or 8.9% of revenues. Total revenues for the first quarter were $124.4 million, down 3% from $128.3 million last year. On a sequential comparison basis, fourth quarter revenues were $129.7 million. First quarter cash provided by operating activities was $9 million or 92% of net income, compared to $14 million or 123% of net income last year. On a sequential comparison basis, fourth quarter cash provided by operating activities was $27 million. Black Box utilized $1 million of the cash from operations for the quarter to make a dividend payment and utilized the remaining $8 million, together with $17 million from other sources of cash, to repurchase $25 million of its Common Stock. The Company's 6-month order backlog was $53 million at July 3, 2004 compared to $56 million at the end of March 2004. Commenting on the first quarter results, Fred C. Young, Chief Executive Officer, said, "Revenues of $124 million were down sequentially due primarily to one specific large client delaying for 90 days certain previously scheduled IT projects of approximately $3 million and a negative impact of currency translation of approximately $1 million. Gross profit percentage of 41.7% remained strong and consistent with previous quarters. Although operating expense dollars were down sequentially, the corresponding operating expense percentage of 28.9% was up due to the lower revenues and additional professional services incurred relating to year-end auditing activities. Operating cash flow of $9 million was consistent with net income of $10 million." Mr. Young continued, "Relative to our second quarter, we currently expect revenues to be within a range of $127 to $129 million based on typical US government spending cycles and the return to a historical spend level with the previously-mentioned large client. Gross profit is expected to be in the 41% to 42% range. Total operating expenses are expected to be in the 27.5% to 28% range. "Operating cash flow should remain strong and increase to $12 to $15 million based on earnings and incremental working capital improvements. We will continue our stock repurchase program subject to continued business stability and at levels consistent with operating cash flow generation. "In summary, although we had to deal with a few short-term impacts in our first quarter, the fundamental business model remains strong. And this includes our main focus centered around profitable 'green growth' for Black Box's world-class technical support services." Relative to corporate governance, the Company received an updated Corporate Governance Quotient provided by Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) as of July 20, 2004. In summary, this update highlighted that the Company now outperforms 88.8% of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 600 and 95.6% of the companies in the technology hardware and equipment group. Mr. Young commented, "Black Box is proud to remain in a leadership position in this important area."

ITEM 4. CHANGE IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT. - ------------------------------------------------------ On August 6, 2004, Ernst and Young LLP ("E&Y") informed Black Box Corporation (the "Company") that it will resign as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company upon completion of its review of the interim financial information for the Company's second fiscal quarter ending October 2, 2004 and the filing of the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for such period. The reports of E&Y on the Company's financial statements for the past two fiscal years ended March 31, 2003 and 2004 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. The Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors was not required to take any action regarding the resignation. The Audit Committee has commenced a search for a new independent auditing firm. During the two most recent fiscal years and through August 10, 2004, the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K ("this Form 8-K"), there were no disagreements with E&Y on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of E&Y, would have caused them to make reference thereto in their report on the financial statements for such years. During the two most recent fiscal years and through August 10, 2004, the date of this Form 8-K, there were no reportable events (as defined in Regulation S-K Item 304 (a)(1)(v)), except as previously disclosed in Item 9A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and which is incorporated herein by reference. The Company has requested that E&Y furnish it with a letter addressed to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether E&Y agrees with the above statements. A copy of that letter, dated August 10, 2004, is attached as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K. ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS. - ------------------------------------------- (c) Exhibits.

EXHIBIT INDEX ------------- Exhibit Number Description -------------- ----------- 16.1 Letter from Ernst & Young LLP to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission dated August 10, 2004. 99.1 Item 9A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. 4

Exhibit 16.1 August 10, 2004 Securities and Exchange Commission 450 Fifth Street, N.W. Washington, DC 20549 Gentlemen: We have read Item 4 of Form 8-K dated August 10, 2004 of Black Box Corporation and are in agreement with the statements contained in paragraphs 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 on page 2 therein. We have no basis to agree or disagree with other statements of the registrant contained therein. Regarding the registrant's statement concerning the reportable event (as defined in Regulation S-K Item 304 (a)(1)(v)), as disclosed in Item 9A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, included in the fifth paragraph on page 2 therein, we had considered such matter in determining the nature, timing and extent of procedures performed in our audit of the registrant's 2004 financial statements. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Ernst & Young LLP

Exhibit 99.1 ITEM 9A - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES An evaluation was performed, under the supervision and with the participation of Company management, including the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Act")). Based on that evaluation, taking into account the recent report of the Company's independent public accountants to the audit committee of the Company's board of directors and other reports to the audit committee summarized below, management, including the CEO and CFO, has concluded that, as of March 31, 2004, except for the matters reported by Ernst & Young LLP ("E&Y"), the Company's independent accountants, to management and the audit committee discussed in the next paragraph, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that the Company files or submits under the Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in accordance with the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the fourth fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2004, there had been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting, except for certain matters set forth in the last paragraph of this Item 9A. As set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report, E&Y issued an unqualified opinion with respect to the financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. However, in connection with its fiscal year end audit procedures, E&Y reported to management and to the audit committee that the combination of identified reportable conditions under standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, internal control deficiencies at the Company relating primarily to the internal control environment, the risk assessment process and the monitoring process that assesses the quality of the Company's internal control performance, which have been separately reported to the audit committee, and year-end audit adjustments constitute a material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting. E&Y has advised the Company, however, that none of these conditions or concerns individually constitutes a material weakness. Management and the audit committee believe that neither the matters reflected in the reportable conditions nor the other deficiencies involving internal control, individually or in the aggregate, had a material effect on the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. In addition, management and the audit committee believe that no identified audit adjustments, all of which were reflected in the reported financial statements, that affected income and balance sheet classification had a material effect on the financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 or prior fiscal years. The matters involving reportable conditions and other internal control deficiencies have been discussed in detail among management, the audit committee of the Company's board of directors and E&Y. Management will evaluate the specific reportable conditions and other internal control deficiencies identified by E&Y and will develop, in consultation with E&Y and under the
direction of the audit committee, measures to enhance internal control systems and procedures. The Company is taking actions to permit it to comply timely with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ("SOX") in respect of its internal control over financial reporting for fiscal year 2005, including the engagement of another independent accounting firm to assist it with respect to SOX 404 compliance measures, has added additional accounting resources, plans to establish an internal audit function reporting to the audit committee and will take such other remedial measures that may be recommended by the audit committee. In addition to increased oversight by the audit committee, the board of directors has appointed a non-executive chairman of the board, as previously disclosed, and has nominated for election to the board of directors an individual who has significant public accounting experience. 2

Exhibit 99.1 Black Box Corporation Reports Second Quarter and YTD Fiscal 2005 Results PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2004--Black Box Corporation (Nasdaq:BBOX) today reported for the second quarter ended October 2, 2004 diluted earnings per share of 60 cents compared to 64 cents last year. Net income for the second quarter was $10.6 million or 8.4% of revenues, compared to $12.1 million or 9.3% of revenues last year. On a sequential comparison basis, first quarter diluted earnings per share were 54 cents with corresponding net income of $10.0 million or 8.0% of revenues. Included in the FY05 second quarter earnings per share is a 2 cents negative impact from the previously disclosed settlement of a securities class action matter. Total revenues for the second quarter were $127 million, down 2% from $129 million for the same period last year. On a sequential comparison basis, first quarter revenues were $124 million. Second quarter cash provided by operating activities was approximately $11 million or 108% of net income, compared to $16 million or 132% of net income for the same period last year. On a sequential comparison basis, first quarter cash provided by operating activities was $9 million. Black Box utilized its second quarter cash provided by operating activities of $11 million, together with $3 million from other sources of cash, to make a dividend payment of $1 million and repurchase $13 million of its Common Stock. For the six months ended October 2, 2004, diluted earnings per share were $1.14 compared to $1.24 for the same period last year, down 8%. Corresponding net income for the six-month period was $21 million or 8.2% of revenues, compared to $24 million or 9.1% of revenues for the same period last year. Total six-month revenues were $251 million, down 3% from $258 million for the same period last year. Cash provided by operating activities for the six-month period was $21 million or 100% of net income, compared to $31 million or 130% of net income last year. Black Box utilized the six-month cash provided by operating activities of $21 million, together with $19 million from other sources of cash, to make dividend payments of $2 million and repurchase $38 million of its Common Stock. The Company's 6-month order backlog was $55 million at October 2, 2004 compared to $53 million at the end of the first quarter. Commenting on the second quarter results, Fred C. Young, Chief Executive Officer, said, "Sequential total revenues of $127 million were up from our first quarter's $124 million. This is the sixth consecutive quarter we have generated revenues within a fairly tight range around this number. Relative to our expected range of $127 million to $129 million, less revenues from Europe were the difference towards reaching the upper end of this range. Overall profits at $11 million and corresponding cash flow from operations at $11 million remained strong. Relative to areas of improvement, we are focused in on raising our Data Services gross profit by 2 to 3 percentage points over the next twelve months." Mr. Young continued, "With our operational stability and strong financial performance, we are turning more of our resources towards selected growth programs. This is in respect to both organic and merger related growth. We believe more scale helps us operate even more efficiently and further increases our benchmark levels of customer satisfaction." The Company also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of 6 cents per share of common stock. The dividend was declared on all outstanding shares of Black Box's common stock and will be payable on January 14, 2005 to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 31, 2004. Black Box will pay the dividend through its transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company.

Item 1.01
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On December 20, 2004, Black Box Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Black Box"), SF Acquisition Co., a Minnesota corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Black Box ("Purchaser"), and Norstan, Inc., a Minnesota corporation ("Norstan" or the "Company"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement").
     Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Purchaser will commence a tender offer (the "Offer") for all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, $0.10 par value per share (the "Company Common Stock"), of Norstan, including the associated common stock purchase rights (the "Rights" and together with the Company Common Stock, the "Shares" and each share thereof, a "Share"), at a price equal to $5.60 per Share net to the seller in cash (or any higher price per Share paid in the Offer) (the "Per-Share Amount"), without interest (and subject to applicable withholding taxes). Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, following a successful completion of the Offer, Purchaser will be merged with and into Norstan with Norstan surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Black Box (the "Merger"). In the Merger, each Share (other than Shares owned by Black Box, Purchaser, or shareholders, if any, who have perfected statutory dissenters' rights under Minnesota law) will be converted into the right to receive the Per-Share Amount, without interest (and subject to applicable withholding taxes).
     The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, there being validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer that number of Shares, together with any Shares then owned by Black Box or Purchaser (including Shares subject to the Tender Agreement, discussed below), that, immediately prior to acceptance for payment pursuant to the Offer, represents at least a majority of the sum of (a) the aggregate number of Shares immediately prior to acceptance for payment, plus (b) the aggregate number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of any option, warrant, other right to acquire capital stock of the Company, or other security exercisable for or convertible into Shares or other capital stock of the Company, any of which is outstanding immediately prior to acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer. Additional conditions to the Offer are set forth in Annex I to the Merger Agreement.
     A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.
     Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Black Box also entered into a Tender and Voting Agreement, dated as of December 20, 2004 (the "Tender Agreement"), with Purchaser and all of the directors and executive officers of Norstan (the "Shareholders"). As of December 20, 2004, the Shareholders collectively owned 636,019 Shares, excluding unvested shares of restricted stock (approximately 5% of the Shares) directly or through affiliates. The Shareholders have agreed to tender all of the Shares that each of them owns, including any Shares which such Shareholder acquires ownership of after the date of the Tender Agreement and prior to the termination of the Tender Agreement, to Purchaser in the Offer. The Tender Agreement also grants each of Black Box and Purchaser an irrevocable option to purchase each outstanding Share owned by the Shareholders at the Per-Share Amount. Black Box or Purchaser may exercise this option at any time after the expiration of the Offer and until the earlier of the effectiveness of the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms. Furthermore, each Shareholder has agreed, at any meeting of the shareholders of Norstan, to vote all Shares (a) in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement and any transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (b) against any alternative transaction proposal and (c) against any action that would delay, prevent or frustrate the Offer and the Merger and the related transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The number of Shares subject to the foregoing restrictions may not exceed 19.9% of the Shares.
     A copy of the Tender Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.
     Pursuant to a Stock Option Agreement, dated as of December 20, 2004, by and among Black Box, Purchaser and Norstan (the "Option Agreement"), the Company has granted to Purchaser an irrevocable option to purchase at the Per-Share Amount that certain number of Shares as is necessary for Purchaser to obtain ownership of at least 90% of the Shares on an as-converted, fully-diluted basis. Purchaser's exercise of this option is conditioned upon Purchaser and Black Box owning in the aggregate, immediately preceding such exercise, at least 80% of the Shares, and immediately following such exercise, at least 90% of the Shares. Purchaser may exercise this option at any time, or from time to time, after the expiration of the Offer until the earlier of (i) immediately following the effectiveness of the Merger or (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms.
     A copy of the Option Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated by reference herein.

     This Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement") is made and entered into on this 20th day of December, 2004, by and among Norstan, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (the "Company"), Black Box Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and SF Acquisition Co., a Minnesota corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Acquisition Co.").
     A. The respective boards of directors of Parent, Acquisition Co. and the Company have each determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of their respective shareholders for Parent to acquire the Company; and for such purpose have each approved a merger (the "Merger") of Acquisition Co. with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation, upon the terms and conditions set forth herein.
     B. In furtherance of the Merger, it has been agreed that Acquisition Co. will make a cash tender offer (the "Offer") to acquire all of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock, $.10 par value per share (the "Company Common Stock") and the Rights (as defined in Section 3.2(a) below) for $5.60 per share (such amount or any greater amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer, subject to Section 1.1(f), is hereinafter referred to as the "Per-Share Amount"), without interest, upon the terms and conditions set forth herein.
     C. By resolutions duly adopted, the Company's board of directors has, in light of and subject to the terms and conditions hereof: (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, specifically including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders; and (ii) resolved to recommend that the Company's shareholders accept the Offer and tender their shares and the Rights pursuant thereto, and adopt this Agreement.
     D. The Special Committee (as defined in Section 1.2(a) below) has unanimously approved the Offer and the Merger, this Agreement, the Tender and Voting Agreement (as defined in paragraph E below), the Acquisition Co. Option Agreement (as defined in paragraph F below) and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, in order to render Sections 302A.671, 302A.673 and 302A.675 of the MBCA (as defined in Section 1.2(a) below) inapplicable to the Offer and the Merger, this Agreement, the Tender and Voting Agreement, the Acquisition Co. Option Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
     E. To induce Parent and Acquisition Co. to enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company's executive officers and directors are executing one or more Tender and Voting Agreements in favor of Parent and Acquisition Co. (collectively, the "Tender and Voting Agreement") concurrently with the execution and delivery hereof.
     F. To further induce Parent and Acquisition Co. to enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, Acquisition Co. and the Company are executing a Stock Option Agreement (the "Acquisition Co. Option Agreement"), pursuant to
 
which the Company has granted Acquisition Co. an option to purchase authorized but unissued shares of Company Common Stock, subject to certain conditions.
     Now, Therefore, in consideration of the foregoing premises hereby made a part of this Agreement, the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein, hereby agree as follows:

Acquisition Co.'s obligation to accept for payment and to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to:
               (i) the condition that there shall be a number of shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and not withdrawn, together with shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, including shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Tender and Voting Agreement (such shares owned by Parent and/or subject to the Tender and Voting Agreement being referred to as the "Parent-Owned Shares"), that, immediately prior to the acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, represents at least a majority of the Fully Diluted Number of Company Shares (as defined in paragraph (d) below) (the "Minimum Condition"); and
               (ii) the other conditions set forth in Annex I.
               Acquisition Co. expressly reserves the right in its sole discretion to increase the initial Per-Share Amount, to waive (in whole or in part) any of the conditions of the Offer set forth in Annex I, or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; , that without the Company's prior written consent: (1) the Minimum Condition may not be amended or waived; (2) no change may be made that alters the form of consideration to be

     (c) For all purposes of this Agreement, the capitalized terms set forth below shall have the following meanings:
               (i) "Law" shall mean any federal, state, local or foreign law, statute, ordinance, regulation, guidelines, ruling or requirement issued, enacted, adopted, promulgated, implemented or otherwise put into effect by or under the authority of any Governmental Body (or under the authority of the Nasdaq National Market System or New York Stock Exchange).
               (ii) "Governmental Body" shall mean any (a) nation, state, commonwealth, province, territory, county, municipality, district or other jurisdiction of any nature, (b) federal, state, local or foreign government, or (c) governmental authority.
               (iii) "Entity" shall mean any corporation, general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, joint venture, estate, trust, company (including any company limited by shares, limited liability company or joint stock company), firm, society or other enterprise, association, organization or entity.

     (d) The Offer shall initially expire 20 business days following the date of the commencement thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein but subject to the parties' respective termination rights under Section 8.1: (i) if, at any then-scheduled expiration date of the Offer, any of the conditions to the Offer have not been satisfied or waived, Acquisition Co., without the consent of the Company or any other Person, shall be entitled to extend the Offer for such amount of time as is reasonably necessary to cause such conditions to the Offer to be satisfied; (ii) Acquisition Co. may, without the consent of the Company or any other Person (A) extend the Offer (one or more times) for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") applicable to the Offer and (B) if the sum of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that shall have been validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (other than shares tendered by guaranteed delivery where actual delivery has not occurred) as of the then-scheduled expiration date of the Offer, plus (2) the number of Parent-Owned Shares as of such date, plus (3) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that Acquisition Co. could acquire under the Acquisition Co. Option Agreement as of such date, equals more than a majority of the Fully Diluted Number of Company Shares (as defined below) but less than 90% of the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding as of such date, extend the Offer (one or more times) for an aggregate additional period of not more than 20 business days; (iii) Acquisition Co. may, without the consent of the Company or any other Person, elect to
 
provide for a subsequent offering period (and one or more extensions thereof) pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act; and (iv) if, at any then-scheduled expiration date of the Offer, any of the conditions to the Offer have not been satisfied or waived, Acquisition Co. shall, if the Company so requests in writing, extend the Offer for ten business days; , that Acquisition Co. shall not be required to extend the expiration date more than one time pursuant to this clause (iv).
provided, however
     For purposes of this Agreement, "Fully Diluted Number of Company Shares" shall mean the sum of the (x) aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the acceptance of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, plus (y) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of any option, warrant, other right to acquire capital stock of the Company or other security exercisable for or convertible into shares of Company Common Stock or other capital stock of the Company, any of which is outstanding immediately prior to the acceptance of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer.
     (e) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Acquisition Co. shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer which will contain or incorporate by reference the offer to purchase shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and form of the related letter of transmittal and (ii) cause the offer to purchase and related documents to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Parent and Acquisition Co. agree that they shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule TO and all exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto (collectively, the "Offer Documents") to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable Law. Each of Parent, Acquisition Co. and the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer, to correct promptly any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as supplemented or amended to correct such information to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Acquisition Co. all information concerning the Company and the Company's shareholders that may be required or reasonably requested in connection with any action contemplated by this Section 1.1(e). The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents (including any amendment thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and Acquisition Co. agree to provide the Company and its counsel with any comments Parent, Acquisition Co. or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments.
     (f) If, between the date of this Agreement and the date on which any particular share of Company Common Stock is accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division, subdivision or combination of shares, stock dividend, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Per-Share Amount shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change or transaction. For
 
avoidance of doubt, it is understood that the Company shall not have the right to take any such action with respect to the Company Common Stock without the prior written consent of Parent.
     1.2 Company Actions.  The Company hereby approves and consents to the Offer and represents that its board of directors, at a meeting duly called and held or pursuant to unanimous written action, has: (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, specifically including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders; (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, in accordance with the requirements of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act ("MBCA"), (iii) resolved to recommend that shareholders of the Company accept the Offer and tender their shares of Company Common Stock and the Rights pursuant to the Offer and adopt and approve this Agreement and the Merger (the "Company Board Recommendation"), (iv) approved the Tender and Voting Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and (v) approved the Acquisition Co.

Option Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Offer and the Merger, not to be subject to any state takeover law or similar Law, including, without limitation, Sections 302A.671, 302A.673 and 302A.675 of the MBCA, that might otherwise apply to the Offer or the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Tender and Voting Agreement or the Acquisition Co. Option Agreement. Finally, the Company represents that its board of directors and/or compensation committee thereof has adopted any necessary resolutions to provide for the treatment of Company Options (as defined in Section 3.2(b) below) as set forth in Section 2.5(b) of this Agreement. Subject to Section 5.3, the Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents.
     (b) As promptly as practicable on the day that the Offer is commenced, the Company shall file with the SEC and (following or contemporaneously with the dissemination of the Offer Documents and related documents) disseminate to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that shall reflect, subject to Section 5.3, the Company Board Recommendation. The Company agrees that it shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable Law. Each of Parent, Acquisition Co. and the Company agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as supplemented or amended to correct such information to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. The Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel
 
with any comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments.
     (c) The Company will, or will cause its transfer agent to, promptly furnish Parent and Acquisition Co. with a list of its shareholders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of all record holders of shares of Company Common Stock and lists of securities positions of shares of Company Common Stock held in stock depositories, in each case as of the most recent practicable date, and will provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists of shareholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent or Acquisition Co. may reasonably request in connection with the Offer and the Merger. Parent and Acquisition Co. and their agents shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files, will use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, will, upon request, deliver to the Company or destroy (as requested), and will use their reasonable best efforts to cause their agents to deliver to the Company or destroy (as requested), all copies and any extracts or summaries from such information then in their possession or control.
     (d) Parent and Acquisition Co. agree to promptly file with the Commissioner of Commerce of the State of Minnesota any registration statement relating to the Offer required to be filed pursuant to Chapter 80B of the Minnesota Statutes. Parent and Acquisition Co. shall deliver to all offerees the information contained in any such registration statement relating to the Offer required to be filed pursuant to Chapter 80B of the Minnesota Statutes as required by Chapter 80B of the Minnesota Statutes.
     1.3 Directors.  Effective upon the fulfillment of the Minimum Condition and upon the acceptance for payment of the shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company's board of directors that equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company's board of directors (giving effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant to this Section) and (ii) a fraction whose numerator is the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock then beneficially owned by Parent or Acquisition Co. (including shares of Company Common Stock accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer), and whose denominator is the total number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding, and the Company shall take all commercially reasonable actions necessary to cause Parent's designees to be elected or appointed to the Company's board of directors, including increasing the number of directors, and seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent directors. At such time, to the extent requested by Parent, the Company will also use its reasonable best efforts (i) to cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the next whole number, on each committee of the Company's board of directors, that represents the same percentage as the individuals designated by Parent represent on the board of directors of the Company and (ii) to cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute all of the members of the board of directors of each Subsidiary (as defined in Section 3.1 below) and each committee thereof. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 1.3, the parties hereto shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause at least two of the members of the Company's board of directors, at all times prior to the Effective Time, to be individuals who were directors of the Company and were not officers or employees of the Company or any Subsidiary on the date hereof and who
 
each meet the requirements for being considered "disinterested" under Section 302A.673 of the MBCA (the "Continuing Directors"); , that if at any time prior to the Effective Time there shall be in office only one Continuing Director for any reason, the Company's board of directors shall cause a person who is not an officer or employee of the Company or any Subsidiary designated by the remaining Continuing Director to fill such vacancy (and such person shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for all purposes of this Agreement), and if at any time prior to the Effective Time no Continuing Directors then remain, the other directors of the Company then in office shall use their reasonable best efforts to designate two persons to fill such vacancies who are not officers or employees or affiliates of the Company, its Subsidiaries, Parent or Acquisition Co. or any of their respective affiliates and who each meet the requirements for being considered "disinterested" under Section 302A.673 of the MBCA (and such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for all purposes of this Agreement).
provided, however
     (b) The Company's obligations to appoint Parent's designees to the Company's board of directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 of the Exchange Act require in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section, so long as Parent shall have furnished to the Company on a timely basis the information with respect to Parent and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 of the Exchange Act. The provisions of this Section 1.3 are in addition to and shall not limit any rights which Acquisition Co., Parent or any of their affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock as a matter of applicable Law with respect to the election of directors or otherwise.
     (c) Following the election or appointment of Parent's designees pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors, or a single Continuing Director if there be only one such Continuing Director, shall be required to authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Company's board of directors and no other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize) any termination of this Agreement by the Company, any amendment of this Agreement requiring action by the Company's board of directors, any extension of time for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Acquisition Co. requiring the consent of the Company, any waiver of compliance by the Company of any of the agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company or its shareholders, any required or permitted consent or action by the board of directors of the Company hereunder and any other action of the Company hereunder which adversely affects in any material respect the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Parent or Acquisition Co.).
     2.1 Merger of Acquisition Co. into the Company.
     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the MBCA, at the Effective Time, Acquisition Co. shall be merged with and
 
into the Company, the separate existence of Acquisition Co. shall cease and the Company will continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").
     2.2 Effect of Merger.
     The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the MBCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all property of the Company and Acquisition Co. shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of the Company and Acquisition Co. shall become debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of the Surviving Corporation.
     2.3 Closing; Effective Time.
     Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been abandoned pursuant to ARTICLE 8, the consummation of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place by mutual release of Closing documents followed by overnight delivery of originals, on a date to be designated by Parent (the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the fifth business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE 7 (other than delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing and other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to the delivery of such items and the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, articles of merger satisfying the applicable requirements of the MBCA shall be duly executed by the Company and Acquisition Co. and, concurrently with or as soon as practicable following the Closing, filed with the office of the Minnesota Secretary of State. The Merger shall become effective upon the date and time of the filing of such articles of merger with the Minnesota Secretary of State, or at such later time as is specified therein (the "Effective Time").
     2.4 Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers.
     Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time:
     (a) subject to Section 6.4(a), the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to the articles of incorporation of Acquisition Co. as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time until thereafter changed or amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Law;
     (b) subject to Section 6.4(a), the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to the bylaws of Acquisition Co. as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time until thereafter changed or amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Law;
     (c) the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are directors of Acquisition Co. immediately prior to the Effective Time until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be; and
 
     (d) the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are officers of Acquisition Co. immediately prior to the Effective Time until the earliest of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.
     2.5 Conversion of Shares.
     (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Co., the Company or any shareholder of the Company:
               (i) all shares of Company Common Stock then held by the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;
               (ii) all shares of Company Common Stock, if any, then held by Parent, Acquisition Co. or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;
               (iii) except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above and subject to Sections 2.5(d) and 2.7, each share of Company Common Stock then outstanding shall be converted into the right to receive the Per-Share Amount (the "Merger Consideration"), without interest; and
               (iv) all of the shares of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Acquisition Co. then outstanding shall be converted into one share of Company Common Stock.
     (b) All Company Options (as defined in Section 3.2(b) below) and Warrants (as defined in Section 3.2(c) below) shall terminate as of the Effective Time, whether or not vested or exercisable and without regard to any agreements qualifying the right to retain or exercise any such Company Options or Warrants. At the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions set forth below in this Section 2.5(b), each holder of a Company Option or Warrant will be entitled to receive from the Company, and shall receive, in settlement of each Company Option or Warrant a "Cash Amount." The "Cash Amount" shall be equal to the net amount of (A) the product of the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Option or Warrant at the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares subject to such Company Option or Warrant, less (B) any applicable withholdings for Tax (as defined in Section 3.17 below). If the exercise price per share of any Company Option or Warrant equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, the Cash Amount therefor shall be zero. Except as may be otherwise agreed to by Parent and the Company, all of the Company's Stock Option Plans (as defined in Section 3.2 below) shall terminate as of the Effective Time and the provisions in any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of Company or any Subsidiary shall be deleted, terminated and of no further force or effect as of the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) payment of the Cash Payment is subject to written acknowledgement, in a form acceptable to the Surviving Corporation, that no further payment is due to such holder on account of any Company Option or Warrant and all of such holder's rights under such Company Options or Warrants have terminated and (ii) with respect to any Person subject to Section 16(a)
 
of the Exchange Act, any Cash Amount to be paid to such Person in accordance with this Section 2.5(b) shall be paid as soon as practicable after the payment can be made without liability to such Person under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.
     (c) The current purchase period under the Company's 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Stock Purchase Plan") will end on December 31, 2004. The Company's board of directors has taken all action so that the Company will not commence any new purchase period under the Stock Purchase Plan commencing as of such date and, as of the Effective Time, the Stock Purchase Plan will terminate and each participant under the Stock Purchase Plan shall receive a cash payment from the Surviving Corporation equal to the balance, if any, of any accumulated payroll deductions, without interest, in the Stock Purchase Plan as of the Effective Time.
     (d) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change or transaction. For avoidance of doubt, it is understood that the Company shall not have the right to take any such action with respect to the Company Common Stock without the prior written consent of Parent.
     2.6 Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books.
     (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "Paying Agent") for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the funds to which holders of such shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.5. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock.
     (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such shares (the "Certificates") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant thereto. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate, and such Certificate shall thereupon be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate for the benefit of the holder of such Certificate. If the payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate formerly evidencing shares of Company Common Stock is registered on the Company's stock transfer
 
books, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction of Acquisition Co. that such Taxes are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.6(b), each Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate.
     (c) At any time following the six-month anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds not then disbursed to holders of shares of Company Common Stock (including without limitation all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all such funds), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent nor any other party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of a share of Company Common Stock for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Body), any amounts payable in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
     (d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the Company's stock transfer books shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of the Company's capital stock. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law.
     (e) Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Acquisition Co. shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold) from the consideration otherwise payable in the Merger to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.
 
     2.7 Dissenters' Rights.
     Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each outstanding share of Company Common Stock, the holder of which has demanded and perfected such holder's right to dissent from the Merger and to be paid the fair value of such shares in accordance with Section 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA and, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such dissenters' rights ("Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5, but the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the MBCA; , that if any holder of Company Common Stock demands dissenters' rights with respect to such shares under the MBCA and subsequently effectively withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) its dissenters' rights, then as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever later occurs, such holder's Company Common Stock will automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.5, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate(s) formerly representing such shares. After the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company to make all payments to holders of Dissenting Shares with respect to such demands in accordance with the MBCA. The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt written notice of any notice of intent to demand fair value for any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such notices, and any other instruments served pursuant to the MBCA and received by the Company; and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for fair value for shares of Company Common Stock under the MBCA. The Company shall not, except with prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for fair value for shares of Company Common Stock or offer to settle or settle any such demands.
provided, however
     2.8 Further Action.
     If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is determined by Parent to be reasonably necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Acquisition Co. and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Acquisition Co., in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.
     Except as set forth in the disclosure schedules attached hereto (it being acknowledged that disclosure in the Company Disclosure Letter with respect to any particular Section of the Agreement shall be deemed disclosure with respect to another Section of the Agreement only if disclosure to the subject matter of such other Section is explicitly referenced in the Company Disclosure Letter or incorporated by reference to a specific section of the Company SEC Documents (as defined in Section 3.8 below) filed on or after January 1, 2004 but prior to the date of this Agreement), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Acquisition Co. that all of the statements contained in this ARTICLE 3 are true and complete as of the date of this Agreement, and will be true and complete as of the expiration date of the Offer as though made
 
at such time and as of the Effective Time as though made at the Effective Time (except as to any representation or warranty that speaks as of a specific date, which shall be true as of such date).
     3.1 Organization.
     (a) The Company and each Subsidiary is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted. The Company and each Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the character of the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would not be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall mean any change, result, effect, event, occurrence or state of facts (or any development that has had or is reasonably likely to have any change or effect) that, alone or in connection with other matters, is or would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the business, financial condition, assets, liabilities or results of operations of the Company or the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or which is or would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the ability of such Persons to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; , that none of the following shall be deemed in itself, either alone or in combination, to constitute, and none of the following shall be taken into account in determining whether there has been, a Company Material Adverse Effect: (i) any effect resulting from or arising in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the execution or announcement hereof, (ii) changes in circumstances or conditions affecting the industry in which the Company and the Subsidiaries operate or affecting telecommunications companies in general other than those matters which have a materially disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and the Subsidiaries as compared to others in the industry in which the Company is engaged, (iii) changes in general economic conditions in the United States, (iv) changes in generally accepted accounting principles or (v) any change in the price at which the shares of Company Common Stock are publicly traded. In addition, the Company's failure to meet any particular revenue or earnings forecast or estimate for any period ending after the date hereof, including estimates prepared by equity analysts or other third parties, as well as internal forecasts prepared by Company management, shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect.
provided, however
     (b) The Company has heretofore made available to Parent accurate and complete copies of the articles of incorporation and bylaws, as currently in effect, of the Company and the Subsidiaries. For purposes of this Agreement, "Subsidiary" shall mean a Subsidiary of the Company and an Entity shall be considered a Subsidiary of the Company if the Company directly or indirectly owns, beneficially or of record, an amount of voting securities of other interests in such Entity that is sufficient to enable the Company to elect at least a majority of the members of such Entity's board of directors or other governing body, or at least 50% of the outstanding equity or financial interests of such Entity. Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Acquired Companies") owns an equity interest in any Entity other than a Subsidiary and none of the Acquired Companies have agreed or is obligated to
 
make, or is bound by any contract or other obligation under which it may become obligated to make, any future equity or similar investment in or capital contribution to any other Person.
     3.2 Capitalization.
     (a) As of the date hereof, the Company's authorized capital stock consists of 40,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock (and the associated rights (the "Rights") to purchase 40,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, dated as of April 1, 1998, by and between the Company and Norwest Bank Minnesota, National Association as Rights Agent (as amended, the "Rights Agreement")). As of the date hereof, 13,821,679 shares of Company Common Stock, along with an equal number of Rights, were issued and outstanding. No other capital stock of the Company is authorized or issued. All issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.

The Company has no plans or arrangements pursuant to which stock options or other stock-based equity may be issued other than the Company's Stock Option Plans. The Company has delivered to Parent and Acquisition Co. accurate and complete copies of all stock plans pursuant to which Company has granted currently outstanding stock options or other stock-based compensation or, could have granted stock options or other stock-based compensation since January 1, 1994 or currently can grant stock options or other stock-based compensation, and the forms of all stock option agreements evidencing such options or other stock-based compensation. Assuming that the Company complies with its obligations under
 
Section 2.5(b), the Company will not incur any liability as a result of the cancellation of the Company Options or Warrants as described in Section 2.5 and all rights of the holders of such Company Options or Warrants will terminate as of the Effective Time.

     (e) Since January 1, 2000, the Company has not repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired any shares of Company Common Stock. All repurchases of the Company Common Stock by the Company have been made in compliance with Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
     3.3 Subsidiaries.
     Each Subsidiary is listed in Schedule 3.3. Each Subsidiary is wholly owned by the Company except as otherwise indicated in Schedule 3.3. All of the capital stock and other interests of the Subsidiaries so held are owned by the Company free and clear of any claim, lien, encumbrance, security interest or agreement with respect thereto. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock in each of the Subsidiaries held by the Company are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and were issued free of preemptive rights and in compliance with applicable Laws. No equity securities or other interests of any of the Subsidiaries are or may become required to be issued or purchased by reason of any options, warrants, rights to subscribe to, puts, calls or commitments of any character whatsoever relating to, or securities or rights convertible into or exchangeable for, shares of any capital stock of any Subsidiary, and there are no contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements by which any Subsidiary is bound to issue additional shares of its capital stock, or options, warrants or rights to purchase or acquire any additional shares of its capital stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares.

Exhibit 10.2
     This Stock Option Agreement is made and entered into as of December 20, 2004, by and among Black Box Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), SF Acquisition Co., a Minnesota corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Acquisition Co."), and Norstan, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (the "Company").
     WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Acquisition Co. are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") of even date herewith providing for (a) a cash tender offer to purchase any and all outstanding shares of (i) common stock, $.10 par value per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock") and the associated Rights (as defined in the Merger Agreement), at the Per-Share Amount, as defined in the Merger Agreement, net to the seller in cash without interest thereon, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (the "Offer"); and (b) the merger (the "Merger") of Acquisition Co. with and into the Company; and
     WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of Parent and Acquisition Co. to enter into the Merger Agreement and commence the Offer, Parent and Acquisition Co. have requested, and the Company has agreed to grant Acquisition Co., the option to purchase, as described herein, authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock.
     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:
     1. Grant of Option. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the Company hereby grants to Acquisition Co. an irrevocable option (the "Option") to purchase for the Per-Share Amount, as defined in the Merger Agreement (the "Purchase Price"), shares of Common Stock, in such relative amounts as shall be determined by Acquisition Co. in its sole and absolute discretion, up to such number of shares which, upon exercise, would result in Acquisition Co. owning in excess of ninety percent (90%) of the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock on an as-converted, fully-diluted basis (collectively, the "Optioned Shares"); provided, that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable under the Option may not exceed the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock.
     2. Exercise of Option. Subject to the two immediately succeeding sentences, the Option may be exercised by Acquisition Co., in whole or in part, at any one time after the Offer Closing Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and until the earlier of (a) immediately following the Closing Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and (b) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms. The exercise of the Option is conditioned upon Acquisition Co. and the Parent owning in the aggregate, immediately following such exercise, at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. The obligation of the Company to deliver the Optioned Shares at the Option Closing is subject to the following conditions: (i) any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act relating to the issuance of the Optioned Shares will have expired or been terminated, (ii) no provision of any applicable law or regulation and no judgment, injunction or decree shall prohibit the exercise of the Option or the
 
delivery of the Optioned Shares in respect of such exercise and (iii) Acquisition Co. shall have accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer shares of Common Stock constituting at least 80% of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In the event Acquisition Co. wishes to exercise the Option, Acquisition Co. shall give a written notice (the "Notice") to the Company of its intention to exercise the Option, specifying the number of Optioned Shares to be purchased. Such notice shall be delivered to the Company in accordance with the requirements of Section 7(d), and shall specify a date (which may be the date of such notice) not more than three (3) business days from the date such Notice is given for the purchase of the Optioned Shares. The closing (the "Option Closing") of the purchase of the Optioned Shares shall take place at the offices of Buchanan Ingersoll PC, 301 Grant Street, One Oxford Centre, 20th Floor, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, or at such other location as Acquisition Co. shall elect. If any decree, injunction, order, law or regulation shall not permit the purchase of the Optioned Shares to be consummated on the date specified in such Notice, the date for the Option Closing shall be as soon as practicable following the cessation of such restriction on consummation, but in any event within two (2) business days thereof, and in no event shall such purchase be consummated after the termination of this Option pursuant to Section 2. The Notice shall be revocable by Acquisition Co. at any time prior to the exercise of the Option.
     3. Payment and Delivery of Certificate(s). At the Option Closing hereunder, (a) Acquisition Co. shall make payment to the Company of the aggregate price for the par value of the Optioned Shares so purchased in official bank check or by wire transfer to a bank designated in writing by the Company; (b) Acquisition Co. shall deliver to the Company a Promissory Note substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Note") for the aggregate price for the Optioned Shares so purchased minus the amount paid in accordance with clause 3(a); and (c) the Company shall deliver to Acquisition Co. a certificate or certificates representing the number of Optioned Shares so purchased registered in the name of Acquisition Co.. Certificates for Optioned Shares delivered at the Option Closing may be endorsed with a restrictive legend that shall read substantially as follows:
     "THE SECURITIES OFFERED HEREBY ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERABILITY AND RESALE AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED OR RESOLD EXCEPT AS PERMITTED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION OR EXEMPTION THEREFROM."
     It is understood and agreed that the reference to the resale restrictions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if Parent shall have delivered to the Company a copy of an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company to the effect that registration of the future resale of the Optioned Shares is not required and that such legend is not required for purposes of the Act.
     4. Representations and Warranties of the Company. The Company hereby represents and warrants (such representations and warranties being deemed repeated at and as of any Option Closing hereunder) to Parent and Acquisition Co. as follows:
 
          (a) Due Incorporation. The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Minnesota and has the requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and perform this Agreement.
          (b) Due Authorization, etc. This Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer of the Company and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by principles of equity regarding the availability of remedies.
          (c) Company's Capital Stock. The Company has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize and reserve for issuance upon exercise of the Option the Optioned Shares. The shares of Common Stock to be issued upon due exercise, in whole or in part, of the Option shall, when issued, be validly issued, fully-paid and non-assessable, and shall be delivered free and clear of all claims, liens, encumbrances and security interests, including any preemptive right of any of the shareholders of the Company. At the time of the Option Closing, the Optioned Shares will be deemed to be owned by Acquisition Co. for purposes of Section 302A.621 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act.
     5. Representations and Warranties of Parent and Acquisition Co. Parent and Acquisition Co. hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant (such representations and warranties being deemed repeated at and as of any Option Closing hereunder) to the Company as follows:
          (a) Due Incorporation. Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

          (c) Distribution. Acquisition Co. acknowledges and agrees that the Optioned Shares have not been registered, and that the Company is under no obligation to register, the Optioned Shares under the Act or any state securities laws. Acquisition Co. is acquiring the Option and will acquire the Optioned Shares to be purchased upon exercise of the Option for its own account and not with a view to the distribution thereof within the meaning of the Act. The
 
foregoing representation and warranty shall be made by any assignee under Section 7(a) and shall be binding upon such assignee.
     6. Adjustment Upon Changes in Capitalization. In the event of any change in the shares of the Company's capital stock by reason of any stock dividend, stock split, merger, recapitalization, combination, conversion, exchange of shares, issuance of shares (or agreements or commitments to issue shares) or the like, the number of Optioned Shares subject to the Option and the purchase price per Optioned Share shall be appropriately and equitably adjusted.
     7. Miscellaneous.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On January 24, 2005, Black Box Corporation of Pennsylvania ("BBCPA") and SF Acquisition Co. ("Purchaser" and together with BBCPA, the "Borrowers"), each subsidiaries of Black Box Corporation ("Parent"), Parent and certain subsidiaries owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent (collectively, with Parent, the "Guarantors" and, together with the Borrowers, the "Loan Parties") entered into a revolving senior credit facility (the "Acquisition Facility") in the form of a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania, as administrative agent ("Agent"), and certain other lender parties (together with the Agent, the "Lenders").
     Borrowings under the Acquisition Facility are permitted up to a maximum amount of $240,000,000, including up to $15,000,000 of swingline loans and $25,000,000 of letters of credit. The Acquisition Facility may be increased by Borrowers up to an additional $60,000,000 with the approval of the Lenders and may be unilaterally and permanently reduced by Borrowers to not less than the then outstanding amount of all borrowings (including letters of credit and swingline loans) under the Acquisition Facility upon not less than 10 days written notice.
     Borrowings under the Acquisition Facility were and will be used to consummate the Offer and Merger (each defined in Item 2.01 below), to refinance the existing credit facility of BBCPA, to repay all amounts due under Norstan's (defined in Item 2.01 below) current credit facility, to allow Parent to consummate additional acquisitions, to provide Parent funds for the repurchase of its common stock and for other general corporate purposes.
     The Acquisition Facility is unsecured, but is guaranteed by Parent and all of Parent's directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries that are incorporated (or organized) under the laws of the District of Columbia or under the laws of any state or commonwealth of the United States.
     Interest on outstanding indebtedness under the Acquisition Facility currently accrues, at the Company's option, at a rate based on either: (a) the greater of (i) the prime rate per annum of Agent then in effect and (ii) 0.50% the rate per annum announced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as being the weighted average of the rates on overnight Federal funds transactions arranged by Federal funds brokers on the previous trading day or (b) a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR rate 0.75% to 1.50% (determined by a leverage ratio based on Parent's EBITDA).
plus
plus
     The Acquisition Facility matures on August 31, 2008 and requires compliance with conditions precedent that must be satisfied prior to any borrowing as well as ongoing compliance with certain affirmative and negative covenants applicable to the Loan Parties, including Norstan and its domestic subsidiaries after the Merger.
     Conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the Acquisition Facility and the initial borrowing were satisfied on January 24, 2005. Conditions precedent to any subsequent borrowings include the accuracy, in all material respects, of the representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties as well as the absence of any potential default or event of default.
 
     The Acquisition Facility contains certain affirmative covenants, including covenants regarding the delivery of financial information, use of proceeds and continuation of similar line of business. It also contains certain negative covenants, including those restricting (with exceptions) liens, indebtedness, investments, dividends (while in default), sale-leasebacks, mergers or acquisitions or capital expenditures (while in default).
     The Acquisition Facility specifically permitted the Parent and Purchaser to complete the Offer and consummate the Merger, notwithstanding the foregoing covenants. The Acquisition Facility obligates the Loan Parties to satisfy financial covenants regarding Parent's consolidated net worth, leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio.
     The Acquisition Facility also contains customary events of default, including breaches of representations and warranties, the failure to comply with material covenants, a default on other indebtedness in excess of $2,000,000, a change of control of Parent or the failure of Parent to own, directly or indirectly, 100% of the outstanding stock of Borrowers.
     In connection with the Acquisition Facility, no Loan Party, is permitted, without the consent of the Lenders holding a majority of the commitments under the Acquisition Facility, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, to purchase or repurchase Parent capital stock from January 24, 2005 through and including July 24, 2005.
     As a result of the Merger, Norstan assumed the obligations of Purchaser under the Acquisition Facility and became a Borrower.
     The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Credit Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto.
Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
     On January 25, 2005, as a result of a tender offer (the "Offer") pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") dated as of December 20, 2004 by and among Parent, Purchaser and Norstan, Inc., a Minnesota corporation ("Norstan" or the "Company"), Purchaser acquired approximately 86 percent of the outstanding common stock, par value $0.10 per share, and any associated common stock purchase rights (collectively, the "Shares"), of the Company, giving Parent control of the Company. The consideration for each Share was $5.60 in cash.
     Additionally, on January 25, 2005 (the "Effective Time"), pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Purchaser was merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, all Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares held by a holder who has properly perfected statutory dissenters' rights or by the Company, Purchaser or Parent, or any of their respective subsidiaries), were converted into the right to receive $5.60 per Share in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). As a result of the
 
consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Purchaser has terminated, and the Company has become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
     The purchase price for the Shares was determined in arm's-length negotiations between Parent and the Company.
     Funds for payment of the Shares purchased in the Offer and the Merger were obtained pursuant to the Acquisition Facility described in Item 1.01 of this Form 8-K, which description is incorporated herein by reference.
     The information set forth above under Item 1.01 is incorporated herein by reference.
     (a) Financial Statements of Business Acquired. In accordance with Item 9.01(a) of Form 8-K, the financial statements for Norstan, Inc. required pursuant to Regulation S-X will be filed by amendment to this Form 8-K on or before April 12, 2005.
     (b) Pro Forma Financial Information. In accordance with Item 9.01(b) of Form 8-K, the pro forma financial information required pursuant to Regulation S-X will be filed by amendment to this Form 8-K on or before April 12, 2005.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, February 1, 2005  Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported for the third quarter ended January 1, 2005 diluted earnings per share of 52 compared to 66 last year. Net income for the third quarter was $9.2 million or 7.3% of revenues, compared to $12.2 million or 9.2% of revenues last year. On a sequential comparison basis, second quarter diluted earnings per share were 60 with corresponding net income of $10.6 million or 8.4% of revenues.
Total revenues for the third quarter were $127 million, down 5% from $133 million for the same period last year, and comparable to sequential second quarter revenues of $127 million.
Third quarter cash provided by operating activities was approximately $14 million or 148% of net income, compared to $16 million or 128% of net income for the same period last year. On a sequential comparison basis, second quarter cash provided by operating activities was $11 million. Black Box utilized its third quarter cash provided by operating activities of $14 million to make a dividend payment of $1 million, reduce debt by $12 million and increase cash on hand by $1 million.
 
Page 2
For the nine months ended January 1, 2005, diluted earnings per share were $1.66 compared to $1.90 for the same period last year, down 13%. Corresponding net income for the nine-month period was $30 million or 7.9% of revenues, compared to $36 million or 9.1% of revenues for the same period last year.
Total nine-month revenues were $378 million, down 3% from $391 million for the same period last year.
Cash provided by operating activities for the nine-month period was $34 million or 115% of net income, compared to $47 million or 130% of net income last year. Black Box utilized the nine-month cash provided by operating activities of $34 million, together with $7 million from other sources of cash, to make dividend payments of $3 million and repurchase $38 million of its Common Stock.
The Company's 6-month order backlog was $54 million at January 1, 2005 compared to $55 million at the end of the second quarter.
Commenting on the third quarter results, Fred C. Young, Chief Executive Officer, said, "Tactically, total revenues of $127 million were comparable with our last sequential quarter. We would have liked to have delivered $2 to $3 million more top-line, particularly in our Hotline Services, to better match the current cost structure. This is affecting our short-term profits as we are striving to achieve a revenue lift in this specific area and support the recent Norstan merger over the next couple of quarters. In addition, our worldwide Sarbanes-Oxley 404 implementation costs in the quarter were $1.3 million or about 6 cents per share. The bulk of these costs should subside by the end of June 2005. Operating cash flow remained strong at approximately $14 million.
Strategically, we are very excited about the Norstan merger completed on January 25, 2005. This merger will increase our immediate revenues by almost 40%. Our goal over the next couple of years is to leverage this revenue such that we achieve a corresponding increase in profits and cash flow. Scott G. Christian, previously the CEO of Norstan, and his team will lead Black Box's

newest Voice Services Group based out of Minnetonka, MN (a suburb of Minneapolis). We are currently focused on integrating the two companies as quickly as possible. As part of this effort, we will incur some one-time charges in our fiscal fourth quarter ending March 31, 2005.
Through the success of this integration, our expectations remain high for significant incremental marketing, operational and financial benefits. Beginning with our new fiscal year as of April 1, 2005, we expect quarterly combined revenues to be in a range of $174 to $177 million, gross profit to be in the range of 39% to 40% of revenues and operating expenses to be in the range of 28% to 29% of revenues. Over time, we will look to increase our overall gross margins by 1% to 2% while reducing operating expenses by 1% to 2%.
In summary, our goals are straightforward: successfully execute the Norstan integration plan, drive organic growth by aggressively cross-selling all three of the Black Box Technical Services and selectively look for additional M&A opportunities that complement our overall long-term growth strategy."
The Company also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of 6 per share of common stock. The dividend was declared on all outstanding shares of Black Box's common stock and will be payable on April 15, 2005 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 31, 2005. Black Box will pay the dividend through its transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company.
The Company will conduct a conference call beginning at 5:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time today, February 1, 2005. Fred C. Young, Chief Executive Officer, will host the call. To participate in the call, please dial 612-332-0802 approximately 15 minutes prior to the starting time and ask to be connected to the Black Box Earnings Call.

Company
Employee Plan

Directors' Plan
     The foregoing amendments are reflected in the copies of the Employee Plan and Directors' Plan filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
     (c) Exhibits. The following exhibits are being filed in accordance with Item 601 of Regulation S-K:
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
Exhibit 10.1
     
I. PURPOSES
     BLACK BOX CORPORATION (the "Company") desires to afford certain of its key employees and the key employees of any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company now existing or hereafter formed or acquired who are responsible for the continued growth of the Company an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company, and thus to create in such key employees an increased interest in and a greater concern for the welfare of the Company and its subsidiaries.
     The Company, by means of this 1992 Stock Option Plan as originally approved on November 11, 1992, and as further amended on May 10, 1994, August 9, 1994, August 7, 1995, August 12, 1996, August 13, 1997, February 3, 1998, August 10, 1998, August 10, 1999, August 8, 2000, August 23, 2001, August 15, 2002, August 12, 2003, August 10, 2004 and March 15, 2005 (the "Plan"), seeks to retain the services of persons now holding key positions and to secure the services of persons capable of filling such positions.
     The stock options ("Options") and stock appreciation rights ("Rights") offered pursuant to the Plan are a matter of separate inducement and are not in lieu of any salary or other compensation for the services of any key employee.
     The Options granted under the Plan are intended to be either incentive stock options ("Incentive Options") within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or options that do not meet the requirements for Incentive Options ("Non-Qualified Options"), but the Company makes no warranty as to the qualification of any Option as an Incentive Option.
     
II. AMOUNT OF STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN; PER PERSON LIMITATION
     The total number of shares of common stock of the Company which may be purchased or acquired pursuant to the exercise of Options or Rights granted under the Plan shall not exceed, in the aggregate, 8,300,000 shares of the authorized common stock, $.001 par value per share, of the Company (the "Shares"), such number subject to adjustment as provided in Article XII hereof. Shares that are the subject of Rights and related Options shall be counted only once in determining whether the maximum number of Shares that may be purchased or awarded under the Plan has been exceeded. No person may receive Options or Rights under the Plan for more than 500,000 Shares in any given fiscal year.
     Shares acquired under the Plan may be either authorized but unissued Shares or Shares of issued stock held in the Company's treasury, or both, at the discretion of the Company. If and to the extent that Options or Rights granted under the Plan expire or terminate without having been exercised, the Shares covered by such expired or terminated Options or Rights shall again become available for award under the Plan.
 
     Except as provided in Article XIX and subject to Article II, the Company may, from time to time during the period beginning on the date on which the Company consummates an underwritten initial public offering of Shares (the "Effective Date") and originally ending on November 30, 2002 but amended to end on November 30, 2012 (the "Termination Date"), grant to certain key employees of the Company, or of any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company now existing or hereafter formed or acquired, Incentive Options and/or Non-Qualified Options and/or Rights under the terms hereinafter set forth.
     Provisions of the Plan that pertain to Options or Rights granted to an employee shall apply to Options, Rights or a combination thereof.
     As used in the Plan, the term "subsidiary corporation" and "parent corporation" shall mean, respectively, a corporation coming within the definition of such terms contained in Sections 424(f) and 424(e) of the Code.
     
III. ADMINISTRATION
     The board of directors of the Company (the "Board of Directors") shall designate from among its members an option committee, which may be the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee"), to administer the Plan. The Committee shall consist of no fewer than two members of the Board of Directors, each of whom shall be a "disinterested person" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 (or any successor rule or regulation) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). A majority of the members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum, and the act of a majority of the members of the Committee shall be the act of the Committee. Any member of the Committee may be removed at any time either with or without cause by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors, and any vacancy on the Committee at any time may be filled by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors.
     Subject to the express provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have authority, in its discretion, to determine the employees to whom Options or Rights shall be granted, the time when such Options or Rights shall be granted, the number of Shares which shall be subject to each Option or Right, the purchase price or exercise price of each Option or Right, the period(s) during which such Options or Rights shall become exercisable (whether in whole or in part) and the other terms and provisions thereof (which need not be identical).
     Subject to the express provisions of the Plan, the Committee also shall have authority to construe the Plan and the Options and Rights granted thereunder, to amend the Plan and the Options and Rights granted thereunder, to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, to determine the terms and provisions of the Options (which need not be identical) and Rights (which need not be identical) granted thereunder and to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for administering the Plan. The Committee also shall have the authority to require, in its discretion, as a condition of the granting of any such Option or Right, that the employee agree (i) not to sell or otherwise dispose of Shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of such Option or Right for a period of six (6) months following the date of the acquisition of such Option or Right and (ii) that in the event of termination of employment of such employee, other than as a result of dismissal without cause, such employee will not, for a
 
period to be fixed at the time of the grant of the Option or Right, enter into any other employment or participate directly or indirectly in any other business or enterprise which is competitive with the business of the Company or any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company, or enter into any employment in which such employee will be called upon to utilize special knowledge obtained through employment with the Company or any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation thereof. In no event will an employee who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act be entitled to sell or otherwise dispose of any Shares acquired pursuant to exercise of any such Options or Rights for a period of six (6) months from the date of the acquisition of such Options or Rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall not have the authority to reprice any outstanding Option or Right without stockholder approval.
     The determination of the Committee on matters referred to in this Article III shall be conclusive.
     The Committee may employ such legal counsel, consultants and agents as it may deem desirable for the administration of the Plan and may rely upon any opinion or computation received from any such legal counsel, consultant or agent. Expenses incurred by the Committee in the engagement of such counsel, consultant or agent shall be paid by the Company. No member or former member of the Committee shall be liable for any action or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any award of Options or Rights granted hereunder.
     
IV. ELIGIBILITY
     Options and Rights may be granted only to key employees of the Company or of any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company, except as hereinafter provided, and shall not be granted to any officer or director who is not also a key employee or to any member of the Committee. Any person who shall have retired from active employment by the Company or a subsidiary corporation or parent corporation thereof, although such person shall have entered into a consulting contract with the Company or a subsidiary corporation or parent corporation thereof, shall not be eligible to receive an Option or a Right.
     The Plan does not create a right in any employee to participate in the Plan, nor does it create a right in any employee to have any Options or Rights granted to him or her.
     
V. OPTION PRICE AND PAYMENT
     The price for each Share purchasable under any Option granted hereunder shall be such amount as the Committee shall, in its best judgment, determine to be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value per Share at the date the Option is granted; , , that in the case of an Incentive Option granted to a person who, at the time such Option is granted, owns shares of the Company or any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company which possesses more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of shares of the Company or of any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company, the purchase price for each Share shall be such amount as the Committee in its best judgment shall determine to be not less than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the fair market value per Share at the date the Option is granted. In determining stock ownership of an employee for any purposes under the Plan, the rules of Section 424(d) of the Code shall be
provided
however
 
applied, and the Committee may rely on representations of fact made to it by the employee and believed by it to be true.
     If the Shares are listed on a national securities exchange in the United States (which, for purposes of this Article V, shall be deemed to include any last sale reported over-the-counter market), on any date on which the fair market value per Share is to be determined, the fair market value per Share shall be deemed to be the average of the high and low quotations at which such Shares are sold on such national securities exchange on the date such Option is granted. If the Shares are listed on a national securities exchange in the United States on such date, but the Shares are not traded on such date, or such national securities exchange is not open for business on such date, the fair market value per Share shall be determined as of the closest preceding date on which such exchange shall have been open for business and the Shares shall have been traded. If the Shares are listed on more than one national securities exchange in the United States on the date on which the fair market value per Share is to be determined, the Committee shall determine which national securities exchange shall be used for the purpose of determining the fair market value per Share.
     If a public market exists for the Shares on any date on which the fair market value per Share is to be determined but the Shares are not listed on a national securities exchange in the United States, the fair market value per Share shall be deemed to be the mean between the closing bid and asked quotations in the over-the-counter market for the Shares on such date. If there are no bid and asked quotations for the Shares on such date, the fair market value per Share shall be deemed to be the mean between the closing bid and asked quotations in the over-the-counter market for the Shares on the closest date preceding such date for which such quotations are available.
     If no public market exists for the Shares on any date on which the fair market value per Share is to be determined, the Committee shall, in its sole discretion and best judgment, determine the fair market value of a Share.
     For purposes of this Plan, the determination by the Committee of the fair market value of a Share shall be conclusive.
     Upon the exercise of an Option granted hereunder, the Company shall cause the purchased Shares to be issued only when it shall have received the full purchase price for the Shares in cash or by certified check; , , that in lieu of cash, the holder of an Option may, if and to the extent the terms of such Option so provide and to the extent permitted by applicable law, exercise an Option (i) in whole or in part, by delivering to the Company shares of common stock of the Company (in proper form for transfer and accompanied by all requisite stock transfer tax stamps or cash in lieu thereof) owned by such holder having a fair market value equal to the exercise price applicable to that portion of the Option being exercised by the delivery of such Shares or (ii) in part, by delivering to the Company an executed promissory note on such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine, at the time of grant, in its sole discretion; , , that the principal amount of such note shall not exceed eighty percent (80%) (or such lesser percentage as would be permitted by applicable margin regulations) of the aggregate purchase price of the Shares then being purchased pursuant to the exercise of such Option. The fair market value of the stock so delivered shall be
provided
however
provided
however
 
determined as of the date immediately preceding the date on which the Option is exercised, or as may be required in order to comply with or to conform to the requirements of any applicable laws or regulations.
     
VI. USE OF PROCEEDS
     The cash proceeds of the sale of Shares pursuant to the Plan are to be added to the general funds of the Company and used for its general corporate purposes as the Board of Directors shall determine.
     
VII. TERM OF OPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE RIGHT OF EXERCISE
     Any Option shall be exercisable at such times, in such amounts and during such period or periods as the Committee shall determine at the date of the grant of such Option; , , that an Incentive Option shall not be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date such Option is granted; and that, in the case of an Incentive Option granted to a person who, at the time such Option is granted, owns stock of the Company or any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company possessing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or of any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company, such Option shall not be exercisable after the expiration of five (5) years from the date such Option is granted.
provided
however
provided
further
     Except to the extent otherwise provided under the Code, to the extent that the aggregate fair market value of stock for which Incentive Options are exercisable for the first time by an employee during any calendar year (under all stock option plans of the Company and of any parent corporation or subsidiary corporation of the Company) exceeds one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), such Options shall be treated as Non-Qualified Options. For purposes of this limitation, (i) the fair market value of stock is determined as of the time the Option is granted, and (ii) the limitation will be applied by taking into account Options in the order in which they were granted.
     Subject to the provisions of Article XVIII, the Committee shall have the right to accelerate, in whole or in part, from time to time, conditionally or unconditionally, rights to exercise any Option granted hereunder.
     To the extent that an Option is not exercised within the period of exercisability specified therein, it shall expire as to the then unexercised part.
     In no event shall an Option granted hereunder be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
     
VIII. EXERCISE OF OPTIONS
     Options granted under the Plan shall be exercised by the optionee as to all or part of the Shares covered thereby by the giving of written notice of the exercise thereof to the Corporate Secretary of the Company at the principal business office of the Company, specifying the number of Shares to be purchased and specifying a business day not more than fifteen (15) days from the date such notice is given for the payment of the purchase price against delivery of the Shares being purchased. Subject to the terms of Articles XIV, XVI, and XVII, the Company
 
shall cause certificates for the Shares so purchased to be delivered to the optionee at the principal business office of the Company, against payment of the full purchase price, on the date specified in the notice of exercise.
     
IX. STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
     In the discretion of the Committee, a Right may be granted (i) alone, (ii) simultaneously with the grant of an Option (either Incentive or Non-Qualified) and in conjunction therewith or in the alternative thereto or (iii) subsequent to the grant of a Non-Qualified Option and in conjunction therewith or in the alternative thereto.
     The exercise price of a Right granted alone shall be determined by the Committee but shall not be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value of one Share on the date of grant of such Right. A Right granted simultaneously with or subsequent to the grant of an Option and in conjunction therewith or in the alternative thereto shall have the same exercise price as the related Option, shall be transferable only upon the same terms and conditions as the related Option, and shall be exercisable only to the same extent as the related Option; , , that a Right, by its terms, shall be exercisable only when the fair market value of the Shares subject to the Right and related Option exceeds the exercise price thereof.
provided
however
     Upon exercise of a Right granted simultaneously with or subsequent to an Option and in the alternative thereto, the number of Shares for which the related Option shall be exercisable shall be reduced by the number of Shares for which the Right shall have been exercised. The number of Shares for which a Right shall be exercisable shall be reduced upon any exercise of a related Option by the number of Shares for which such Option shall have been exercised.
     Any Right shall be exercisable upon such additional terms and conditions as may from time to time be prescribed by the Committee.
     A Right shall entitle the holder upon exercise thereof to receive from the Company, upon a written request filed with the Corporate Secretary of the Company at its principal offices (the "Request"), a number of Shares (with or without restrictions as to substantial risk of forfeiture and transferability, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion), an amount of cash, or any combination of Shares and cash, as specified in the Request (but subject to the approval of the Committee in its sole discretion, at any time up to and including the time of payment, as to the making of any cash payment), having an aggregate fair market value equal to the product of (i) the excess of the fair market value, on the day of such Request, of one Share over the exercise price per share specified in such Right or its related Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of Shares for which such Right shall be exercised.
     Any election by a holder of a Right to receive cash in full or partial settlement of such Right, and any exercise of such Right for cash, may be made only by a Request filed with the Corporate Secretary of the Company during the period beginning on the third business day following the date of release for publication by the Company of quarterly or annual summary statements of sales and earnings and ending on the twelfth business day following such date. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt by the Company of a Request to receive cash in full or partial settlement of a Right or to exercise such Right for cash, the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, either consent to or disapprove, in whole or in part, such Request. A Request to
 
receive cash in full or partial settlement of a Right or to exercise a Right for cash may provide that, in the event the Committee shall disapprove such Request, such Request shall be deemed to be an exercise of such Right for Shares.
     If the Committee disapproves in whole or in part any election by a holder to receive cash in full or partial settlement of a Right or to exercise such Right for cash, such disapproval shall not affect such holder's right to exercise such Right at a later date, to the extent that such Right shall be otherwise exercisable, or to elect the form of payment at a later date, provided that an election to receive cash upon such later exercise shall be subject to the approval of the Committee. Additionally, such disapproval shall not affect such holder's right to exercise any related Option or Options granted to such holder under the Plan.
     A holder of a Right shall not be entitled to request or receive cash in full or partial payment of such Right unless such Right shall have been held for six (6) months from the date of acquisition to the date of cash settlement thereof; , , that such prohibition shall not apply if the holder of such Right is not subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. In no event will a holder of a Right who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act be entitled to make such a request or receive cash in full or partial payment of such Right until the Company shall have satisfied the informational requirements of Rule 16b-3(e)(1) promulgated under the Exchange Act for the specified one year period.
provided
however
     A Right shall be deemed exercised on the last day of its term, if not otherwise exercised by the holder thereof, provided that the fair market value of the Shares subject to the Right exceeds the exercise price thereof on such date.
     For all purposes of this Article IX, the fair market value of Shares shall be determined in accordance with the principles set forth in the Article V.
     
X. NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
     Neither an Option nor a Right granted hereunder shall be transferable, whether by operation of law or otherwise, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and any Option or Right granted hereunder shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the holder only by such holder. Except to the extent provided above, Options and Rights may not be assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or disposed of in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) and shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process.
     
XI. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT
     Upon termination of employment of any employee with the Company and all subsidiary corporations and parent corporations of the Company, an Option or Right previously granted to the employee, unless otherwise specified by the Committee in the Option or Right, shall, to the extent not theretofore exercised, terminate and become null and void, provided that:
          (a) if the employee shall die while in the employ of such corporation or during either the three (3) month or one (1) year period, whichever is applicable, specified in
 
clause (b) below and at a time when such employee was entitled to exercise an Option or Right as herein provided, the legal representative of such employee, or such person who acquired such Option or Right by bequest or inheritance or by reason of the death of the employee, may, not later than one (1) year from the date of death, exercise such Option or Right, to the extent not theretofore exercised, in respect of any or all of such number of Shares as specified by the Committee in such Option or Right; and
          (b) if the employment of an employee to whom such Option or Right shall have been granted shall terminate by reason of the employee's retirement (at such age or upon such conditions as shall be specified by the Board of Directors), disability (as described in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code) or dismissal by the employer other than for cause (as defined below), and while such employee is entitled to exercise such Option or Right as herein provided, such employee shall have the right to exercise such Option or Right so granted, to the extent not theretofore exercised, in respect of any or all of such number of Shares as specified by the Committee in such Option or Right, at any time up to and including (i) three (3) months after the date of such termination of employment in the case of termination by reason of retirement or dismissal other than for cause and (ii) one (1) year after the date of termination of employment in the case of termination by reason of disability.
       If an employee voluntarily terminates his or her employment, or is discharged for cause, any Option or Right granted hereunder shall, unless otherwise specified by the Committee in the Option or Right, forthwith terminate with respect to any unexercised portion thereof.
       If an Option or Right granted hereunder shall be exercised by the legal representative of a deceased or disabled employee or former employee, or by a person who acquired an Option or Right granted hereunder by bequest or inheritance or by reason of death of any employee or former employee, written notice of such exercise shall be accompanied by a certified copy of letters testamentary or equivalent proof of the right of such legal representative or other person to exercise such Option or Right.
       For the purposes of the Plan, the term "for cause" shall mean (i) with respect to an employee who is party to a written agreement with, or, alternatively, participates in a compensation or benefit plan of the Company or a subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company, which agreement or plan contains a definition of "for cause" or "cause" (or words of like import) for purposes of termination of employment thereunder by the Company or such subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company, "for cause" or "cause" as defined in the most recent of such agreements or plans, or (ii) in all other cases, (a) the willful commission by an employee of a criminal or other act that causes substantial economic damage to the Company or a subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company or substantial injury to the business reputation of the Company or a subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company; (b) the commission by an employee of an act of fraud in the performance of such employee's duties on behalf of the Company or a subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company; or (c) the continuing willful failure of an employee to perform the duties of such employee to the Company or a subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company (other than such failure resulting from the employee's incapacity due to physical or mental illness) after written notice thereof (specifying the particulars thereof in
 
reasonable detail) and a reasonable opportunity to be heard and cure such failure are given to the employee by the Board of Directors or the Committee. For purposes of the Plan, no act, or failure to act, on the employee's part shall be considered "willful" unless done or omitted to be done by the employee not in good faith and without reasonable belief that the employee's action or omission was in the best interest of the Company or a subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company.
     For the purposes of the Plan, an employment relationship shall be deemed to exist between an individual and a corporation if, at the time of the determination, the individual was an "employee" of such corporation for purposes of Section 422(a) of the Code. If an individual is on military, sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence, such individual shall be considered an "employee" for purposes of the exercise of an Option or Right and shall be entitled to exercise such Option or Right during such leave if the period of such leave does not exceed ninety (90) days, or, if longer, so long as the individual's right to reemployment with the corporation granting the option (or a related corporation) is guaranteed either by statute or by contract. If the period of leave exceeds ninety (90) days, the employment relationship shall be deemed to have terminated on the ninety-first (91st) day of such leave, unless the individual's right to reemployment is guaranteed by statute or contract.
     A termination of employment shall not be deemed to occur by reason of (i) the transfer of an employee from employment by the Company to employment by a subsidiary corporation or a parent corporation of the Company or (ii) the transfer of an employee from employment by a subsidiary corporation or a parent corporation of the Company to employment by the Company or by another subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company. Furthermore, solely for purposes of determining the rights and obligations under any outstanding Options or Rights theretofore granted, in the event that the Company ceases to own, directly or indirectly, stock possessing fifty percent (50%) or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of a subsidiary company by virtue of a recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, split-up, spin-off, combination of shares or other like change in capital structure of the Company, the Committee may determine that employment by such former subsidiary (or any parent or subsidiary company of such subsidiary) shall continue to be deemed to be employment by the Company for purposes of the Plan.
     In the event of the complete liquidation or dissolution of a subsidiary corporation, or in the event that the Company ceases to own, directly or indirectly, stock possessing fifty percent (50%) or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of such corporation, any unexercised Options or Rights theretofore granted to any person employed by such subsidiary corporation will be deemed canceled unless such person is employed by the Company or by any parent corporation or another subsidiary corporation after the occurrence of such event. In the event an Option or Right is to be canceled pursuant to the provisions of the previous sentence, notice of such cancellation will be given to each employee holding unexercised Options or Rights and such holder will have the right to exercise such Options or Rights in full (without regard to any limitation set forth or imposed pursuant to Article VII) during the thirty (30) day period following notice of such cancellation.
 
     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article XI, in no event, however, shall any person be entitled to exercise any Option or Right after the expiration of the period of exercisability of such Option or Right as specified therein.
     
XII. ADJUSTMENT OF SHARES; EFFECT OF CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS
     In the event of any change in the outstanding Shares through merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, split-up, split-off, spin-off, combination of shares, exchange of shares, issuance of rights to subscribe for Shares, or other like change in capital structure of the Company, the Committee shall make such adjustment to each outstanding Option and Right that it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate. The term "Shares" after any such change shall refer to the securities, cash and/or property then receivable upon exercise of an Option or Right. In addition, in the event of any such change, the Committee shall make any further adjustments as may be appropriate to the maximum number of Shares which may be acquired under the Plan pursuant to the exercise of Options and Rights, the maximum number of Shares which may be so acquired by one employee and the number of Shares and prices per Share subject to outstanding Options and Rights as shall be equitable to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights under such Options or Rights, and the determination of the Committee as to these matters shall be conclusive. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) each such adjustment with respect to an Incentive Option and any related Right shall comply with the rules of Section 424(a) of the Code and (ii) in no event shall any adjustment be made which would render any Incentive Option granted hereunder to be other than an "incentive stock option" for purposes of Section 422 of the Code.
     In the event of a "change in control" of the Company, all then outstanding Options and Rights shall immediately become exercisable. For purposes of the Plan, a "change in control" of the Company occurs if: (a) any "Person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act), other than Odyssey Partners, L.P. and its affiliates (which, for purposes of this Article XII only, is deemed to include E.R. Yost) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly of securities of the Company representing (i) fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then-outstanding securities; or (ii) twenty-five percent (25%) or more but less than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the Company's then-outstanding securities if such transaction(s) giving rise to such beneficial ownership are not approved by the Company's Board of Directors; or (b) at any time a majority of the members of the Board of Directors has been elected or designated by any Person, other than Odyssey Partners, L.P. and its affiliates (which, for purposes of this Article XII only, is deemed to include E.R. Yost); or (c) the Board of Directors shall approve a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or any merger, consolidation, issuance of securities or purchase of assets, in all cases other than to or with Odyssey Partners, L.P. or its affiliates (which, for purposes of this Article XII only, is deemed to include E.R. Yost), the result of which would be the occurrence of any event described in clause (a) or (b) above.
     The Committee, in its discretion, may determine that, upon the occurrence of a transaction described in the preceding paragraph, each Option or Right outstanding hereunder shall terminate within a specified number of days after notice to the holder, and such holder shall receive, with respect to each Share subject to such Option or Right, cash in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such Shares immediately prior to the occurrence of such
 
transaction over the exercise price per share of such Option or Right. The provisions contained in the preceding sentence shall be inapplicable to an Option or Right granted within six (6) months before the occurrence of a transaction described above if the holder of such Option or Right is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.
     
XIII. RIGHT TO TERMINATE EMPLOYMENT
     The Plan shall not impose any obligation on the Company or on any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation thereof to continue the employment of any holder of Options or Rights and it shall not impose any obligation on the part of any holder of Options or Rights to remain in the employ of the Company or of any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation thereof.
     
XIV. PURCHASE FOR INVESTMENT
     Except for hereinafter provided, the Committee may require an employee, as a condition upon exercise of any Option or Right granted hereunder, to execute and deliver to the Company (a) stock powers with respect to Shares underlying a particular Option or Right and required to be held by a custodian, and (b) a written statement, in form satisfactory to the Committee in which the employee represents and warrants that Shares are being acquired for such person's own account for investment only and not with a view to the resale or distribution thereof. The employee shall, at the request of the Committee, be required to represent and warrant in writing that any subsequent resale or distribution of Shares by the Employee shall be made only pursuant to either (i) a Registration Statement on an appropriate form under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), which Registration Statement has become effective and is current with regard to the Shares being sold, or (ii) a specific exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, but in claiming such exemption the employee shall, prior to any offer of sale or sale of such Shares, obtain a prior favorable written opinion of counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to counsel for the Company, as to the application of such exemption thereto. The foregoing restriction shall not apply to (i) issuances by the Company so long as the Shares being issued are registered under the Securities Act and a prospectus in respect thereof is current or (ii) re-offerings of Shares by affiliates of the Company (as defined in Rule 405 or any successor rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act) if the Shares being re-offered are registered under the Securities Act and a prospectus in respect thereof is current.
     
XV. ISSUE OF CERTIFICATES, LEGENDS, PAYMENT OF EXPENSES
     Upon any exercise of an Option or Right which may be granted hereunder and, in the case of an Option, payment of the purchase price, a certificate or certificates for the Shares shall be issued by the Company in the name of the person exercising the Option or Right and shall be delivered to or upon the order of such person.
     The Company may endorse such legend or legends upon the certificates for Shares issued pursuant to the Plan and may issue such "stop transfer" instructions to its transfer agent in respect of such Shares as, in its discretion, it determines to be necessary or appropriate to (i) prevent a violation of, or to perfect an exemption from, the registration requirements of the Securities Act, (ii) implement the provisions of the Plan and any agreement between the Company and the
 
optionee or grantee with respect to such Shares, or (iii) permit the Company to determine the occurrence of a disqualifying disposition, as described in Section 421(b) of the Code, of Shares transferred upon exercise of an Incentive Option granted under the Plan.
     The Company shall pay all issue or transfer taxes with respect to the issuance of transfer of Shares, as well as all fees and expenses necessarily incurred by the Company in connection with such issuance or transfer, except fees and expenses which may be necessitated by the filing or amending of a Registration Statement under the Securities Act, which fees and expenses shall be borne by the recipient of the Shares unless such Registration Statement has been filed by the Company for its own corporate purposes (and the Company so states) in which event the recipient of the Shares shall bear only fees and expenses as are attributable solely to the inclusion of the Shares he or she received in the Registration Statement.
     All Shares issued as provided herein shall be fully paid and non-assessable to the extent permitted by law.
     
XVI. WITHHOLDING TAXES
     The Company may require an employee exercising a Right or Non-Qualified Option granted hereunder, or disposing of Shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Incentive Option in a disqualifying disposition (within the meaning of Section 421(b) of the Code), to reimburse the corporation that employs such employee for any taxes required by any government to be withheld or otherwise deducted and paid by such corporation in respect of the issuance or disposition of such Shares. In lieu thereof, the corporation that employs such employee shall have the right to withhold the amount of such taxes from any other sums due or to become due from such corporation to the employee upon such terms and conditions as the Committee shall prescribe. The corporation that employs such employee may, in its discretion, hold the stock certificate to which such employee is entitled upon the exercise of an Option as security for the payment of such withholding tax liability, until cash sufficient to pay that liability has been accumulated. In addition, at any time that the Company becomes subject to a withholding obligation under applicable law with respect to the exercise of a Right or Non-Qualified Option (the "Tax Date"), except as set forth below, a holder of a Right or Non-Qualified Option may elect to satisfy, in whole or in part, the holder's related personal tax liabilities (an "Election") by (i) directing the Company to withhold from Shares issuable in the related exercise either a specified number of Shares or Shares having a specified value (in each case not in excess of the related personal tax liabilities), (ii) tendering Shares previously issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option or Right or other Shares of the Company's common stock owned by the holder or (iii) combining any or all of the foregoing options in any fashion. An Election shall be irrevocable. The withheld Shares and other Shares tendered in payment shall be valued at their fair market value (determined in accordance with the principles set forth in Article V of the Plan) on the Tax Date. The Committee may disapprove of any Election, suspend or terminate the right to make Elections or provide that the right to make Elections shall not apply to particular Shares or exercises. The Committee may prescribe additional rules, in its discretion, to permit a holder of an Option or Right who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to effect such tax withholding in compliance with the Rules promulgated under Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the positions of the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission
 
expressed in no-action or interpretative letters exempting such tax withholding transactions from liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. The Committee may also impose any additional conditions or restrictions on the right to make an Election as it shall deem appropriate.
     
XVII. LISTING OF SHARES AND RELATED MATTERS
     The Committee may delay any award, issuance or delivery of Shares if it determines that listing, registration or qualification of Shares or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the sale or purchase of Shares under the Plan, until such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained, or otherwise provided for, free of any conditions not acceptable to the Committee.
     
XVIII. AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN
     The Board of Directors or the Committee, as the case may be, may, from time to time, amend the Plan, provided that no amendment shall be made, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company, that will (i) increase the total number of Shares reserved for Options under the Plan (other than an increase resulting from an adjustment provided for in Article XII), (ii) reduce the exercise price of any Incentive Option granted hereunder below the price required by Article V, (iii) modify the provisions of the Plan relating to eligibility, or (iv) materially increase the benefits accruing to participants under the Plan. The Board of Directors or the Committee, as the case may be, shall be authorized to amend the Plan and the Options granted thereunder to permit the Incentive Options granted thereunder to qualify as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code. The rights and obligations under any Option or Right granted before amendment of the Plan or any unexercised portion of such Option or Right shall not be adversely affected by amendment of the Plan, Option or Right without the consent of the holder of such Option or Right.

Options and Rights may not be granted while the Plan is suspended or after it is terminated. Rights and obligations under any Option or Right granted while the Plan is in effect shall not be altered or impaired by suspension or termination of the Plan, except upon the consent of the person to whom the Option or Right was granted. The power of the Committee to construe and administer any Options or Rights granted prior to the termination or suspension of the Plan under Article III nevertheless shall continue after such termination or during such suspension.

Exhibit 10.2
     
I. PURPOSES
     BLACK BOX CORPORATION (the "Company") desires to afford certain of its directors, and certain directors of any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company now existing or hereafter formed or acquired an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company, and thus to create in such directors an increased interest in and a greater concern for the welfare of the Company and its subsidiaries.
     The Company, by means of this 1992 Director Stock Option Plan, as originally approved on November 11, 1992, and as further amended on, May 10, 1994, August 9, 1994, August 7, 1995, August 12, 1996, August 13, 1997, September 2, 1997, February 3, 1998, May 5, 1998, August 10, 1998, August 10, 1999, August 23, 2001, August 15, 2002, August 12, 2003, August 10, 2004 and March 15, 2005 (the "Plan"), seeks to retain the services of certain persons now serving as directors and to secure the services of persons capable of filling such positions.
     The stock options ("Options") and stock appreciation rights ("Rights") offered pursuant to the Plan are a matter of separate inducement and are not in lieu of any salary or other compensation for the services of any director.
     The Options granted under the Plan are intended to be options that do not meet the requirements for incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
     
II. AMOUNT OF STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN
     The total number of shares of common stock of the Company which may be purchased or acquired pursuant to the exercise of Options or Rights granted under the Plan shall not exceed, in the aggregate, 250,000 shares of the authorized common stock, $.001 par value per share, of the Company (the "Shares"), such number subject to adjustment as provided in Article XII hereof. Shares that are the subject of Rights and related Options shall be counted only once in determining whether the maximum number of Shares that may be purchased or awarded under the Plan has been exceeded.
     Shares acquired under the Plan may be either authorized but unissued Shares or Shares of issued stock held in the Company's treasury, or both, at the discretion of the Company. If and to the extent that Options or Rights granted under the Plan expire or terminate without having been exercised, the Shares covered by such expired or terminated Options or Rights shall again become available for award under the Plan.
     Except as provided in Article XVIII and subject to Article II, the Company may, from time to time during the period beginning on the date on which the Company consummates an underwritten initial public offering of Shares (the "Effective Date") and originally ending on November 30, 2002 but amended to end on November 2012 (the "Termination Date"), grant to
 
certain directors of the Company, or of any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company now existing or hereafter formed or acquired, Options and/or Rights under the terms hereinafter set forth.
     Provisions of the Plan that pertain to Options or Rights granted to a director shall apply to Options, Rights or a combination thereof.
     As used in the Plan, the term "subsidiary corporation" and "parent corporation" shall mean, respectively, a corporation coming within the definition of such terms contained in Sections 424(f) and 424(e) of the Code.
     
III. ADMINISTRATION
     The board of directors of the Company (the "Board") may designate from among its members a director stock option committee (the "Committee") to administer the Plan. The Committee shall consist of no fewer than two members of the Board, each of whom shall be a "Non-Employee Director" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 (or any successor rule or regulation) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). A majority of the members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum, and the act of a majority of the members of the Committee shall be the act of the Committee. Any member of the Committee may be removed at any time either with or without cause by resolution adopted by the Board, and any vacancy on the Committee at any time may be filled by resolution adopted by the Board.
     Subject to the express provisions of the Plan, the Board and the Committee shall have authority, in their discretion, to determine the directors to whom Options or Rights shall be granted, the time when such Options or Rights shall be granted, the number of Shares which shall be subject to each Option or Right, the purchase price or exercise price of each Option or Right, the period(s) during which such Options or Rights shall become exercisable (whether in whole or in part) and the other terms and provisions thereof (which need not be identical).
     Subject to the express provisions of the Plan, the Board and the Committee also shall have authority to construe the Plan and the Options and Rights granted thereunder, to amend the Plan and the Options and Rights granted thereunder, to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, to determine the terms and provisions of the Options (which need not be identical) and Rights (which need not be identical) granted thereunder and to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for administering the Plan. The Board and the Committee also shall have the authority to require, in its discretion, as a condition of the granting of any such Option or Right, that the director agree (i) not to sell or otherwise dispose of Shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of such Option or Right for a period of six (6) months following the date of the acquisition of such Option or Right and (ii) that in the event of termination of service of such director, other than as a result of removal without cause, such director will not, for a period to be fixed at the time of the grant of the Option or Right, enter into any other employment or participate directly or indirectly in any other business or enterprise which is competitive with the business of the Company or any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company, or enter into any employment in which such director will be called upon to utilize special knowledge obtained through service as a director of the Company or any
 
subsidiary corporation or parent corporation thereof. In no event will a director who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") be entitled to sell or otherwise dispose of any Shares acquired pursuant to exercise of any such Options or Rights for a period of six (6) months from the date of the acquisition of such Options or Rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall not have the authority to reprice any outstanding Option or Right without stockholder approval.
     The determination of the Board or Committee on matters referred to in this Article III shall be conclusive.
     The Board or Committee may employ such legal counsel, consultants and agents as it may deem desirable for the administration of the Plan and may rely upon any opinion or computation received from any such legal counsel, consultant or agent. Expenses incurred in the engagement of such counsel, consultant or agent shall be paid by the Company. No member or former member of the Board or Committee shall be liable for any action or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any award of Options or Rights granted hereunder.
     
IV. ELIGIBILITY
     Options and Rights may be granted only to non-employee directors of the Company or of any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company, except as hereinafter provided. Any person who shall cease to serve on the Board or a subsidiary corporation or parent corporation thereof, although such person shall have entered into a consulting contract with the Company or a subsidiary corporation or parent corporation thereof, shall not be eligible to receive an Option or a Right.
     The Plan does not create a right in any director to participate in the Plan, nor does it create a right in any director to have any Options or Rights granted to him or her.
     
V. OPTION PRICE AND PAYMENT
     The price for each Share purchasable under any Option granted hereunder shall be such amount as the Committee shall deem appropriate but not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value per share at the date the Option is granted.
     If the Shares are listed on a national securities exchange in the United States (which, for purposes of this Article V, shall be deemed to include any last sale reported over-the-counter market), on any date on which the fair market value per Share shall be deemed to be the average of the high and low quotations at which such Shares are sold on such national securities exchange on the date such Option is granted. If the Shares are listed on a national securities exchange in the United States on such date, but the Shares are not traded on such date, or such national securities exchange is not open for business on such date, the fair market value per Share shall be determined as of the closest preceding date on which such exchange shall have been open for business and the Shares shall have been traded. If the Shares are listed on more than one national securities exchange in the United States on the date on which the fair market value per Share is to be determined, the Committee shall determine which national securities exchange shall be used for the purpose of determining the fair market value per Share.
 
     If a public market exists for the Shares on any date on which the fair market value per Share is to be determined but the Shares are not listed on a national securities exchange in the United States, the fair market value per Share shall be deemed to be the mean between the closing bid and asked quotations in the over-the-counter market for the Shares on such date. If there are no bid and asked quotations for the Shares on such date, the fair market value per Share shall be deemed to be the mean between the closing bid and asked quotations in the over-the-counter market for the Shares on the closest date preceding such date for which such quotations are available.
     If no public market exists for the Shares on any date on which the fair market value per Share is to be determined, the Committee shall, in its sole discretion and best judgment, determine the fair market value of a Share.
     For purposes of this Plan, the determination by the Committee of the fair market value of a Share shall be conclusive.
     Upon the exercise of an Option granted hereunder, the Company shall cause the purchased Shares to be issued only when it shall have received the full purchase price for the Shares in cash or by certified check; , , that in lieu of cash, the holder of an Option may, if and to the extent the terms of such Option so provide and to the extent permitted by applicable law, exercise an Option (a) in whole or in part, by delivering to the Company shares of common stock of the Company (in proper form for transfer and accompanied by all requisite stock transfer tax stamps or cash in lieu thereof) owned by such holder having a fair market value equal to the exercise price applicable to that portion of the Option being exercised by the delivery of such Shares or (b) in part, by delivering to the Company an executed promissory note on such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine, at the time of grant, in its sole discretion; , , that the principal amount of such note shall not exceed eighty percent (80%) (or such lesser percentage as would be permitted by applicable margin regulations) of the aggregate purchase price of the Shares then being purchased pursuant to the exercise of such Option. The fair market value of the stock so delivered shall be determined as of the date immediately preceding the date on which the Option is exercised, or as may be required in order to comply with or to conform to the requirements of any applicable laws or regulations.

VI. USE OF PROCEEDS
     The cash proceeds of the sale of Shares pursuant to the Plan are to be added to the general funds of the Company and used for its general Corporate purposes as the Board shall determine.
     
VII. TERM OF OPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE RIGHT OF EXERCISE
     Any Option shall be exercisable at such times, in such amounts and during such period or periods as the Board or Committee shall determine at the date of the grant of such Option.
     Subject to the provisions of Article XVIII, the Board or Committee shall have the right to accelerate, in whole or in part, from time to time, conditionally or unconditionally, rights to exercise any Option granted hereunder.
 
     To the extent that an Option is not exercised within the period of exercisability specified therein, it shall expire as to the then unexercised part.
     In no event shall an Option granted hereunder be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
     
VIII. EXERCISE OF OPTIONS
     Options granted under the Plan shall be exercised by the optionee as to all or part of the Shares covered thereby by the giving of written notice of the exercise thereof to the Corporate Secretary of the Company at the principal business office of the Company, specifying the number of Shares to be purchased and specifying a business day not more than fifteen (15) days from the date such notice is given for the payment of the purchase price against delivery of the Shares being purchased. Subject to the terms of Articles XIV, XVI, and XVII, the Company shall cause certificates for the Shares so purchased to be delivered to the optionee at the principal business office of the Company, against payment of the full purchase price, on the date specified in the notice of exercise.
     
IX. STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
     In the discretion of the Board or Committee, a Right may be granted (i) alone, (ii) simultaneously with the grant of an Option and in conjunction therewith or in the alternative thereto or (iii) subsequent to the grant of an Option and in conjunction therewith or in the alternative thereto.
     The exercise price of a Right granted alone shall be determined by the Board or Committee but shall not be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value of one Share on the date of grant of such Right. A Right granted simultaneously with or subsequent to the grant of an Option and in conjunction therewith or in the alternative thereto shall have the same exercise price as the related Option, shall be transferable only upon the same terms and conditions as the related Option, and shall be exercisable only to the same extent as the related Option; , , that a Right, by its terms, shall be exercisable only when the fair market value of the Shares subject to the Right and related Option exceeds the exercise price thereof.
provided
however
     Upon exercise of a Right granted simultaneously with or subsequent to an Option and in the alternative thereto, the number of Shares for which the related Option shall be exercisable shall be reduced by the number of Shares for which the Right shall have been exercised. The number of Shares for which a Right shall be exercisable shall be reduced upon any exercise of a related Option by the number of Shares for which such Option shall have been exercised.
     Any Right shall be exercisable upon such additional terms and conditions as may from time to time be prescribed by the Board or Committee.
     A Right shall entitle the holder upon exercise thereof to receive from the Company, upon a written request filed with the Corporate Secretary of the Company at its principal offices (the "Request"), a number of Shares (with or without restrictions as to substantial risk of forfeiture and transferability, as determined by the Board in its sole discretion), an amount of cash, or any combination of Shares and cash, as specified in the Request (but subject to the approval of the
 
Board in its sole discretion, at any time up to and including the time of payment, as to the making of any cash payment), having an aggregate fair market value equal to the product of (i) the excess of the fair market value, on the day of such Request, of one Share over the exercise price per share specified in such Right or its related Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of Shares for which such Right shall be exercised.
     Any election by a holder of a Right to receive cash in full or partial settlement of such Right, and any exercise of such Right for cash, may be made only by a Request filed with the Corporate Secretary of the Company during the period beginning on the third business day following the date of release for publication by the Company of quarterly or annual summary statements of sales and earnings and ending on the twelfth business day following such date. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt by the Company of a Request to receive cash in full or partial settlement of a Right or to exercise such Right for cash, the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, either consent to or disapprove, in whole or in part, such Request. A Request to receive cash in full or partial settlement of a Right or to exercise a Right for cash may provide that, in the event the Board shall disapprove such Request, such Request shall be deemed to be an exercise of such Right for Shares.
     If the Board disapproves in whole or in part any election by a holder to receive cash in full or partial settlement of a Right or to exercise such Right for cash, such disapproval shall not affect such holder's right to exercise such Right at a later date, to the extent that such Right shall be otherwise exercisable, or to elect the form of payment at a later date, provided that an election to receive cash upon such later exercise shall be subject to the approval of the Board. Additionally, such disapproval shall not affect such holder's right to exercise any related Option or Options granted to such holder under the Plan.
     A holder of a Right shall not be entitled to request or receive cash in full or partial payment of such Right unless such Right shall have been held for six (6) months from the date of acquisition to the date of cash settlement thereof; , , that such prohibition shall not apply if the holder of such Right is not subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.
provided
however
     A Right shall be deemed exercised on the last day of its term, if not otherwise exercised by the holder thereof, provided that the fair market value of the Shares subject to the Right exceeds the exercise price thereof on such date.
     For all purposes of this Article IX, the fair market value of Shares shall be determined in accordance with the principles set forth in Article V.
     
X. NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
     Neither an Option nor a Right granted hereunder shall be transferable, whether by operation of law or otherwise, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and any Option or Right granted hereunder shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the holder only by such holder. Except to the extent provided above, Options and Rights may not be assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or disposed of in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) and shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process.
 
     
XI. TERMINATION OF SERVICE
     Upon the cessation of such person's status as a director of the Company and all subsidiary corporations and parent corporations of the Company, an Option or Right previously granted to the director, unless otherwise specified by the Board or Committee in the Option or Right, shall, to the extent not theretofore exercised, terminate and become null and void, provided that:
          (a) if the director shall die while serving as a director of such corporation or during either the three (3) month or one (1) year period, whichever is applicable, specified in clause (b) below and at a time when such director was entitled to exercise an Option or Right as herein provided, the legal representative of such director, or such person who acquired such Option or Right by bequest or inheritance or by reason of the death of the director, may, not later than one (1) year from the date of death, exercise such Option or Right, to the extent not theretofore exercised, in respect of any or all of such number of Shares as specified by the Board or Committee in such Option or Right; and
          (b) if the service of any director to whom such Option or Right shall have been granted shall terminate by reason of the director's retirement (at such age or upon such conditions as shall be specified by the Board), disability (as described in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code) or removal other than for cause (as defined below), and while such director is entitled to exercise such Option or Right as herein provided, such director shall have the right to exercise such Option or Right so granted, to the extent not theretofore exercised, in respect of any or all of such number of Shares as specified by the Board or Committee in such Option or Right, at any time up to and including (i) three (3) months after the date of such termination of service in the case of termination by reason of retirement or removal other than for cause and (ii) one (1) year after the date of termination of service in the case of termination by reason of disability.
     If a director voluntarily terminates his or her service, or is discharged for cause, any Option or Right granted hereunder shall, unless otherwise specified by the Board or Committee in the Option or Right, forthwith terminate with respect to any unexercised portion thereof.
     If an Option or Right granted hereunder shall be exercised by the legal representative of a deceased or disabled director or former director, or by a person who acquired an Option or Right granted hereunder by bequest or inheritance or by reason of death of any director or former director, written notice of such exercise shall be accompanied by a certified copy of letters testamentary or equivalent proof of the right of such legal representative or other person to exercise such Option or Right.
     For the purposes of the Plan, the term "for cause" shall mean (i) with respect to a director who is party to a written agreement with, or, alternatively, participates in a compensation or benefit plan of the Company or a subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company, which agreement or plan contains a definition of "for cause" or "cause" (or words of like import) for purposes of termination of service thereunder, "for cause" or "cause" as defined in the most recent of such agreements or plans, or (ii) in all other cases, as determined by the Board in its sole discretion, (a) the willful commission by a director of a criminal or other act that causes or
 
probably will cause substantial economic damage to the Company or a subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company or substantial injury to the business reputation of the Company or a subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company; (b) the commission by a director of an act of fraud in the performance of such director's duties on behalf of the Company or a subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company; or (c) the continuing willful failure of a director to perform the duties of such director to the Company or a subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company (other than such failure resulting from the director's incapacity due to physical or mental illness) after written notice thereof (specifying the particulars thereof in reasonable detail) and a reasonable opportunity to be heard and cure such failure are given to the director by the Board or the Committee. For purposes of the Plan, no act, or failure to act, on the director's part shall be considered "willful" unless done or omitted to be done by the director not in good faith and without reasonable belief that the director's action or omission was in the best interest of the Company or a subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company.
     In the event of the complete liquidation or dissolution of a subsidiary corporation, or in the event that the Company ceases to own, directly or indirectly, stock possessing fifty percent (50%) or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of such corporation, any unexercised Options or Rights theretofore granted to any person who served as a director of such subsidiary corporation will be deemed canceled unless such person serves on the Board or board of directors of any parent corporation or another subsidiary corporation after the occurrence of such event. In the event an Option or Right is to be canceled pursuant to the provisions of the previous sentence, notice of such cancellation will be given to each director holding unexercised Options or Rights and such holder will have the right to exercise such Options or Rights in full (without regard to any limitation set forth or imposed pursuant to Article VII) during the thirty (30) day period following notice of such cancellation.
     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article XI, in no event, however, shall any person be entitled to exercise any Option or Right after the expiration of the period of exercisability of such Option or Right as specified therein.
     
XII. ADJUSTMENT OF SHARES; EFFECT OF CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS
     In the event of any change in the outstanding Shares through merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, split-up, split-off, spin-off, combination of shares, exchange of shares, or other like change in capital structure of the Company, the Board or Committee shall make such adjustment to each outstanding Option and Right that it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate. The term "Shares" after any such change shall refer to the securities, cash and/or property then receivable upon exercise of an Option or Right. In addition, in the event of any such change, the Board or Committee shall make any further adjustment as may be appropriate to the maximum number of Shares which may be acquired under the Plan pursuant to the exercise of Options and Rights, the maximum number of Shares which may be so acquired by one director and the number of Shares and prices per Share subject to outstanding Options and Rights as shall be equitable to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights under such Options or Rights, and the determination of the Board or Committee as to these matters shall be conclusive.
 
     In the event of a "change in control" of the Company, all then outstanding Options and Rights shall immediately become exercisable. For purposes of the Plan, a "change in control" of the Company occurs if: (a) any "Person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing (i) fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then-outstanding securities; or (ii) twenty-five percent (25%) or more but less than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities if such transaction(s) giving rise to such beneficial ownership are not approved by the Board; or (b) at any time a majority of the members of the Board has been elected or designated by any Person; or (c) the Board shall approve a sale of all or substantially all of the assets, the result of which would be the occurrence of any event described in clause (a) or (b) above.
     The Board or Committee, in its discretion, may determine that, upon the occurrence of a transaction described in the preceding paragraph, each Option or Right outstanding hereunder shall terminate within a specified number of days after notice to the holder, and such holder shall receive, with respect to each Share subject to such Option or Right, cash in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such Shares immediately prior to the occurrence of such transaction over the exercise price per share of such Option or Right.
     
XIII. RIGHT TO TERMINATE SERVICE
     The Plan shall not impose any obligation on the Company or on any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation thereof to continue the service of any holder of Options or Rights and it shall not impose any obligation on the part of any holder of Options or Rights to remain in the service of the Company or of any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation thereof.
     
XIV. PURCHASE FOR INVESTMENT
     Except for hereinafter provided, the Board or Committee may require a director, as a condition upon exercise of any Option or Right granted hereunder, to execute and deliver to the Company (a) stock powers with respect to Shares underlying a particular Option or Right and required to be held by a custodian, and (b) a written statement, in form satisfactory to the Board or Committee in which the director represents and warrants that Shares are being acquired for such person's own account for investment only and not with a view to the resale or distribution thereof. The director shall, at the request of the Board or Committee, be required to represent and warrant in writing that any subsequent resale or distribution of Shares by the director shall be made only pursuant to either (i) a Registration Statement on an appropriate form under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), which Registration Statement has become effective and is current with regard to the Shares being sold, or (ii) a specific exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, but in claiming such exemption the director shall, prior to any offer of sale or sale of such Shares, obtain a prior favorable written opinion of counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to counsel for the Company, as to the application of such exemption thereto. The foregoing restriction shall not apply to (i) issuances by the Company so long as the Shares being issued are registered under the Securities Act and a prospectus in respect thereof is current or (ii) re-offerings of Shares by affiliates of the Company
 
(as defined in Rule 405 or any successor rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act) if the Shares being re-offered are registered under the Securities Act and a prospectus in respect thereof is current.
     
XV. ISSUE OF CERTIFICATES, LEGENDS, PAYMENT OF EXPENSES
     Upon any exercise of an Option or Right which may be granted hereunder and, in the case of an Option, payment of the purchase price, a certificate or certificates for the Shares shall be issued by the Company in the name of the person exercising the Option or Right and shall be delivered to or upon the order of such person.
     The Company may endorse such legend or legends upon the certificates for Shares issued pursuant to the Plan and may issue such "stop transfer" instructions to its transfer agent in respect of such Shares as, in its discretion, it determines to be necessary or appropriate to (i) prevent a violation of, or to perfect an exemption from, the registration requirements of the Securities Act, or (ii) implement the provisions of the Plan and any agreement between the Company and the optionee or grantee with respect to such Shares.
     The Company shall pay all issue or transfer taxes with respect to the issuance of transfer of Shares, as well as all fees and expenses necessarily incurred by the Company in connection with such issuance or transfer, except fees and expenses which may be necessitated by the filing or amending of a Registration Statement under the Securities Act, which fees and expenses shall be borne by the recipient of the Shares unless such Registration Statement has been filed by the Company for its own corporate purposes (and the Company so states) in which event the recipient of the Shares shall bear only fees and expenses as are attributable solely to the inclusion of the Shares he or she receives in the Registration Statement.
     All Shares issued as provided herein shall be fully paid and non-assessable to the extent permitted by law.
     
XVI. LISTING OF SHARES AND RELATED MATTERS
     The Board or Committee may delay any award, issuance or delivery of Shares if it determines that listing, registration or qualification of Shares or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the sale or purchase of Shares under the Plan, until such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained, or otherwise provided for, free of any conditions not acceptable to the Committee.
     
XVII. AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN
     The Board or the Committee, as the case may be, may, from time to time, amend the Plan, provided that no amendment shall be made, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company, that will (i) increase the total number of Shares reserved for Options under the Plan (other than an increase resulting from an adjustment provided for in Article XII), (ii) reduce the exercise price of any Option granted hereunder below the price required by Article V, (iii) modify the provisions of the Plan relating to eligibility, or (iv) materially increase the benefits accruing to participants under the Plan. The rights and obligations under any Option or Right
 
granted before amendment of the Plan or any unexercised portion of such Option or Right shall not be adversely affected by amendment of the Plan, Option or Right without the consent of the holder of such Option or Right.
     
XVIII. TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF THE PLAN
     The Board may at any time suspend or terminate the Plan. The Plan, unless sooner terminated by action of the Board, shall terminate at the close of business on the Termination Date. Options and Rights may not be granted while the Plan is suspended or after it is terminated. Rights and obligations under any Option or Right granted while the Plan is in effect shall not be altered or impaired by suspension or termination of the Plan, except upon the consent of the person to whom the Option or Right was granted. The power of the Board or Committee to construe and administer any Options or Rights granted prior to the termination or suspension of the Plan under Article III nevertheless shall continue after such termination or during such suspension.
     
XIX. GOVERNING LAW

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Norstan, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Norstan, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of April 30, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States of America). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

NORSTAN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1  Nature of Business:
     Norstan, Inc. (Norstan, the Company, we, us, or our) is a full-service communications solutions and services company delivering voice and data technologies and services, and remanufactured equipment to corporate end-users and public sector companies. Norstan offers a full range of technologies for customer contact solutions and converged solutions, including applications such as messaging, conferencing and enterprise mobility. Additionally, we provide a host of communications services including ProtectNet Life Cycle services, project management, implementation, field delivery, voice and data network monitoring, and managed and professional services.
     Norstan operates principally through its subsidiaries: Norstan Communications, Inc., Norstan Canada, Ltd., Vibes Technologies, Inc. and Norstan Financial Services, Inc. Headquartered in Minnetonka, Minnesota, we have sales and services locations in the United States and Canada. Norstan's common stock is listed on the NASDAQ stock market under the symbol NRRD. Our mission is to improve the way our customers communicate. We offer a broad array of technology platforms, software solutions and on-going system maintenance services. Currently, we work with approximately 2,400 key customers, and have serviced approximately 12,000 sites over the past two years. We draw customers from a variety of industry groups.
     We have established strategic relationships with market leading communications manufacturers that enable our ability to offer best-in-class, custom-tailored solutions to our customers. Norstan maintains 25 sales and service locations and 5 distribution centers in the United States and Canada. We serve numerous customer sites across a broad range of industries and focus our marketing efforts on middle-market and Fortune 2000 companies with complex technology and communications requirements. We believe our service capabilities will enable Norstan to capture a greater portion of each customer's communication budgets in the future, as well as, provide other growth opportunities through multi-channel marketing.
Note 2  Acquisition
     In March 2003, we purchased certain assets and intellectual property from NetCom Systems, Inc. (NetCom) related to NetCom's voice over IP telephony applications software operations. The acquisition consideration totaled $3.0 million, consisting of a cash payment of $1.1 million at closing and $1.1 million 120 days after the closing and guaranteed payments of $800,000 payable over the next two years ($400,000 paid April 2004 with the remaining $400,000 due April 2005). The purchase agreement provides that we may pay NetCom contingent consideration up to $3.0 million based on the amount of new software license fees received by Norstan during the two-year period following the closing. At our discretion, up to 50% of any contingent consideration may be paid in shares of Norstan's common stock. We have and will continue to fund the purchase of these assets from borrowings under our credit facility. We also hired certain key NetCom personnel who were involved in NetCom's development of IP telephony applications software. This group is doing business as Norstan Convergence Development Group and its results of operations are included in our Communications Solutions and Services segment.
     The following table summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired as determined by an independent appraisal (in thousands):
     The amortizable intangible assets relating to proprietary technology are being amortized over five years on a straight-line basis. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," the goodwill acquired in the acquisition is not amortized. Any contingent consideration that we may be required to pay will be accounted for as additional goodwill. The intangible assets and goodwill acquired have been allocated to our Communications Solutions and Services business segment. Pro forma results related to the acquisition were not material to our financial condition or results of operations.
 
Note 3  Discontinued Operations
Network Services:
     In February 2002, we agreed to sell our Network Services business to NetWolves Corporation (NASDAQ: WOLV) for $7.5 million. The transaction was effective on July 1, 2002. Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, $3.75 million was received at closing and the remaining $3.75 million was due one year from closing, evidenced by a non-interest bearing promissory note in favor of Norstan. We recorded a pre-tax gain on this sale of $2.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 based on the $3.75 million cash received. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we received payment of $2.9 million in cash as well as other non-monetary assets in early settlement of the promissory note. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $2.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 based on the amount of cash received in settlement of the promissory note. The non-monetary asset, consisting of 300,000 shares of unregistered NetWolves Corporation common stock, has been reflected at a zero value until such time as the unregistered common stock is monetized or monetizable. Network Services provided multiple source long distance services and related consulting and professional services. Because of the sale of this business unit, Network Services results of operations have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
Consulting:
     During fiscal 2001, we divested our IT consulting business in order to focus on our core competencies of providing communications technology services and solutions to direct enterprise customers and channel partners. In addition to refocusing our strategy, the absence of realized synergies between our communications and IT consulting businesses and recurring losses within the consulting business contributed to our decision to divest of this non-strategic business segment. Our IT consulting business results are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
Financial Information Related to Discontinued Operations:
     Net assets (liabilities) of discontinued operations included the following (in thousands):
 
     We recorded a gain on the disposal of discontinued operations of $366,000, net of tax, in fiscal 2004. This gain on disposal resulted primarily from the sale of certain properties we received as part of the Vadini settlement related to the February 2002 arbitration award (see Note 12).
Note 4  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
Principles of Consolidation:
     The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Norstan, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates:
     The preparation of our financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. Estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Estimates are used for such items as allowances for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation, depreciable lives of property and equipment, valuation of deferred tax assets, warranty reserves, estimates of percentage of completion under long-term contracts and others. Ultimate results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition:
     Within our Communications Solutions and Services business segment, revenues from the sale and installation of products and systems are recognized under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for long-term contracts. Revenues from maintenance service contracts, moves, adds, and changes, and network integration services, are recognized as the services are provided and financial services' revenues are recognized over the life of the related lease receivables using the effective interest method. Resale Services' revenues are generated from the secondary equipment market and are recognized upon performance of contractual obligations, which is generally upon shipment. In addition, we grant credit to our customers and generally do not require collateral or any other security to support amounts due.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
     Fair values of financial instruments, including long-term obligations, lease receivables and trade receivables, approximated their carrying values at April 30, 2004 because of their short maturity or variable interest rate nature, except for discounted lease rentals for which book value was $3.6 million as compared to estimated fair value of $3.4 million as of April 30, 2004.
Inventories:
     Inventories include purchased parts and equipment and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a weighted-average cost basis, or estimated realizable value.
Property and Equipment:
     Property and equipment are stated at cost and include expenditures that increase the useful lives of existing property and equipment. Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged to operations as incurred. When property and equipment are disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in operations. Property and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of two to ten years under the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes. Accelerated methods of depreciation are used for income tax reporting.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets," in determining whether an impairment has occurred, our policy is to evaluate, at each balance sheet date, whether events and circumstances have taken place to indicate that the book value of our assets may not be recoverable. If such indicators were present, impairment would be assessed using estimates of undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the book values of the assets, the assets would be written down to their estimated fair values. There were no writedowns recorded under SFAS No. 144 in fiscal 2004 except for those included in restructuring and other charges (see Note 5).
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets:
     Pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 142, we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances warrant using a fair value approach. We have performed the required tests regarding the realizability of the recorded goodwill and determined that no impairment charge was required in fiscal 2004. In addition, we recorded amortization expense of $534,000 in fiscal 2004, related to the intangible assets acquired as part of our fiscal 2003 IP telephony applications software acquisition from NetCom (see Note 2). The amortization expense is included in our selling, general and administrative expenses.
     The components of goodwill and other intangible assets were as follows as of April 30, (in thousands):
     The change in the gross carrying amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets for the year ended April 30, were as follows (in thousands):
     The weighted average amortization period related to our intangible assets is five years. The following table sets forth our estimate of amortization expenses related to other intangible assets for each of the next five years (in thousands):
 
Warranty:
     We are subject to warranty claims for products and overall solutions that may fail to perform as expected due to design, installation or manufacturing deficiencies. Customers continue to require their outside suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products/solutions and bear the cost of repair or replacement of such products/solutions. Depending on the terms under which we supply products/solutions to our customers, a customer may hold us responsible for some or all of the repair, replacement or redesign/reinstallation costs of defective products/solutions, when the product/solution supplied did not perform as represented. We generally provide customers a warranty on products consistent with the warranty we receive from the original equipment manufacturer. In most instances, the original equipment manufacturer bears the cost to replace defective products. We provide the necessary labor to redesign, reinstall or replace products/solutions that did not perform as represented. Our policy is to reserve for estimated future costs based upon historical trends of actual costs incurred. The warranty reserve is included in other accrued liabilities within our consolidated balance sheets.
     The following table presents a summary of the warranty provision (in thousands):
Foreign Currency:
     For our foreign operations, assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of shareholders' equity within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
Income Taxes:
     Deferred income taxes are provided for differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at currently enacted tax rates.
 
Earnings (Loss) Per Share Data:
     Norstan reports net income (loss) per share pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share." SFAS No. 128 requires presentation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (EPS). Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects potential dilution from all outstanding stock options and other securities using the treasury stock method.
     A reconciliation of EPS calculations under SFAS No. 128 was as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):
     For fiscal 2004, approximately 2.0 million common stock equivalents have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as required under SFAS No. 128, as the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
Comprehensive Income (Loss):
     We report comprehensive income (loss) and its components pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income". For Norstan, comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) adjusted for foreign currency translation adjustments and is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity.
Supplemental Cash Flow Information:
     Supplemental disclosure of cash flow information was as follows (in thousands):
 
Recently Issued Accounting Standards:
     In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46"). FIN 46 requires a variable interest entity ("VIE") to be consolidated when a company is subject to the majority of the risk of loss from the VIE's activities or is entitled to receive the majority of the entity's residual returns, or both. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to FIN 46 ("FIN 46R") which partially delayed the effective date of the interpretation to March 31, 2004 and added additional scope exceptions. The adoption of FIN 46R did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows as we do not have a VIE.
     In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity." SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise became effective September 30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Note 5  Restructuring and Other Charges:
     During the second quarter of fiscal 2004, we recorded restructuring and other charges of $4.2 million, consisting of a restructuring charge of $3.7 million and a write-off of certain fixed assets of approximately $500,000. These charges were primarily within our Communications Solutions and Services segment and relate to actions completed by the end of our second fiscal quarter. The restructuring charge of $3.7 million related to a workforce reduction of approximately 150 people as we continued to right-size our organization and bring our expense structure in-line with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for our solutions and services. This charge consisted of $3.3 million in severance costs and other related employment benefits, together with $400,000 in lease termination and other facility costs. In addition, we recorded a charge of approximately $500,000 for the write-off of certain assets. These assets consisted primarily of non-recoverable capitalized system applications costs and other hardware costs.
     During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we recorded additional restructuring and other charges of $9.4 million. Approximately $7.2 million of this amount was for our reorganization efforts announced in February 2004. Included in these efforts was a reorganization of our Communications Solutions and Services segment to better focus our efforts and to streamline sales and services to improve profitability. Solutions and Services now concentrates customer acquisition and retention efforts into two geographically focused business units. In addition, our sales support and service functions have been realigned to better serve our solutions and services team and our customers' needs. This restructuring charge includes $2.4 million in costs associated with employee and severance costs related to a workforce reduction of 100 people (80 were terminated as of April 30, 2004), $3.9 million related to facilities exit and other contractual costs, and $831,000 in other asset impairment charges. The remaining $2.2 million charge relates to a claim made by the Universal Services Administrative Company (USAC) regarding a specific E-rate project completed by Norstan. The USAC is seeking a recovery of amounts dispursed by the USAC to Norstan on behalf of one of our customers. We are appealing this claim. However, as we may be required to repay a portion or all of the disputed funding, we have established the requisite reserve (see Note 12).
     As of April 30, 2004, there remained reserves of approximately $8.6 million in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet; $5.8 million included in other accrued current liabilities and $2.8 million in other long-term liabilities. We anticipate the majority of the remaining restructuring costs will be paid by the end of our second quarter in fiscal 2005 with the exception of certain facility costs which will extend through fiscal 2012.
 
     The following table summarizes the restructuring and other charges taken during fiscal 2004 and the remaining reserves reflected on our consolidated balance sheet (in thousands):
Note 6  Lease Receivables:
     Norstan financed customer equipment purchases in the amount of $97,000 during fiscal 2004. The decline from prior years is a result of our strategic decision not to offer financing directly to our customers. Leases are primarily accounted for as sales-type leases for financial reporting purposes.
     The components of lease receivables outstanding were as follows (in thousands):
     The aggregate amount of gross lease receivables maturing in each of the three years following April 30, 2004 is as follows (in thousands):
Note 7  Debt Obligations:
Long-Term Debt:
     Long-term debt consisted of the following (in thousands):
 
Aggregate maturities of long-term debt as of April 30, 2004 were as follows (in thousands):
Bank Financing:
     In December 2003, we entered into a new five year $27.5 million secured credit agreement with Wells Fargo Foothill, Inc. consisting of the following components: A) a $5.0 million revolving credit facility, and B) a $22.5 million term loan payable in 30 monthly installments of $333,333 beginning on February 1, 2004, with the remaining unpaid principal due and payable upon maturity at December 9, 2008. Availability under the revolving credit facility is generally based on a percentage of eligible recurring service and maintenance revenues, as defined. This credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets.
     The $5.0 million revolving credit facility currently bears interest at the bank's reference rate plus 2.0% or LIBOR plus 4.0% with provisions for future rate reductions based on certain of our financial ratios. The term loan bears interest at the bank's reference rate plus 3.5%. Annual unused line fees on the revolver are 0.5% and other monthly and annual fees are due to the lender throughout the duration of the agreement. In addition, we are required to meet certain financial and other covenants, including maintaining $2.0 million in excess availability. The agreement requires us to maintain, on a quarterly basis, minimum levels of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and limits our capital expenditures on an annual basis. As of April 30, 2004, borrowings under this agreement were $20.8 million with an average interest rate of 7.5%. We were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants as of April 30, 2004.
     Proceeds from the new term note were used to repay and terminate our previous credit agreement. As a result of the termination of our previous credit agreement, we wrote-off the remaining $162,000 in unamortized debt financing costs during the third quarter of fiscal 2004. In connection with our new secured credit agreement, we capitalized approximately $575,000 in debt financing costs which are being amortized over the term of the new agreement.
     Prior to December 10, 2003, Norstan operated under a previous credit agreement with certain banks, as amended from time to time, consisting of a revolving line of credit and term loan, each secured by substantially all the assets of Norstan. The previous credit agreement provided for interest at various rates ranging from the banks' reference rate plus 0.5% to the reference rate plus 2.0%, or the Eurodollar rate advance plus 2.5% to the Eurodollar rate advance plus 4.0%, plus annual commitment fees ranging from 0.375% to 0.25%.
     We believe that a combination of cash expected to be generated from operations and borrowing capacity available under our current financing arrangements will be adequate to fund anticipated operating activities, capital expenditures and debt repayments until at least April 30, 2005. There is no assurance that the assumptions used by management in formulating this assessment will prove accurate or that additional financing, if needed, will be available in the future on acceptable terms.
 
Note 8  Discounted Lease Rentals:
     We have historically utilized our lease receivables and corresponding underlying equipment to borrow funds from financial institutions at fixed rates on a nonrecourse basis by discounting the stream of future lease payments. Proceeds from discounting are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as discounted lease rentals. Interest rates on these credit agreements range from 6.0% to 8.0% and payments are generally due in varying monthly installments through March 2007.
     Discounted lease rentals consisted of the following (in thousands):
     Aggregate maturities of discounted lease rentals as of April 30, 2004 were as follows (in thousands):
Note 9  Income Taxes:
     The domestic and foreign components of loss from continuing operations before the income tax benefit were as follows (in thousands):
     The benefit for income taxes (including continuing and discontinued operations) consisted of the following (in thousands):
 
     Total income tax expense (benefit) was allocated as follows (in thousands):
     The differences between taxes provided at our effective tax rate and income taxes computed using the federal statutory rate were as follows:
     The tax effects of significant temporary differences representing deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in thousands):
     In fiscal 2004, we recorded a tax benefit for the net operating losses generated in the U.S. and Canada. We believe that this net operating loss carryforward is realizable based on our improved quarterly operating results (excluding restructuring and other charges) achieved during fiscal 2004, our projections of fiscal 2005, and long-term projections of taxable income.
     Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income. With our results of operations in fiscal 2004 and management's expectations for fiscal 2005 and beyond, management believes that it is more likely than not that the recorded assets will be realized. Should our operating strategies fail to produce sufficient taxable income in the future, we would need to record a valuation allowance in the appropriate future reporting period as required by generally accepted accounting principles. Our U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $15.8 million expire from 2020 to 2021, and our Canadian net operating loss carryforwards of $6.8 million expire through fiscal 2011.
 
Note 10  Shareholders Equity:
Stock Option Plans:
     The 1986 Long-Term Incentive Plan of Norstan, Inc. (1986 Plan) provided for the granting of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options and restricted stock. The 1986 Plan, as amended in fiscal 1994, provided for a maximum of 1,600,000 shares to be granted to key employees in the form of stock options or restricted stock. As of September 20, 1995, with the adoption of a successor plan, no additional grants will be issued under the 1986 Plan.
     The Norstan, Inc. 1995 Long-Term Incentive Plan (1995 Plan) permits the granting of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock, providing for a maximum of 3,900,000 shares to be granted as performance awards and other stock-based awards. Stock options are granted at a price equal to the market price on the date of grant, are generally exercisable at 33% per year and generally expire after ten years. At April 30, 2004, 851,253 shares were available for future grants.
     The Restated Non-Employee Directors' Stock Plan (Directors' Plan) provides for a maximum of 650,000 shares to be granted. As determined by our Board of Directors, options for 20,000 shares are to be granted to each non-employee director of Norstan upon election and are generally exercisable over four years. Additional discretionary stock options may be awarded upon board approval and are generally exercisable immediately. All options are granted at a price equal to the market price on the date of grant and generally expire after ten years. In addition, the Directors' Plan provides for the ability to pay annual retainers to each non-employee director on the date of the annual meeting of shareholders. As of April 30, 2004, 65,470 shares had been issued as annual retainers and 140,530 shares were available for future grant/payment under the Directors' Plan.
     Shares subject to option were as follows:
 
     Additional information regarding options outstanding/exercisable at April 30, 2004 was as follows:
     We have awarded restricted stock grants to selected employees under the 1986 Plan and the 1995 Plan. Recipients of restricted stock awards under these plans were not required to make any payments for the stock or provide consideration other than the rendering of services. Shares of stock awarded under the plans are subject to certain restrictions on transfer and all or part of the shares awarded to an employee may be subject to forfeiture upon the occurrence of certain events, including termination of employment. Restricted shares granted under the 1995 Plan were 111,500 during fiscal 2004. The fair market value of the shares granted under these plans is generally amortized over a three-year period. Amortization expense was $129,000 in fiscal 2004.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan:
     We also have an employee stock purchase plan (the 2000 Employee Stock Plan) that allows employees to set aside up to 10% of their earnings for the purchase of shares of our common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lesser of the closing market price of Norstan's stock on the first or last day of each calendar quarter. The number of shares issued under this plan were 310,028 during fiscal 2004. At April 30, 2004, 287,949 shares were available for future issuance.
Warrants to Purchase Common Stock:
     Under the terms of our former credit agreement (see Note 7) our previous lenders were granted 489,545 warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. These warrants were recorded at their estimated fair value at their respective dates of issuance, with the resulting costs being charged to expense. Such costs were approximately $155,000 and $323,000 in fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively.
     As of April 30, 2004, these former lenders hold warrants to purchase the following shares of our common stock:
 
Stock-Based Compensation:
     We apply APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized in the accompanying statements of operations. Had compensation cost been recognized based on the fair values of options at the grant dates consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", as amended by SFAS No. 148, our net loss (in thousands) and net loss per common share would have changed to the following pro forma amounts:
     The weighted average fair values of options granted under the listed equity plans were as follows:
     The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the weighted-average assumptions used for grants in the year ended April 30, 2004 as follows:
Shareholders' Rights Plan:
     Norstan has a shareholder rights plan, as amended in March 2001 (the Rights Plan), which expires in 2008. Under the Rights Plan, shareholders are deemed the owners of "Rights" attaching to each share of common stock. Generally, upon any person (an Acquiring Person) becoming the owner of 15% or more of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock (a Stock Acquisition Date), each Right will enable the holder to purchase an additional share of Norstan's common stock at a price equal to 50% of the then current market price. In the event that we are acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction where Norstan is not the surviving corporation or 50% or more of our assets or earnings power is sold, each Right entitles the holder to receive, upon exercise of the Right at the then current purchase price of the Right, common stock of the acquiring entity that has a value of two times the purchase price of the Right. The Rights Plan also authorizes Norstan, under certain circumstances, to redeem the Rights at a redemption price of $0.01 per Right and, following any Stock Acquisition Date, to exchange one share of our common stock for each Right held by a shareholder other than an Acquiring Person.
 
Note 11 
401(k)
Plan:
     Norstan has a 401(k) profit-sharing plan (the 401(k) Plan) covering substantially all full-time employees. As of January 1, 2002, eligible employees may elect to defer up to 30% of their eligible compensation (previously 15%). The Company may make discretionary matching contributions on a portion of this deferral and/or qualified non-elective contributions to employee accounts. Our contributions to the 401(k) Plan were $1,794,000 in fiscal 2004.
Note 12  Commitments and Contingencies:
Legal Proceedings:
     In April 2004, we received a Commitment Adjustment Letter from the Universal Services Administrative Company (USAC), which oversees the Federal Communications Commission's School and Libraries Program of the Universal Service Fund, also called the "E-rate program." Funding commitments under the E-rate program provide for discounts on eligible services such as telecommunications services, internet access, network equipment and wiring of instructional buildings and classrooms to connect to the Internet. The letter informed Norstan that USAC had undertaken an audit of the Navajo Preparatory School (Navajo Prep) project for funding year 2001, in which we had installed specific equipment and services for which we received approximately $2.2 million. The audit report concluded that Navajo Prep had not complied with key requirements of the E-rate program and, consistent with E-rate policies, USAC is seeking recovery of the full amount disbursed to Norstan on behalf of Navajo Prep. We have filed an appeal with USAC and we are continuing an investigation of the Navajo Prep project. While we will continue to defend and appeal USAC's decision, we may be required to repay a portion or all of the $2.2 million. Accordingly, we established a reserve of $2.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.
     In February 2002, we were awarded $7.2 million resulting from a claim before the American Arbitration Association against the former owner of PRIMA Consulting (PRIMA) which claims arose out of our September 1997 acquisition of PRIMA. Subsequently, we reached a settlement with the former owner, Mr. Michael Vadini. The settlement provided that Norstan receive $3.0 million in cash, a promissory note issued by Mr. Vadini for $1.0 million to be paid in monthly installments beginning in June 2002, and certain real properties. As a result of the settlement, we recorded a $3.0 million pre-tax gain in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, based on the amount of cash received. We recorded a full reserve against the real property and the promissory note and planned to record any future gains on the sale of the real properties and collection of the promissory note as amounts are assured of realization. In December 2002, after receiving the first six $83,333 monthly installment payments, we agreed to accept a lump sum payment of $470,000 in settlement of the remaining monthly installments which totaled approximately $500,000 at that time. We recorded a gain, net of tax, of approximately $591,000 through discontinued operations relating to payments received on the promissory note during fiscal 2003. In May 2003, one of the real properties was sold and a pre-tax gain of approximately $253,000 was recorded through discontinued operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. In addition, in January 2004, a second real property was sold and a pre-tax gain of approximately $341,000 was recorded through discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2004.
     We are involved in other legal actions in the ordinary course of our business. Although the outcome of any such legal actions cannot be predicted, in the opinion of management there are no other legal proceedings pending against or involving Norstan for which the outcome is likely to have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results or financial condition.
Operating Lease Commitments:
     We conduct our operations in leased facilities. Most of the leases require payment of maintenance, insurance, taxes and other expenses in addition to the minimum annual rentals. Lease expense, as recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, was $7,572,000 in fiscal 2004.
     Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more were as follows at April 30, 2004 (in thousands):
 
     Included in the above amounts is approximately $8.0 million related to the restructuring and other charges (see Note 5).
Vendor Agreements:
     Norstan has been a distributor of Siemens equipment since 1976 and is currently Siemens' largest distributor in North America. The term of the distribution agreement signed in January 1999, was for five years and has been extended one year, currently through January 2005. Our relationship with Siemens is integral to our business. Any significant disruption of this distribution relationship could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
     Norstan and Siemens have been parties in a used equipment alliance in which we managed the acquisition, marketing, refurbishment and resale of Siemens certified used telephony equipment, becoming the largest supplier of Siemens and ROLM refurbished equipment. On July 22, 2004, Siemens Information and Communication Networks, Inc., elected to end their alliance with us in the used equipment business effective at the expiration of the current agreement, July 31, 2004. Effective August 1, 2004, we will continue offering customers refurbished Siemens telephony equipment, in addition to new and used audio and video conferencing systems, wireless solutions, call center accessories, components, desktop products, and services through our Norstan Resale Services Group.
     The termination of this resale alliance does not affect our ongoing distribution agreement with Siemens with respect to new equipment.
     In addition, we maintain relationships with a wide range of leading technology companies including Aspect Communications, Applied Voice and Speech Technologies (AVST), Cisco Systems, Ericsson, Intervoice, Nortel Networks, ScanSoft, SpectraLink, Verint, and Witness Systems.
Note 13  Business Segments and Geographic Areas:
     We deliver our products and services through two business units: Communications Solutions and Services and Resale Services, which accounted for 86.6% and 13.4% of our fiscal 2004 revenues, respectively. Communications Solutions and Services delivers voice and data technologies and services to corporate end-users and public sector companies. Our solutions' portfolio includes a full range of technologies for customer contact solutions and converged solutions, including applications such as messaging, conferencing and enterprise mobility. Additionally, we provide a host of communications services including ProtectNet Life Cycle services, project management, implementation, field delivery, voice and data network monitoring, and managed and professional services. Resale Services offers refurbished voice and data products.
     In evaluating financial performance, management focuses on operating income (loss) as a segment's measure of profit or loss. The accounting policies of our segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note 4).
     Norstan's disclosures under the requirements of SFAS No. 131, "Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information," are as follows:

     The information furnished in this report is unaudited and reflects normal recurring adjustments and such other adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the operating results for the interim periods identified herein pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. This report should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2004. The operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full fiscal year. When we refer to the Company, Norstan, we, us or our, we mean Norstan, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
Principles of Consolidation:
     The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Norstan, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates:
     The preparation of our financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. Estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Estimates are used for such items as allowances for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation, depreciable lives of property and equipment, valuation of deferred tax assets, warranty reserves, estimates of percentage of completion under long-term contracts and others. Ultimate results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition:
     Within our Communications Solutions and Services business segment, revenues from the sale and installation of products and systems are recognized under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for long-term contracts. Revenues from maintenance service contracts, moves, adds, and changes, and network integration services, are recognized as the services are provided and financial services' revenues are recognized over the life of the related lease receivables using the effective interest method. Resale Services' revenues are generated from the secondary equipment market and are recognized upon performance of contractual obligations, which is upon shipment.
Inventories:
     Inventories include purchased parts and equipment and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a weighted-average cost basis, or estimated realizable value.
 
Property and Equipment:
     Property and equipment are stated at cost and include expenditures that increase the useful lives of existing property and equipment. Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged to operations as incurred. When property and equipment are disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in operations. Property and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of two to ten years under the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes. Accelerated methods of depreciation are used for income tax reporting.
     Pursuant to the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets," in determining whether an impairment has occurred, our policy is to evaluate, at each balance sheet date, whether events and circumstances have taken place to indicate that the book value of our assets may not be recoverable. If such indicators were present, impairment would be assessed using estimates of undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the book values of the assets, the assets would be written down to their estimated fair values. There were no writedowns recorded under SFAS No. 144 in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2005 or fiscal 2004, except for those included in restructuring and other charges (see Note 7).
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets:
     Pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 142, we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances warrant using a fair value approach. No circumstances occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 that warranted testing goodwill for impairment. In addition, we recorded amortization expense of $134,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, related to the intangible assets acquired as part of our fiscal 2003 internet protocol (IP) telephony applications software acquisition from NetCom Systems, Inc. (see Note 2). No such amortization expense was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 as all of these intangible assets were sold at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2005.
     In the second quarter of fiscal 2005, we acquired certain intangible assets for $500,000 in cash to facilitate Norstan Resale Services Group's business. These intangible assets are being amortized over 24 months and $63,000 in amortization expense was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The amortization expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
     The components of goodwill and other intangible assets were as follows (in thousands):
     The change in the gross carrying amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets for the six months ended October 30, 2004 were as follows (in thousands):
 
Warranty:
     We are subject to warranty claims for products and overall solutions that may fail to perform as expected due to design, installation or manufacturing deficiencies. Customers continue to require their outside suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products/solutions and bear the cost of repair or replacement of such products/solutions. Depending on the terms under which we supply products/solutions to our customers, a customer may hold us responsible for some or all of the repair, replacement or redesign/reinstallation costs of defective products/solutions, when the product/solution supplied did not perform as represented. We generally provide customers a warranty on products consistent with the warranty we receive from the original equipment manufacturer. In most instances, the original equipment manufacturer bears the cost to replace defective products. We provide the necessary labor to redesign, reinstall or replace products/solutions that did not perform as represented. Our policy is to reserve for estimated future costs based upon historical trends of actual costs incurred. The warranty reserve is included in other accrued liabilities within our consolidated balance sheets.
     The following table presents a summary of the warranty reserve (in thousands):
Foreign Currency:
     For our Canadian operations, assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates as of the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of shareholders' equity within accumulated other comprehensive loss.
Earnings (Loss) Per Share Data:
     Norstan reports net income (loss) per share pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share". SFAS No. 128 requires presentation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (EPS). Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects potential dilution from outstanding stock options and other securities using the treasury stock method.
     A reconciliation of EPS calculations under SFAS No. 128 was as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):
 
     For the comparable six month periods then ended, 1.8 million and 3.3 million weighted average shares have been excluded as the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
Comprehensive Income (Loss):
     We report comprehensive income (loss) and its components pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income". For Norstan, comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) adjusted for foreign currency translation adjustments. Comprehensive income, as defined by SFAS No. 130, for the six month period ended October 30, 2004, was $2.9 million as compared to a loss of $5.2 million for the six months ended November 1, 2003.
Supplemental Cash Flow Information:
     Supplemental disclosure of cash flow information was as follows (in thousands):
 
NOTE 2  NORSTAN CONVERGENCE DEVELOPMENT GROUP:
     In March 2003, we purchased certain assets and intellectual property from NetCom Systems, Inc. (NetCom) related to NetCom's voice over IP telephony applications software operations. The acquisition consideration totaled $3.0 million, consisting of a cash payment of $1.1 million at closing and $1.1 million 120 days after the closing and guaranteed payments of $800,000 payable over the next two years ($400,000 paid April 2004 with the remaining $400,000 due April 2005). The purchase agreement provided that we may pay NetCom contingent consideration up to $3.0 million based on the amount of new software license fees received by Norstan during the two-year period following the closing. We funded the purchase of these assets from borrowings under our credit facility. We also hired certain key NetCom personnel who were involved in NetCom's development of IP telephony applications software. This group comprised our Norstan Convergence Development Group (Norstan CDG) and its results of operations are included in our Communications Solutions and Services segment.
     The following table summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired as determined by an independent appraisal (in thousands):
     The amortizable intangible assets relating to proprietary technology were being amortized over five years on a straight-line basis. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," the goodwill acquired in the acquisition has not been amortized. The intangible assets and goodwill acquired have been allocated to our Communications Solutions and Services business segment. Pro forma results related to the acquisition were not material to our financial condition or results of operations.
     On July 30, 2004, we sold the assets and the intellectual property related to Norstan CDG to IPcelerate, Inc. (IPcelerate), a privately held developer of voice over IP applications, for $2.5 million in cash and promissory notes, and the assumption by the purchaser of approximately $400,000 in liabilities. Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, we received $1.25 million at closing and $1.25 million evidenced by non-interest bearing promissory notes in favor of Norstan ($1.05 million due January 30, 2005 and $200,000 due February 28, 2005). We recorded a pre-tax gain of $88,000 from the sale in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. This gain is comprised of total consideration received and liabilities assumed by IPcelerate (including the payable to NetCom for approximately $400,000 due April 2005) less assets sold (consisting primarily of the remaining unamortized portion of the technology intangible assets) as well as the write-off of the goodwill recorded as part of the original CDG purchase.
NOTE 3 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS:
     In July 2002, we sold our Network Services business to NetWolves Corporation for $7.5 million. Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, $3.75 million was received at closing and the remaining $3.75 million was due one year from closing, evidenced by a non-interest bearing promissory note in favor of Norstan. We recorded a pre-tax gain on this sale of $2.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 based on the $3.75 million cash received. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we received payment of $2.9 million in cash as well as other non-monetary assets in early settlement of the promissory note. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $2.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 based on the amount of cash received in settlement of the promissory note. The non-monetary asset, consisting of 300,000 shares of unregistered NetWolves Corporation common stock, had been reflected at a zero value until such time as the unregistered common stock was monetized or monetizable. On June 2, 2004, these shares were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and, accordingly, we recorded an additional gain on the sale of discontinued operations of $87,000, net of tax, in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. These shares are recorded in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and will be marked-to-market based on changes in NetWolves stock price going forward until such time as they are sold.
 
Network Services provided multiple source long distance services and related consulting and professional services.
     Net assets (liabilities) of discontinued operations included the following (in thousands):
NOTE 4 - INCOME TAXES:
     Deferred income taxes are provided for differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates.
     Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income. Should our operating strategies fail to produce sufficient taxable income in the future, we would need to record a valuation allowance in the appropriate future reporting period as required by generally accepted accounting principles. Norstan's U.S. net operating loss carryforwards expire from 2020 to 2021, and the Canadian net operating loss carryforwards expire through fiscal 2011.
     For the six month period ended October 30, 2004, we recorded a tax provision of 38.0% on our income from continuing operations and on the gain on disposal of discontinued operations. In the similar period last year, we recorded a tax benefit of 39.0% on the loss from continuing operations and a 39.0% provision on the gain on disposal of discontinued operations. These effective rates represent our federal statutory rate adjusted for state income taxes and other permanent tax items.
 
NOTE 5 - STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION:
     We apply Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" and related interpretations in accounting for our stock-based compensation plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized in the accompanying statements of operations. Had compensation cost been recognized based on the fair values of options at the grant dates consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", as amended by SFAS No. 148, our net income (loss) (in thousands) and net income (loss) per common share would have changed to the following pro forma amounts:
NOTE 6  DEBT OBLIGATIONS:
     In December 2003, we entered into a five year $27.5 million secured credit agreement with Wells Fargo Foothill, Inc. consisting of the following components: A) a $5.0 million revolving line of credit, and B) a $22.5 million term loan payable in 30 monthly installments of $333,333 beginning on February 1, 2004, with the remaining $12.5 million principal due and payable upon maturity at December 9, 2008. Availability under the revolving line of credit is generally based on a percentage of eligible recurring service and maintenance revenues, as defined. This credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets.
     The $5.0 million revolving credit facility currently bears interest at the bank's reference rate plus 2.0% or LIBOR plus 4.0% with provisions for future rate reductions based on certain of our financial ratios. The term loan bears interest at the bank's reference rate plus 3.5%. Annual unused line fees on the revolver are 0.5% and other monthly and annual fees are due to the lender throughout the duration of the agreement. In addition, we are required to meet certain financial and other covenants, including maintaining $2.0 million in excess availability. The agreement, as amended, requires us to maintain, on a quarterly basis, minimum levels of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), certain levels of Norstan Resale Services Group revenues, and limits our capital expenditures on an annual basis. As of October 30, 2004, borrowings under this agreement were $18.3 million with an average interest rate of 8.25%. We were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants as of October 30, 2004.
     Proceeds from the term note were used to repay and terminate our previous credit agreement. As a result of the termination of our previous credit agreement, we wrote-off the remaining $162,000 in unamortized debt financing costs during the third quarter of fiscal 2004. In connection with our new secured credit agreement, we capitalized approximately $575,000 in debt financing costs which are being amortized over the term of the new agreement.
     During the periods presented in this quarterly report prior to December 10, 2003, Norstan operated under a previous credit agreement with certain banks, as amended from time to time, consisting of a revolving line of credit and term loan, each secured by substantially all the assets of
 
Norstan. The previous credit agreement provided for interest at various rates ranging from the banks' reference rate plus 0.5% to the reference rate plus 2.0%, or the Eurodollar rate advance plus 2.5% to the Eurodollar rate advance plus 4.0%, plus annual commitment fees ranging from 0.375% to 0.25%.
     We believe that a combination of cash expected to be generated from operations and borrowing capacity available under our current financing arrangements will be adequate to fund anticipated operating activities, capital expenditures and debt repayments through at least April 30, 2005. However, there is no assurance that the assumptions used by management in formulating this assessment will prove accurate or that additional financing, if needed, will be available in the future on acceptable terms.
NOTE 7 - RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES:
     During the second quarter of fiscal 2004, we recorded restructuring and other charges of $4.2 million, consisting of a restructuring charge of $3.7 million and a write-off of certain fixed assets of approximately $500,000. These charges were primarily within our Communications Solutions and Services segment and relate to actions completed by the end of our second fiscal quarter. The restructuring charge of $3.7 million related to a workforce reduction of 150 people (all of whom have been terminated) as we continued to right-size our organization and bring our expense structure in-line with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for our solutions and services. This charge consisted of $3.3 million in severance costs and other related employment benefits, together with $400,000 in lease termination and other facility costs. In addition, we recorded a charge of approximately $500,000 for the write-off of certain assets. These assets consisted primarily of non-recoverable capitalized system applications costs and other hardware costs.
     During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we recorded additional restructuring and other charges of $9.4 million. Approximately $7.2 million of this amount was for our reorganization efforts announced in February 2004. Included in these efforts was a reorganization of our Communications Solutions and Services segment to better focus our efforts and to streamline sales and services to improve profitability. Solutions and Services now concentrates customer acquisition and retention efforts into two geographically focused business units. In addition, our sales support and service functions have been realigned to better serve our solutions and services team and our customers' needs. This restructuring charge includes $2.4 million in costs associated with employee and severance costs related to a workforce reduction of 100 people (all of whom have been terminated as of October 30, 2004), $3.9 million related to facilities exit and other contractual costs, and $831,000 in other asset impairment charges. The remaining $2.2 million charge relates to a claim made by the Universal Services Administrative Company (USAC) regarding a specific E-rate project completed by Norstan. The USAC is seeking a recovery of amounts dispursed by the USAC to Norstan on behalf of one of our customers. We are appealing this claim. However, as we may be required to repay a portion or all of the disputed funding, we have established the requisite reserve (see Note 8).
     As of October 30, 2004, there remained restructuring and other reserves of approximately $6.7 million in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet; $5.0 million included in other accrued current liabilities and $1.7 million in other long-term liabilities. We anticipate the majority of the remaining employee severance costs will be paid by the end of fiscal 2005. Payment of certain facility costs will extend through fiscal 2012.
 
     The following table summarizes the remaining reserves reflected in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet (in thousands):
NOTE 8  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:
Legal Proceedings:
     In April 2004, we received a Commitment Adjustment Letter from the Universal Services Administrative Company (USAC), which oversees the Federal Communications Commission's School and Libraries Program of the Universal Service Fund, also called the "E-rate program." Funding commitments under the E-rate program provide for discounts on eligible services such as telecommunications services, internet access, network equipment and wiring of instructional buildings and classrooms to connect to the Internet. The letter informed Norstan that USAC had undertaken an audit of the Navajo Preparatory School (Navajo Prep) project for funding year 2001, in which we had installed specific equipment and services for which we received approximately $2.2 million. The audit report concluded that Navajo Prep had not complied with key requirements of the E-rate program and, consistent with E-rate policies, USAC is seeking recovery of the full amount disbursed to Norstan on behalf of Navajo Prep. In June 2004, we filed an appeal with USAC and began an investigation of the Navajo Prep project. A reserve of $2.2 million was established in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. As a result of the investigation, Norstan has decided not to pursue the appeal. In addition, on its own initiative, Norstan will review all of its other E-rate projects for compliance with E-rate program requirements. Norstan received a total of approximately $5.5 million for such other E-rate projects.
     In February 2002, we were awarded $7.2 million resulting from a claim before the American Arbitration Association against the former owner of PRIMA Consulting (PRIMA) which claims arose out of our September 1997 acquisition of PRIMA. Subsequently, we reached a settlement with the former owner, Mr. Michael Vadini. The settlement provided that Norstan receive $3.0 million in cash, a promissory note issued by Mr. Vadini for $1.0 million to be paid in monthly installments beginning in June 2002, and certain real properties. As a result of the settlement, we recorded a $3.0 million pre-tax gain in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, based on the amount of cash received. We recorded a full reserve against the real property and the promissory note and planned to record any future gains on the sale of the real properties and collection of the promissory note as amounts are assured of realization. In December 2002, after receiving the first six $83,333 monthly installment payments, we agreed to accept a lump sum payment of $470,000 in settlement of the remaining monthly installments which totaled approximately $500,000 at that time. We recorded a gain, net of tax, of approximately $591,000 through discontinued operations relating to payments received on the promissory note during fiscal 2003. In May 2003, one of the real properties was sold and a pre-tax gain of approximately $253,000 was recorded through discontinued operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. In addition, in January 2004, a second real property was sold and a pre-tax gain of approximately $341,000 was recorded through discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. As of October 30, 2004, we retained title to one remaining property.
     We are involved in other legal actions in the ordinary course of our business. Although the outcome of any such legal actions cannot be predicted, in the opinion of management there are no other legal proceedings pending against or involving Norstan for which the outcome is likely to have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results or financial condition.
 
Vendor Agreements:
     Norstan has been a distributor of Siemens equipment since 1976 and is currently Siemens' largest distributor in North America. The term of the distribution agreement signed in January 1999, was for five years and has been extended one year, currently through January 2005. Our relationship with Siemens is integral to our business. Any significant disruption of this distribution relationship could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
     In addition to Norstan's distribution of new Siemens equipment pursuant to the distribution agreement, Norstan and Siemens have been parties in a used equipment alliance in which we managed the acquisition, marketing, refurbishment and resale of Siemens certified used telephony equipment, becoming the largest supplier of Siemens and ROLM refurbished equipment. On July 22, 2004, Siemens Information and Communication Networks, Inc., elected to end their resale alliance with us in the used equipment business effective at the expiration of the current agreement, July 31, 2004. Effective August 1, 2004, we continued to offer customers refurbished Siemens telephony equipment. Norstan Resale Services Group now competes directly with Siemens in procurement as well as the sale of refurbished equipment to end users. In addition, we offer new and used audio and video conferencing systems, wireless solutions, call center accessories, components, desktop products, and services through our Norstan Resale Services Group.
     The termination of this resale alliance does not affect our ongoing distribution agreement with Siemens with respect to new equipment.
     In addition, we maintain relationships with a wide range of leading technology companies including Aspect Communications, Applied Voice and Speech Technologies (AVST), Cisco Systems, Ericsson, Intervoice, Nortel Networks, ScanSoft, SpectraLink, Verint, and Witness Systems.
NOTE 9 - BUSINESS SEGMENTS:
     We deliver our products and services through two business segments, Communications Solutions and Services and Resale Services. Interim disclosures under the requirements of SFAS No. 131, "Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information," were as follows (in thousands):

 
Exhibit 99.3
     The following unaudited combined pro forma financial statements are based upon the historical consolidated financial statements of Black Box Corporation ("Black Box") and Norstan, Inc. ("Norstan") and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto. Norstan's historical consolidated financial statements are included elsewhere in this filing. The fiscal period end dates are those of Black Box. Certain reclassifications have been made to the historical presentation of Norstan's financial statements to conform to the presentation used in the unaudited combined pro forma financial statements.
     The Unaudited Combined Pro Forma Statement of Income for the year ended March 31, 2004 combines information from the audited historical Consolidated Statements of Income of Black Box and Norstan for the twelve months ended March 31, 2004 and April 30, 2004, respectively. The Unaudited Combined Pro Forma Statement of Income for the six months ended October 2, 2004 combines information from the unaudited historical Consolidated Statements of Income of Black Box and Norstan for the six months ended October 2, 2004 and October 30, 2004, respectively. The Unaudited Combined Pro Forma Statements of Income assume the transaction closed on April 1, 2003.
     The Unaudited Combined Pro Forma Balance Sheet combines information from the unaudited historical Consolidated Balance Sheets of Black Box and Norstan as of October 2, 2004 and October 30, 2004, respectively. The balance sheet pro forma adjustments are presented as if the transaction closed on October 2, 2004.
     The unaudited combined pro forma financial statements were prepared using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations." The pro forma adjustments are described in the accompanying notes and give effect to events that are (a) directly attributable to the acquisition, (b) factually supported and (c) with respect to the statements of income, expected to have a continuing impact.
     The allocation of the purchase price is based upon preliminary estimates of the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition. Management, with the assistance of independent valuation specialists, is currently assessing the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This preliminary allocation of the purchase price is dependent upon certain estimates and assumptions, which are preliminary and have been made solely for the purpose of developing such unaudited pro forma financial statements. As a final determination of the required purchase accounting adjustments has not yet been made, the financial position and results of operations will vary, perhaps significantly, from the pro forma amounts reflected herein.
     As of the date of this filing, management, with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, using valuation techniques and assumptions, was able to preliminarily estimate the fair value assignable to several identified definite-lived intangibles; however, no additional allocation of purchase price in excess of cost was made for the remaining identified definite-lived intangible. The valuation of this intangible is currently being assessed; however, it is too early in the process to make reasonable estimates and assumptions. A discussion indicating possible conclusions on the allocation and their impacts to the pro forma earnings are included in the pro forma footnotes.
 
     In conjunction with the acquisition, management assessed operating synergies as they relate to facilities, operations and other assets of the business and developed a strategic restructuring plan. The unaudited combined pro forma financial statements include the estimated liabilities from these restructuring plans. The effects of cost synergies and one-time nonrecurring transactions associated with the acquisition are not reflected in the Unaudited Combined Pro Forma Statements of Income.
     The unaudited combined pro forma financial statements presented are for information purposes only and do not purport to represent what Black Box's financial position or results of operations as of the dates or for the periods presented would have been had the acquisition occurred on such date or at the beginning of the periods indicated, or to project Black Box's financial position or results of operations for any future date or period.

Note 1: Estimated Purchase Price
     These unaudited combined pro forma financial statements reflect a preliminary allocation of the purchase price as if the transaction had been completed on April 1, 2003 with respect to the Unaudited Combined Pro Forma Statements of Income, and as of October 2, 2004 with respect to the Unaudited Combined Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet. The preliminary allocations are subject to change based on finalization of the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The estimated purchase price of $107,244 has been calculated and preliminarily assigned to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired as follows:
Purchase Price Calculation:
     The preliminary allocation of the estimated purchase price based on the estimated fair values of Norstan's assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition are as follows:
Purchase price allocation to net tangible and intangible assets acquired and to goodwill:
Note 2: Pro Forma Financial Statement Adjustments
 
estimated interest rate would decrease the twelve months ended March 31, 2004 after-tax pro forma earnings by approximately $60 or $0.01 per diluted share and the six months ended October 2, 2004 by approximately $30 or a de minimis impact on earnings per diluted share. A reconciliation of the calculation of the pro forma adjustment to interest expense is presented below:
 
Based on the above scenario, Black Box's pro forma after-tax earnings would decrease by approximately $922, or $0.05 per diluted share, and $460, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the twelve and six months ended March 31, 2004 and October 2, 2004, respectively. This scenario excludes the effect of the non-compete and backlog intangibles, as the earnings impact is included in the Unaudited Combined Pro Forma Statements of Income presented herein.
 
Based on the above scenario, Black Box's pro forma after-tax earnings would decrease by approximately $968, or $0.05 per diluted share, and $484, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the twelve and six months ended March 31, 2004 and October 2, 2004, respectively. This scenario excludes the effect of the non-compete and backlog intangibles, as the earnings impact is included in the Unaudited Combined Pro Forma Statements of Income presented herein.

The amended Plan document is set forth in Exhibit 10.1 filed herewith.

Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
     (c) Exhibits. The following exhibit is being filed in accordance with Item 601 of Regulation S-K:
Table of Contents
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
Exhibit 10.1
          
I. PURPOSES
          BLACK BOX CORPORATION (the "Company") desires to afford certain of its key employees and the key employees of any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company now existing or hereafter formed or acquired who are responsible for the continued growth of the Company an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company, and thus to create in such key employees an increased interest in and a greater concern for the welfare of the Company and its subsidiaries.
          The Company, by means of this 1992 Stock Option Plan as originally approved on November 11, 1992, and as further amended on May 10, 1994, August 9, 1994, August 7, 1995, August 12, 1996, August 13, 1997, February 3, 1998, August 10, 1998, August 10, 1999, August 8, 2000, August 23, 2001, August 15, 2002, August 12, 2003, August 10, 2004, March 15, 2005 and May 4, 2005 (the "Plan"), seeks to retain the services of persons now holding key positions and to secure the services of persons capable of filling such positions.
          The stock options ("Options") and stock appreciation rights ("Rights") offered pursuant to the Plan are a matter of separate inducement and are not in lieu of any salary or other compensation for the services of any key employee.
          The Options granted under the Plan are intended to be either incentive stock options ("Incentive Options") within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or options that do not meet the requirements for Incentive Options ("Non-Qualified Options"), but the Company makes no warranty as to the qualification of any Option as an Incentive Option.
          
II. AMOUNT OF STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN; PER PERSON LIMITATION
          The total number of shares of common stock of the Company which may be purchased or acquired pursuant to the exercise of Options or Rights granted under the Plan shall not exceed, in the aggregate, 8,600,000 shares of the authorized common stock, $.001 par value per share, of the Company (the "Shares"), such number subject to adjustment as provided in Article XII hereof. Shares that are the subject of Rights and related Options shall be counted only once in determining whether the maximum number of Shares that may be purchased or awarded under the Plan has been exceeded. No person may receive Options or Rights under the Plan for more than 500,000 Shares in any given fiscal year.
          Shares acquired under the Plan may be either authorized but unissued Shares or Shares of issued stock held in the Company's treasury, or both, at the discretion of the Company. If and to the extent that Options or Rights granted under the Plan expire or terminate without having been exercised, the Shares covered by such expired or terminated Options or Rights shall again become available for award under the Plan.
 
          Except as provided in Article XIX and subject to Article II, the Company may, from time to time during the period beginning on the date on which the Company consummates an underwritten initial public offering of Shares (the "Effective Date") and originally ending on November 30, 2002 but amended to end on November 30, 2012 (the "Termination Date"), grant to certain key employees of the Company, or of any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company now existing or hereafter formed or acquired, Incentive Options and/or Non-Qualified Options and/or Rights under the terms hereinafter set forth.
          Provisions of the Plan that pertain to Options or Rights granted to an employee shall apply to Options, Rights or a combination thereof.
          As used in the Plan, the term "subsidiary corporation" and "parent corporation" shall mean, respectively, a corporation coming within the definition of such terms contained in Sections 424(f) and 424(e) of the Code.
          
III. ADMINISTRATION
          The board of directors of the Company (the "Board of Directors") shall designate from among its members an option committee, which may be the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee"), to administer the Plan. The Committee shall consist of no fewer than two members of the Board of Directors, each of whom shall be a "disinterested person" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 (or any successor rule or regulation) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). A majority of the members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum, and the act of a majority of the members of the Committee shall be the act of the Committee. Any member of the Committee may be removed at any time either with or without cause by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors, and any vacancy on the Committee at any time may be filled by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors.
          Subject to the express provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have authority, in its discretion, to determine the employees to whom Options or Rights shall be granted, the time when such Options or Rights shall be granted, the number of Shares which shall be subject to each Option or Right, the purchase price or exercise price of each Option or Right, the period(s) during which such Options or Rights shall become exercisable (whether in whole or in part) and the other terms and provisions thereof (which need not be identical).
          Subject to the express provisions of the Plan, the Committee also shall have authority to construe the Plan and the Options and Rights granted thereunder, to amend the Plan and the Options and Rights granted thereunder, to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, to determine the terms and provisions of the Options (which need not be identical) and Rights (which need not be identical) granted thereunder and to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for administering the Plan. The Committee also shall have the authority to require, in its discretion, as a condition of the granting of any such Option or Right, that the employee agree (i) not to sell or otherwise dispose of Shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of such Option or Right for a period of six (6) months following the date of the acquisition of such Option or Right and (ii) that in the event of termination of employment of such employee, other than as a result of dismissal without cause, such employee will not, for a
 
period to be fixed at the time of the grant of the Option or Right, enter into any other employment or participate directly or indirectly in any other business or enterprise which is competitive with the business of the Company or any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company, or enter into any employment in which such employee will be called upon to utilize special knowledge obtained through employment with the Company or any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation thereof. In no event will an employee who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act be entitled to sell or otherwise dispose of any Shares acquired pursuant to exercise of any such Options or Rights for a period of six (6) months from the date of the acquisition of such Options or Rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall not have the authority to reprice any outstanding Option or Right without stockholder approval.
          The determination of the Committee on matters referred to in this Article III shall be conclusive.
          The Committee may employ such legal counsel, consultants and agents as it may deem desirable for the administration of the Plan and may rely upon any opinion or computation received from any such legal counsel, consultant or agent. Expenses incurred by the Committee in the engagement of such counsel, consultant or agent shall be paid by the Company. No member or former member of the Committee shall be liable for any action or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any award of Options or Rights granted hereunder.
          
IV. ELIGIBILITY
          Options and Rights may be granted only to key employees of the Company or of any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company, except as hereinafter provided, and shall not be granted to any officer or director who is not also a key employee or to any member of the Committee. Any person who shall have retired from active employment by the Company or a subsidiary corporation or parent corporation thereof, although such person shall have entered into a consulting contract with the Company or a subsidiary corporation or parent corporation thereof, shall not be eligible to receive an Option or a Right.
          The Plan does not create a right in any employee to participate in the Plan, nor does it create a right in any employee to have any Options or Rights granted to him or her.
          
V. OPTION PRICE AND PAYMENT
          The price for each Share purchasable under any Option granted hereunder shall be such amount as the Committee shall, in its best judgment, determine to be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value per Share at the date the Option is granted; , , that in the case of an Incentive Option granted to a person who, at the time such Option is granted, owns shares of the Company or any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company which possesses more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of shares of the Company or of any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company, the purchase price for each Share shall be such amount as the Committee in its best judgment shall determine to be not less than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the fair market value per Share at the date the Option is granted. In determining stock ownership of an employee for any purposes under the Plan, the rules of Section 424(d) of the Code shall be
provided
however
 
applied, and the Committee may rely on representations of fact made to it by the employee and believed by it to be true.
          If the Shares are listed on a national securities exchange in the United States (which, for purposes of this Article V, shall be deemed to include any last sale reported over-the-counter market), on any date on which the fair market value per Share is to be determined, the fair market value per Share shall be deemed to be the average of the high and low quotations at which such Shares are sold on such national securities exchange on the date such Option is granted. If the Shares are listed on a national securities exchange in the United States on such date, but the Shares are not traded on such date, or such national securities exchange is not open for business on such date, the fair market value per Share shall be determined as of the closest preceding date on which such exchange shall have been open for business and the Shares shall have been traded. If the Shares are listed on more than one national securities exchange in the United States on the date on which the fair market value per Share is to be determined, the Committee shall determine which national securities exchange shall be used for the purpose of determining the fair market value per Share.
          If a public market exists for the Shares on any date on which the fair market value per Share is to be determined but the Shares are not listed on a national securities exchange in the United States, the fair market value per Share shall be deemed to be the mean between the closing bid and asked quotations in the over-the-counter market for the Shares on such date. If there are no bid and asked quotations for the Shares on such date, the fair market value per Share shall be deemed to be the mean between the closing bid and asked quotations in the over-the-counter market for the Shares on the closest date preceding such date for which such quotations are available.
          If no public market exists for the Shares on any date on which the fair market value per Share is to be determined, the Committee shall, in its sole discretion and best judgment, determine the fair market value of a Share.
          For purposes of this Plan, the determination by the Committee of the fair market value of a Share shall be conclusive.
          Upon the exercise of an Option granted hereunder, the Company shall cause the purchased Shares to be issued only when it shall have received the full purchase price for the Shares in cash or by certified check; , , that in lieu of cash, the holder of an Option may, if and to the extent the terms of such Option so provide and to the extent permitted by applicable law, exercise an Option (i) in whole or in part, by delivering to the Company shares of common stock of the Company (in proper form for transfer and accompanied by all requisite stock transfer tax stamps or cash in lieu thereof) owned by such holder having a fair market value equal to the exercise price applicable to that portion of the Option being exercised by the delivery of such Shares or (ii) in part, by delivering to the Company an executed promissory note on such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine, at the time of grant, in its sole discretion; , , that the principal amount of such note shall not exceed eighty percent (80%) (or such lesser percentage as would be permitted by applicable margin regulations) of the aggregate purchase price of the Shares then being purchased pursuant to the exercise of such Option. The fair market value of the stock so delivered shall be
provided
however
provided
however
 
determined as of the date immediately preceding the date on which the Option is exercised, or as may be required in order to comply with or to conform to the requirements of any applicable laws or regulations.
          
VI. USE OF PROCEEDS
          The cash proceeds of the sale of Shares pursuant to the Plan are to be added to the general funds of the Company and used for its general corporate purposes as the Board of Directors shall determine.
          
VII. TERM OF OPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE RIGHT OF EXERCISE
          Any Option shall be exercisable at such times, in such amounts and during such period or periods as the Committee shall determine at the date of the grant of such Option; , , that an Incentive Option shall not be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date such Option is granted; and that, in the case of an Incentive Option granted to a person who, at the time such Option is granted, owns stock of the Company or any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company possessing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or of any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company, such Option shall not be exercisable after the expiration of five (5) years from the date such Option is granted.
provided
however
provided
further
          Except to the extent otherwise provided under the Code, to the extent that the aggregate fair market value of stock for which Incentive Options are exercisable for the first time by an employee during any calendar year (under all stock option plans of the Company and of any parent corporation or subsidiary corporation of the Company) exceeds one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), such Options shall be treated as Non-Qualified Options. For purposes of this limitation, (i) the fair market value of stock is determined as of the time the Option is granted, and (ii) the limitation will be applied by taking into account Options in the order in which they were granted.
          Subject to the provisions of Article XVIII, the Committee shall have the right to accelerate, in whole or in part, from time to time, conditionally or unconditionally, rights to exercise any Option granted hereunder.
          To the extent that an Option is not exercised within the period of exercisability specified therein, it shall expire as to the then unexercised part.
          In no event shall an Option granted hereunder be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
          
VIII. EXERCISE OF OPTIONS
          Options granted under the Plan shall be exercised by the optionee as to all or part of the Shares covered thereby by the giving of written notice of the exercise thereof to the Corporate Secretary of the Company at the principal business office of the Company, specifying the number of Shares to be purchased and specifying a business day not more than fifteen (15) days from the date such notice is given for the payment of the purchase price against delivery of the Shares being purchased. Subject to the terms of Articles XIV, XVI, and XVII, the Company
 
shall cause certificates for the Shares so purchased to be delivered to the optionee at the principal business office of the Company, against payment of the full purchase price, on the date specified in the notice of exercise.
          
IX. STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
          In the discretion of the Committee, a Right may be granted (i) alone, (ii) simultaneously with the grant of an Option (either Incentive or Non-Qualified) and in conjunction therewith or in the alternative thereto or (iii) subsequent to the grant of a Non-Qualified Option and in conjunction therewith or in the alternative thereto.
          The exercise price of a Right granted alone shall be determined by the Committee but shall not be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value of one Share on the date of grant of such Right. A Right granted simultaneously with or subsequent to the grant of an Option and in conjunction therewith or in the alternative thereto shall have the same exercise price as the related Option, shall be transferable only upon the same terms and conditions as the related Option, and shall be exercisable only to the same extent as the related Option; , , that a Right, by its terms, shall be exercisable only when the fair market value of the Shares subject to the Right and related Option exceeds the exercise price thereof.
provided
however
          Upon exercise of a Right granted simultaneously with or subsequent to an Option and in the alternative thereto, the number of Shares for which the related Option shall be exercisable shall be reduced by the number of Shares for which the Right shall have been exercised. The number of Shares for which a Right shall be exercisable shall be reduced upon any exercise of a related Option by the number of Shares for which such Option shall have been exercised.
          Any Right shall be exercisable upon such additional terms and conditions as may from time to time be prescribed by the Committee.
          A Right shall entitle the holder upon exercise thereof to receive from the Company, upon a written request filed with the Corporate Secretary of the Company at its principal offices (the "Request"), a number of Shares (with or without restrictions as to substantial risk of forfeiture and transferability, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion), an amount of cash, or any combination of Shares and cash, as specified in the Request (but subject to the approval of the Committee in its sole discretion, at any time up to and including the time of payment, as to the making of any cash payment), having an aggregate fair market value equal to the product of (i) the excess of the fair market value, on the day of such Request, of one Share over the exercise price per Share specified in such Right or its related Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of Shares for which such Right shall be exercised.
          Any election by a holder of a Right to receive cash in full or partial settlement of such Right, and any exercise of such Right for cash, may be made only by a Request filed with the Corporate Secretary of the Company during the period beginning on the third business day following the date of release for publication by the Company of quarterly or annual summary statements of sales and earnings and ending on the twelfth business day following such date. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt by the Company of a Request to receive cash in full or partial settlement of a Right or to exercise such Right for cash, the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, either consent to or disapprove, in whole or in part, such Request. A Request to
 
receive cash in full or partial settlement of a Right or to exercise a Right for cash may provide that, in the event the Committee shall disapprove such Request, such Request shall be deemed to be an exercise of such Right for Shares.
          If the Committee disapproves in whole or in part any election by a holder to receive cash in full or partial settlement of a Right or to exercise such Right for cash, such disapproval shall not affect such holder's right to exercise such Right at a later date, to the extent that such Right shall be otherwise exercisable, or to elect the form of payment at a later date, provided that an election to receive cash upon such later exercise shall be subject to the approval of the Committee. Additionally, such disapproval shall not affect such holder's right to exercise any related Option or Options granted to such holder under the Plan.
          A holder of a Right shall not be entitled to request or receive cash in full or partial payment of such Right unless such Right shall have been held for six (6) months from the date of acquisition to the date of cash settlement thereof; , , that such prohibition shall not apply if the holder of such Right is not subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. In no event will a holder of a Right who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act be entitled to make such a request or receive cash in full or partial payment of such Right until the Company shall have satisfied the informational requirements of Rule 16b-3(e)(1) promulgated under the Exchange Act for the specified one year period.
provided
however
          A Right shall be deemed exercised on the last day of its term, if not otherwise exercised by the holder thereof, provided that the fair market value of the Shares subject to the Right exceeds the exercise price thereof on such date.
          For all purposes of this Article IX, the fair market value of Shares shall be determined in accordance with the principles set forth in the Article V.
          
X. NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
          Neither an Option nor a Right granted hereunder shall be transferable, whether by operation of law or otherwise, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and any Option or Right granted hereunder shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the holder only by such holder. Except to the extent provided above, Options and Rights may not be assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or disposed of in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) and shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process.
          
XI. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT
          Upon termination of employment of any employee with the Company and all subsidiary corporations and parent corporations of the Company, an Option or Right previously granted to the employee, unless otherwise specified by the Committee in the Option or Right, shall, to the extent not theretofore exercised, terminate and become null and void, provided that:
     (a) if the employee shall die while in the employ of such corporation or during either the three (3) month or one (1) year period, whichever is applicable, specified in
 
clause (b) below and at a time when such employee was entitled to exercise an Option or Right as herein provided, the legal representative of such employee, or such person who acquired such Option or Right by bequest or inheritance or by reason of the death of the employee, may, not later than one (1) year from the date of death, exercise such Option or Right, to the extent not theretofore exercised, in respect of any or all of such number of Shares as specified by the Committee in such Option or Right; and
     (b) if the employment of an employee to whom such Option or Right shall have been granted shall terminate by reason of the employee's retirement (at such age or upon such conditions as shall be specified by the Board of Directors), disability (as described in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code) or dismissal by the employer other than for cause (as defined below), and while such employee is entitled to exercise such Option or Right as herein provided, such employee shall have the right to exercise such Option or Right so granted, to the extent not theretofore exercised, in respect of any or all of such number of Shares as specified by the Committee in such Option or Right, at any time up to and including (i) three (3) months after the date of such termination of employment in the case of termination by reason of retirement or dismissal other than for cause and (ii) one (1) year after the date of termination of employment in the case of termination by reason of disability.
          If an employee voluntarily terminates his or her employment, or is discharged for cause, any Option or Right granted hereunder shall, unless otherwise specified by the Committee in the Option or Right, forthwith terminate with respect to any unexercised portion thereof.
          If an Option or Right granted hereunder shall be exercised by the legal representative of a deceased or disabled employee or former employee, or by a person who acquired an Option or Right granted hereunder by bequest or inheritance or by reason of death of any employee or former employee, written notice of such exercise shall be accompanied by a certified copy of letters testamentary or equivalent proof of the right of such legal representative or other person to exercise such Option or Right.
          For the purposes of the Plan, the term "for cause" shall mean (i) with respect to an employee who is party to a written agreement with, or, alternatively, participates in a compensation or benefit plan of the Company or a subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company, which agreement or plan contains a definition of "for cause" or "cause" (or words of like import) for purposes of termination of employment thereunder by the Company or such subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company, "for cause" or "cause" as defined in the most recent of such agreements or plans, or (ii) in all other cases, (a) the willful commission by an employee of a criminal or other act that causes substantial economic damage to the Company or a subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company or substantial injury to the business reputation of the Company or a subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company; (b) the commission by an employee of an act of fraud in the performance of such employee's duties on behalf of the Company or a subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company; or (c) the continuing willful failure of an employee to perform the duties of such employee to the Company or a subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company (other than such failure resulting from the employee's incapacity due to physical or mental illness) after written notice thereof (specifying the particulars thereof in
 
reasonable detail) and a reasonable opportunity to be heard and cure such failure are given to the employee by the Board of Directors or the Committee. For purposes of the Plan, no act, or failure to act, on the employee's part shall be considered "willful" unless done or omitted to be done by the employee not in good faith and without reasonable belief that the employee's action or omission was in the best interest of the Company or a subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company.
          For the purposes of the Plan, an employment relationship shall be deemed to exist between an individual and a corporation if, at the time of the determination, the individual was an "employee" of such corporation for purposes of Section 422(a) of the Code. If an individual is on military, sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence, such individual shall be considered an "employee" for purposes of the exercise of an Option or Right and shall be entitled to exercise such Option or Right during such leave if the period of such leave does not exceed ninety (90) days, or, if longer, so long as the individual's right to reemployment with the corporation granting the option (or a related corporation) is guaranteed either by statute or by contract. If the period of leave exceeds ninety (90) days, the employment relationship shall be deemed to have terminated on the ninety-first (91st) day of such leave, unless the individual's right to reemployment is guaranteed by statute or contract.
          A termination of employment shall not be deemed to occur by reason of (i) the transfer of an employee from employment by the Company to employment by a subsidiary corporation or a parent corporation of the Company or (ii) the transfer of an employee from employment by a subsidiary corporation or a parent corporation of the Company to employment by the Company or by another subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of the Company. Furthermore, solely for purposes of determining the rights and obligations under any outstanding Options or Rights theretofore granted, in the event that the Company ceases to own, directly or indirectly, stock possessing fifty percent (50%) or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of a subsidiary company by virtue of a recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, split-up, spin-off, combination of shares or other like change in capital structure of the Company, the Committee may determine that employment by such former subsidiary (or any parent or subsidiary company of such subsidiary) shall continue to be deemed to be employment by the Company for purposes of the Plan.
          In the event of the complete liquidation or dissolution of a subsidiary corporation, or in the event that the Company ceases to own, directly or indirectly, stock possessing fifty percent (50%) or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of such corporation, any unexercised Options or Rights theretofore granted to any person employed by such subsidiary corporation will be deemed canceled unless such person is employed by the Company or by any parent corporation or another subsidiary corporation after the occurrence of such event. In the event an Option or Right is to be canceled pursuant to the provisions of the previous sentence, notice of such cancellation will be given to each employee holding unexercised Options or Rights and such holder will have the right to exercise such Options or Rights in full (without regard to any limitation set forth or imposed pursuant to Article VII) during the thirty (30) day period following notice of such cancellation.
 
          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article XI, in no event, however, shall any person be entitled to exercise any Option or Right after the expiration of the period of exercisability of such Option or Right as specified therein.
          
XII. ADJUSTMENT OF SHARES; EFFECT OF CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS
          In the event of any change in the outstanding Shares through merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, split-up, split-off, spin-off, combination of shares, exchange of shares, issuance of rights to subscribe for Shares, or other like change in capital structure of the Company, the Committee shall make such adjustment to each outstanding Option and Right that it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate. The term "Shares" after any such change shall refer to the securities, cash and/or property then receivable upon exercise of an Option or Right. In addition, in the event of any such change, the Committee shall make any further adjustments as may be appropriate to the maximum number of Shares which may be acquired under the Plan pursuant to the exercise of Options and Rights, the maximum number of Shares which may be so acquired by one employee and the number of Shares and prices per Share subject to outstanding Options and Rights as shall be equitable to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights under such Options or Rights, and the determination of the Committee as to these matters shall be conclusive. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) each such adjustment with respect to an Incentive Option and any related Right shall comply with the rules of Section 424(a) of the Code and (ii) in no event shall any adjustment be made which would render any Incentive Option granted hereunder to be other than an "incentive stock option" for purposes of Section 422 of the Code.
          In the event of a "change in control" of the Company, all then outstanding Options and Rights shall immediately become exercisable. For purposes of the Plan, a "change in control" of the Company occurs if: (a) any "Person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act), other than Odyssey Partners, L.P. and its affiliates (which, for purposes of this Article XII only, is deemed to include E.R. Yost) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly of securities of the Company representing (i) fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then-outstanding securities; or (ii) twenty-five percent (25%) or more but less than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the Company's then-outstanding securities if such transaction(s) giving rise to such beneficial ownership are not approved by the Company's Board of Directors; or (b) at any time a majority of the members of the Board of Directors has been elected or designated by any Person, other than Odyssey Partners, L.P. and its affiliates (which, for purposes of this Article XII only, is deemed to include E.R. Yost); or (c) the Board of Directors shall approve a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or any merger, consolidation, issuance of securities or purchase of assets, in all cases other than to or with Odyssey Partners, L.P. or its affiliates (which, for purposes of this Article XII only, is deemed to include E.R. Yost), the result of which would be the occurrence of any event described in clause (a) or (b) above.
          The Committee, in its discretion, may determine that, upon the occurrence of a transaction described in the preceding paragraph, each Option or Right outstanding hereunder shall terminate within a specified number of days after notice to the holder, and such holder shall receive, with respect to each Share subject to such Option or Right, cash in an amount equal to
 
the excess of the fair market value of such Shares immediately prior to the occurrence of such transaction over the exercise price per Share of such Option or Right. The provisions contained in the preceding sentence shall be inapplicable to an Option or Right granted within six (6) months before the occurrence of a transaction described above if the holder of such Option or Right is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.
          
XIII. RIGHT TO TERMINATE EMPLOYMENT
          The Plan shall not impose any obligation on the Company or on any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation thereof to continue the employment of any holder of Options or Rights and it shall not impose any obligation on the part of any holder of Options or Rights to remain in the employ of the Company or of any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation thereof.
          
XIV. PURCHASE FOR INVESTMENT
          Except for hereinafter provided, the Committee may require an employee, as a condition upon exercise of any Option or Right granted hereunder, to execute and deliver to the Company (a) stock powers with respect to Shares underlying a particular Option or Right and required to be held by a custodian, and (b) a written statement, in form satisfactory to the Committee in which the employee represents and warrants that Shares are being acquired for such person's own account for investment only and not with a view to the resale or distribution thereof. The employee shall, at the request of the Committee, be required to represent and warrant in writing that any subsequent resale or distribution of Shares by the Employee shall be made only pursuant to either (i) a Registration Statement on an appropriate form under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), which Registration Statement has become effective and is current with regard to the Shares being sold, or (ii) a specific exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, but in claiming such exemption the employee shall, prior to any offer of sale or sale of such Shares, obtain a prior favorable written opinion of counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to counsel for the Company, as to the application of such exemption thereto. The foregoing restriction shall not apply to (i) issuances by the Company so long as the Shares being issued are registered under the Securities Act and a prospectus in respect thereof is current or (ii) re-offerings of Shares by affiliates of the Company (as defined in Rule 405 or any successor rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act) if the Shares being re-offered are registered under the Securities Act and a prospectus in respect thereof is current.
          
XV. ISSUE OF CERTIFICATES, LEGENDS, PAYMENT OF EXPENSES
          Upon any exercise of an Option or Right which may be granted hereunder and, in the case of an Option, payment of the purchase price, a certificate or certificates for the Shares shall be issued by the Company in the name of the person exercising the Option or Right and shall be delivered to or upon the order of such person.
          The Company may endorse such legend or legends upon the certificates for Shares issued pursuant to the Plan and may issue such "stop transfer" instructions to its transfer agent in respect of such Shares as, in its discretion, it determines to be necessary or appropriate to (i) prevent a violation of, or to perfect an exemption from, the registration requirements of the Securities Act,
 
(ii) implement the provisions of the Plan and any agreement between the Company and the optionee or grantee with respect to such Shares, or (iii) permit the Company to determine the occurrence of a disqualifying disposition, as described in Section 421(b) of the Code, of Shares transferred upon exercise of an Incentive Option granted under the Plan.
          The Company shall pay all issue or transfer taxes with respect to the issuance of transfer of Shares, as well as all fees and expenses necessarily incurred by the Company in connection with such issuance or transfer, except fees and expenses which may be necessitated by the filing or amending of a Registration Statement under the Securities Act, which fees and expenses shall be borne by the recipient of the Shares unless such Registration Statement has been filed by the Company for its own corporate purposes (and the Company so states) in which event the recipient of the Shares shall bear only fees and expenses as are attributable solely to the inclusion of the Shares he or she received in the Registration Statement.
          All Shares issued as provided herein shall be fully paid and non-assessable to the extent permitted by law.
          
XVI. WITHHOLDING TAXES
          The Company may require an employee exercising a Right or Non-Qualified Option granted hereunder, or disposing of Shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Incentive Option in a disqualifying disposition (within the meaning of Section 421(b) of the Code), to reimburse the corporation that employs such employee for any taxes required by any government to be withheld or otherwise deducted and paid by such corporation in respect of the issuance or disposition of such Shares. In lieu thereof, the corporation that employs such employee shall have the right to withhold the amount of such taxes from any other sums due or to become due from such corporation to the employee upon such terms and conditions as the Committee shall prescribe. The corporation that employs such employee may, in its discretion, hold the stock certificate to which such employee is entitled upon the exercise of an Option as security for the payment of such withholding tax liability, until cash sufficient to pay that liability has been accumulated. In addition, at any time that the Company becomes subject to a withholding obligation under applicable law with respect to the exercise of a Right or Non-Qualified Option (the "Tax Date"), except as set forth below, a holder of a Right or Non-Qualified Option may elect to satisfy, in whole or in part, the holder's related personal tax liabilities (an "Election") by (i) directing the Company to withhold from Shares issuable in the related exercise either a specified number of Shares or Shares having a specified value (in each case not in excess of the related personal tax liabilities), (ii) tendering Shares previously issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option or Right or other Shares of the Company's common stock owned by the holder or (iii) combining any or all of the foregoing options in any fashion. An Election shall be irrevocable. The withheld Shares and other Shares tendered in payment shall be valued at their fair market value (determined in accordance with the principles set forth in Article V of the Plan) on the Tax Date. The Committee may disapprove of any Election, suspend or terminate the right to make Elections or provide that the right to make Elections shall not apply to particular Shares or exercises. The Committee may prescribe additional rules, in its discretion, to permit a holder of an Option or Right who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to effect such tax withholding in compliance with the Rules promulgated under Section 16 of
 
the Exchange Act and the positions of the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission expressed in no-action or interpretative letters exempting such tax withholding transactions from liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. The Committee may also impose any additional conditions or restrictions on the right to make an Election as it shall deem appropriate.
          
XVII. LISTING OF SHARES AND RELATED MATTERS
          The Committee may delay any award, issuance or delivery of Shares if it determines that listing, registration or qualification of Shares or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the sale or purchase of Shares under the Plan, until such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained, or otherwise provided for, free of any conditions not acceptable to the Committee.
          
XVIII. AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN
          The Board of Directors or the Committee, as the case may be, may, from time to time, amend the Plan, provided that no amendment shall be made, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company, that will (i) increase the total number of Shares reserved for Options under the Plan (other than an increase resulting from an adjustment provided for in Article XII), (ii) reduce the exercise price of any Incentive Option granted hereunder below the price required by Article V, (iii) modify the provisions of the Plan relating to eligibility, or (iv) materially increase the benefits accruing to participants under the Plan. The Board of Directors or the Committee, as the case may be, shall be authorized to amend the Plan and the Options granted thereunder to permit the Incentive Options granted thereunder to qualify as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code. The rights and obligations under any Option or Right granted before amendment of the Plan or any unexercised portion of such Option or Right shall not be adversely affected by amendment of the Plan, Option or Right without the consent of the holder of such Option or Right.
          
XIX. TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF THE PLAN
          The Board of Directors may at any time suspend or terminate the Plan. The Plan, unless sooner terminated by action of the Board of Directors, shall terminate at the close of business on the Termination Date. Options and Rights may not be granted while the Plan is suspended or after it is terminated. Rights and obligations under any Option or Right granted while the Plan is in effect shall not be altered or impaired by suspension or termination of the Plan, except upon the consent of the person to whom the Option or Right was granted. The power of the Committee to construe and administer any Options or Rights granted prior to the termination or suspension of the Plan under Article III nevertheless shall continue after such termination or during such suspension.
          
XX. GOVERNING LAW
          The Plan, such Options and Rights as may be granted thereunder and all related matters shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware from time to time obtaining.
 
          
XXI. PARTIAL INVALIDITY
          The invalidity or illegibility of any provision hereof shall not be deemed to affect the validity of any other provision.
          
XXII. EFFECTIVE DATE
          This Plan became effective at 5:30 P.M., New York City Time, on the Effective Date.

      On May 26, 2005, Black Box Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter and year ended March 31, 2005. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.

      Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, May 26, 2005  Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2005, break-even diluted earnings per share compared to 61 last year. Net income for the fourth quarter was break-even compared to $11.5 million or 8.9% of revenues last year. Excluding restructuring and other charges and reconciling items in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 described below, diluted earnings per share were 39 for the quarter and net income was $6.8 million or 4.3% of revenues.
During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge for restructuring and other charges of $5.1 million. This charge was comprised of $3.0 million for staffing level adjustments and real estate consolidations in Europe and North America, and $2.1 million for the final settlement of a previously disclosed litigation matter. In addition, the Company incurred charges during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 of $5.3 million pre-tax, comprised of acquisition related expenses from the purchase of Norstan, Inc. ("Norstan") on January 25, 2005 of $2.7 million, and $2.6 million of costs associated with the compliance requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Section 404"). Management believes that presenting diluted earnings per share and net income excluding restructuring and other charges and reconciling items is useful to investors because it provides a more meaningful comparison of the ongoing operations of the Company.

In accordance with SEC Regulation G, the attached financial chart includes a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $157 million, an increase of 21% from $130 million last year. On a sequential comparison basis, third quarter revenues were $127 million.
Fourth quarter cash provided by operating activities was $17 million, compared to $27 million last year. On a sequential comparison basis, third quarter cash provided by operating activities was $14 million. Black Box utilized its fourth quarter cash provided by operating activities of $17 million to make a dividend payment of $1 million and $16 million for share repurchases.
For total fiscal year 2005, diluted earnings per share were $1.68 compared to $2.52 last year, down 33%. Corresponding net income for the year was $29.9 million or 5.6% of revenues, compared to $47.2 million or 9.1% of revenues last year. Excluding restructuring and other charges and reconciling items for total fiscal year 2005, diluted earnings per share were $2.13 and net income was $37.9 million or 7.1% of revenues.
In addition to the restructuring and other charges and reconciling items discussed above that were incurred during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005, the Company also incurred $1.8 million of costs associated with the compliance requirements of Section 404 in previous Fiscal 2005 quarters. Total cost for the full fiscal year associated with the completion requirements of Section 404 was $4.4 million.
Total year revenues were $535 million, up 3% from $520 million last year.
Cash provided by operating activities for the year was $52 million or 174% of net income, compared to $75 million or 159% of net income last year. Black Box utilized the total year cash provided by operating activities of $52 million to make dividend payments of $4 million and repurchase $48 million of its Common Stock.
 
Page 3
The Company's 6-month order backlog was $97 million at March 31, 2005 compared to $54 million at the end of the third quarter. The increase in backlog is related to the purchase of Norstan.
The Company has set its worldwide cost structure on the basis of approximately $700 million in annual revenues, or approximately $175 million per quarter. At this revenue level, the Company is targeting gross profits at 40% to 41%, operating expenses excluding depreciation and Norstan acquisition-related expenses, described below, at 26.5% to 27.5% and EBITDA of approximately $95 to $100 million or 13.5% to 14.5% of revenues. Depreciation is estimated at approximately $11 million.
Assuming an overall interest rate of 5%, interest expense is targeted to be approximately $7.5 to $8.5 million or approximately 1.1% of revenues. The effective tax rate is targeted to be approximately 35.0% of pre-tax income. Net income excluding Norstan acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs, described below, is targeted to be approximately $52 to $54 million. Assuming weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding of 18 million, EPS excluding Norstan acquisition-related expenses and restructuring cost is targeted to approximate $2.90 to $3.00 per share.
Norstan acquisition-related expenses will approximate $6.2 million pre-tax in FY06 and $1.4 million in FY07. The corresponding EPS impact is expected to be 23 per share in FY06 and 5 per share in FY07.
The Company expects to record in the first quarter of Fiscal 2006, a $4 to $5 million pre-tax restructuring charge, or 14 to 18 per share, to complete its staffing level adjustments in Europe and North America and real estate consolidations. In combination with the $3 million restructuring recorded in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005, the Company will reduce its operating costs by $11 to $12 million annually.
 
Page 4
Cash provided by operating activities after these items is targeted to be in a range of $68 to $73 million. New capital expenditures are targeted to approximate $6 million.
All of the above targets are before any new mergers and acquisition activity that has not been announced.
Commenting on past year and future, Fred C. Young, Chief Executive Officer, said, "Fourth quarter revenues grew 21% to $159 million and total year revenues grew 3% to $535 million. For FY06 we expect revenues to grow 31% to $700 million. We are also targeting to aggressively increase market share via our M&A program with a 12-month goal of $150 to $200 million in additional annualized revenues. Funding for this expansion will come from operating cash flow, existing lines of credit and stock issuances. Looking beyond FY06, we have established a goal of one billion dollars in revenues by the end of FY07.
"We have spent considerable time and money restructuring our worldwide cost structure to achieve targeted future profits and cash flows. This requires a restructuring charge in 4Q05 and 1Q06, and although costly, we believe these actions are operationally necessary and financially beneficial going forward.
"In support of attaining our financial targets we will aggressively market our Data, Voice and Hotline Technical Services, or what we call DVH Services. Our Technical Services Model is unique in the industry and we believe provides the best value proposition to our clients. For Fiscal 2006 we expect our revenue mix by technical service to be 28% Data Services, 43% Voice Services and 29% Hotline Services. Geographically we expect our revenue mix to be 75% North America and 25% International. Over time we will look to increase our international presence.

"We continue to have high expectations from our recent Norstan acquisition. The integration program is proceeding per our plan which included re-branding Norstan to Black Box throughout North America.
"In closing, we have high expectations for the future of Black Box. Achieving these expectations will require us to successfully complete the Norstan integration, aggressively sell our DVH services and consummate high quality M&A opportunities."
During FY05, the Company repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $57 million. Funding for the stock repurchases came primarily from cash flow from operations. Since inception of the repurchase program in April 1999 through March 31, 2005, the Company has repurchased in aggregate approximately 6.9 million shares for $297 million. Repurchases of stock during FY06 will occur from time to time depending upon factors such as the Company's cash flows and general market conditions. While the Company expects to continue to repurchase shares for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of such repurchases.
The Company will conduct a conference call beginning at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time today, May 26, 2005. Fred Young, Chief Executive Officer, will host the call. To participate in the call, please dial 612-332-0802 approximately 15 minutes prior to the starting time and ask to be connected to the Black Box Earnings Call. A replay of the conference call will be available for two weeks after the teleconference by dialing 320-365-3844 and using access code 781061.
The Company expects to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, June 14, 2005. The Annual Report and Proxy Statement are expected to be mailed at the end of June 2005 to stockholders of record as of June 10, 2005. The Company's Annual Stockholders Meeting will be held in Pittsburgh, PA on Tuesday, August 9, 2005.

EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, May 31, 2005  In BW5901 issued May 26, 2005: Please replace the release dated May 26, 2005 with the following corrected version due to revisions.
The corrected release reads:
Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2005, break-even diluted earnings per share compared to 61 last year. Net income for the fourth quarter was break-even compared to $11.5 million or 8.9% of revenues last year. Excluding restructuring and other charges and reconciling items in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 described below, diluted earnings per share were 39 for the quarter and net income was $6.8 million or 4.3% of revenues.
During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge for restructuring and other charges of $5.1 million. This charge was comprised of $3.0 million for staffing level adjustments and real estate consolidations in Europe and North America, and $2.1 million for the final settlement of a previously disclosed litigation matter. In addition, the Company incurred charges during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 of $5.3 million pre-tax, comprised of acquisition related expenses from the purchase of Norstan, Inc. ("Norstan") on January 25, 2005 of $2.7 million, and $2.6 million of costs associated with the compliance requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Section 404"). Management believes that presenting diluted earnings per share and net income excluding restructuring and other charges and reconciling items is useful to investors because it provides a more meaningful comparison of the ongoing operations of the Company.
 
Page 2
In accordance with SEC Regulation G, the attached financial charts include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $157 million, an increase of 21% from $130 million last year. On a sequential comparison basis, third quarter revenues were $127 million.
Fourth quarter cash provided by operating activities was $18 million, compared to $27 million last year. On a sequential comparison basis, third quarter cash provided by operating activities was $14 million. Black Box utilized its fourth quarter cash provided by operating activities of $18 million to make a dividend payment of $1 million and $17 million for share repurchases.
For total fiscal year 2005, diluted earnings per share were $1.68 compared to $2.52 last year, down 33%. Corresponding net income for the year was $29.9 million or 5.6% of revenues, compared to $47.2 million or 9.1% of revenues last year. Excluding restructuring and other charges and reconciling items for total fiscal year 2005, diluted earnings per share were $2.13 and net income was $37.9 million or 7.1% of revenues.
In addition to the restructuring and other charges and reconciling items discussed above that were incurred during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005, the Company also incurred $1.8 million of costs associated with the compliance requirements of Section 404 in previous Fiscal 2005 quarters. Total cost for the full fiscal year associated with the compliance requirements of Section 404 was $4.4 million.
Total year revenues were $535 million, up 3% from $520 million last year.
Cash provided by operating activities for the year was $52 million or 175% of net income, compared to $75 million or 159% of net income last year. Black Box utilized the total year cash provided by operating activities of $52 million to make dividend payments of $4 million and repurchase $48 million of its Common Stock.
 
Page 3
The Company's 6-month order backlog was $97 million at March 31, 2005 compared to $54 million at the end of the third quarter. The increase in backlog is related to the purchase of Norstan.
The Company has set its worldwide cost structure on the basis of approximately $700 million in annual revenues, or approximately $175 million per quarter. At this revenue level, the Company is targeting gross profits at 40% to 41%, SG&A expenses excluding depreciation and Norstan acquisition-related expenses, described below, at 26.5% to 27.5% and EBITDA of approximately $95 to $100 million or 13.5% to 14.5% of revenues. Depreciation is estimated at approximately $11 million.
Assuming an overall interest rate of 5%, interest expense is targeted to be approximately $7.5 to $8.5 million or approximately 1.1% of revenues. The effective tax rate is targeted to be approximately 35.0% of pre-tax income. Net income excluding Norstan acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs, described below, is targeted to be approximately $52 to $54 million. Assuming weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding of 18 million, EPS excluding Norstan acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs is targeted to approximate $2.90 to $3.00 per share.
Norstan acquisition-related expenses will approximate $6.2 million pre-tax in FY06 and $1.4 million in FY07. The corresponding EPS impact is expected to be 23 per share in FY06 and 5 per share in FY07.
The Company expects to record in the first quarter of Fiscal 2006, a $4 to $5 million pre-tax restructuring charge, or 14 to 18 per share, to complete its staffing level adjustments in Europe and North America and real estate consolidations. In combination with the $3 million restructuring recorded in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005, the Company will reduce its operating costs by $11 to $12 million annually.
Cash provided by operating activities after these items is targeted to be in a range of $68 to $73 million. New capital expenditures are targeted to approximate $6 million.
 
Page 4
All of the above targets are before any new mergers and acquisition activity that has not been announced.
Commenting on past year and future, Fred C. Young, Chief Executive Officer, said, "Fourth quarter revenues grew 21% to $157 million and total year revenues grew 3% to $535 million. For FY06 we expect revenues to grow 31% to $700 million. We are also targeting to aggressively increase market share via our M&A program with a 12-month goal of $150 to $200 million in additional annualized revenues. Funding for this expansion will come from operating cash flow, existing lines of credit and stock issuances. Looking beyond FY06, we have established a goal of one billion dollars in revenues by the end of FY07.
"We have spent considerable time and money restructuring our worldwide cost structure to achieve targeted future profits and cash flows. This requires a restructuring charge in 4Q05 and 1Q06, and although costly, we believe these actions are operationally necessary and financially beneficial going forward.
"In support of attaining our financial targets we will aggressively market our Data, Voice and Hotline Technical Services, or what we call DVH Services. Our Technical Services Model is unique in the industry and we believe provides the best value proposition to our clients. For Fiscal 2006 we expect our revenue mix by technical service to be 28% Data Services, 43% Voice Services and 29% Hotline Services. Geographically we expect our revenue mix to be 75% North America and 25% International. Over time we will look to increase our international presence.
"We continue to have high expectations from our recent Norstan acquisition. The integration program is proceeding per our plan which included re-branding Norstan to Black Box throughout North America.
 
Page 5
"In closing, we have high expectations for the future of Black Box. Achieving these expectations will require us to successfully complete the Norstan integration, aggressively sell our DVH services and consummate high quality M&A opportunities."
During FY05, the Company repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $57 million. Funding for the stock repurchases came primarily from cash flow from operations. Since inception of the repurchase program in April 1999 through March 31, 2005, the Company has repurchased in aggregate approximately 6.9 million shares for $297 million. Repurchases of stock during FY06 will occur from time to time depending upon factors such as the Company's cash flows and general market conditions. While the Company expects to continue to repurchase shares for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of such repurchases.
The Company will conduct a conference call beginning at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time today, May 26, 2005. Fred Young, Chief Executive Officer, will host the call. To participate in the call, please dial 612-332-0802 approximately 15 minutes prior to the starting time and ask to be connected to the Black Box Earnings Call.

The Company expects to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, June 14, 2005. The Annual Report and Proxy Statement are expected to be mailed at the end of June 2005 to stockholders of record as of June 10, 2005.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, July 28, 2005  Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported for the first quarter ended July 2, 2005 diluted earnings per share of 43 compared to 54 last year. Net income for the first quarter was $7.4 million or 4.1% of revenues, compared to $10.0 million or 8.0% of revenues last year. Excluding restructuring charges and acquisition related expenses in the first quarter of Fiscal 2006 described below, diluted earnings per share were 75 for the quarter and net income was $12.7 million or 7.1% of revenues.
During the first quarter of Fiscal 2006, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $5.3 million related to staffing level adjustments and real estate consolidations in Europe and North America. These restructuring charges complete the Company's previously announced restructuring plans that were initiated during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. In addition, the Company incurred non-cash charges during the first quarter of Fiscal 2006 of $2.8 million pre-tax in connection with acquisition related expenses from the fourth quarter Fiscal 2005 purchase of Norstan, Inc. ("Norstan"). Management believes that presenting diluted earnings per share and net income excluding restructuring charges and acquisition related expenses is useful to investors because it provides a more meaningful comparison of the ongoing operations of the Company.
 
Page 2
In accordance with SEC Regulation G, the attached financial charts include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
Total revenues for the first quarter were $179 million, an increase of 44% from $124 million last year. On a sequential comparison basis, fourth quarter revenues were $157 million.
First quarter cash provided by operating activities was $11 million or 146% of net income, compared to $9 million or 92% of net income last year. On a sequential comparison basis, fourth quarter cash provided by operating activities was $18 million. Black Box utilized its first quarter cash provided by operating activities of $11 million to fund $10 million of mergers completed during the quarter and a dividend payment of $1 million.
The Company's 6-month order backlog was $97 million at June 30, 2005 compared to $97 million at the end of the fourth quarter.
Commenting on the quarter, Fred C. Young, Chief Executive Officer, said, "Overall, we are very pleased with our 1Q06 results. Key metrics that include revenue, profit and operating cash flow were consistent with our targeted ranges. Revenue mix percentages by service type continue to evolve and diversify towards on-site in general and voice services specifically. Relative to total revenues Data Services were 30% compared to last year's 39%; Voice Services were 40% compared to last year's 15%; and Hotline Services were 30% compared to last year's 46%."
Continuing on, Mr. Young said, "The integration plan for our recent Norstan merger, now Black Box  Minnetonka, is progressing well. During the quarter we also successfully merged with three additional technical services companies, which primarily provide voice services in the Florida and Virginia market places.
"In summary, as we look forward our goal is to build upon this quarter's positive momentum. We will remain focused on our two primary objectives. First and foremost, cross-sell and deliver Black Box's industry-leading DVH Services (Data, Voice and Hotline) to all clients. And secondly, leverage Black Box's financial strength via additional selected M&A activity."

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, November 1, 2005  Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported for the second quarter ended October 1, 2005 diluted earnings per share of 74 compared to 60 last year. Net income for the second quarter was $12.8 million or 6.9% of revenues, compared to $10.6 million or 8.4% of revenues last year. On a sequential comparison basis, first quarter diluted earnings per share were 43 with corresponding net income of $7.4 million or 4.1% of revenues.

During the second quarter of Fiscal 2006, the Company incurred non-cash charges of $1.3 million pre-tax in connection with acquisition related expenses from the fourth quarter Fiscal 2005 purchase of Norstan, Inc.

Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company.
In accordance with SEC Regulation G, the attached financial charts include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
For the six months ended October 1, 2005, diluted earnings per share were $1.17 compared to $1.14 for the same period last year, up 3%. Corresponding net income for the six-month period was $20.2 million or 5.5% of revenues, compared to $20.6 million or 8.2% of revenues for the same period last year. Excluding restructuring charges and acquisition related expenses for the six months ended October 1, 2005 described below, diluted earnings per share were $1.53 and net income was $26.3 million or 7.2% of revenues.
Total non-cash charges incurred for the six months ended October 1, 2005 associated with acquisition related expenses of Norstan was $4.1 million pre-tax. For the six-month period ended October 1, 2005, the Company incurred a pre-tax restructuring charge of $5.3 million related to staffing level adjustments and real estate consolidations in Europe and North America.
Total six-month revenues were $364 million, up 45% from $251 million for the same period last year.

Cash provided by operating activities for the six-month period was $22 million or 111% of net income, compared to $21 million or 100% of net income last year. Free cash flow was $29 million compared to $24 million last year. Black Box utilized the six-month free cash flow of $29 million to fund $27 million of mergers and prior merger-related activity completed during the period and dividend payments of $2 million.
The Company's 6-month order backlog was $104 million at October 1, 2005 compared to $97 million at the end of the first quarter.
Commenting on the second quarter results, Fred C. Young, Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are pleased with our overall second quarter results. This quarter was the best quarter we have had in over two years as measured by the composite of total revenue, organic revenue growth, absolute EPS performance and cash flow. Contributing factors to this success include an improved global economy, excellent day-to-day execution and the successful integration of our mergers and acquisitions activity. Within the 46% total revenue growth over last year, we are particularly pleased with our 3% organic growth over last year and 4% organic growth from the sequential first quarter."
Continuing on, Mr. Young said, "We like Black Box's current global leadership position in the communications marketplace. And we will look to build upon this leadership position via our major strength  seamlessly delivering the highest quality data, voice and hotline technical services to our clients around the world."

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On October 31, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of Black Box Corporation (the "Company") authorized the acceleration of vesting of all of the Company's outstanding out-of-the-money unvested stock options held by directors and employees of the Company, including its Named Executive Officers (as such term is defined in the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission). Such stock options had an exercise price greater than $39.77, the average of the daily high and the daily low price of the Company's common stock, par value $.001 ("Common Stock"), on the Nasdaq National Market as of that date. As a result of vesting acceleration, options to acquire approximately 405,224 shares of the Common Stock, which otherwise would have vested from time to time over the next three years, became immediately exercisable. All other terms and conditions applicable to such stock options remained in effect. The accelerated options represent approximately 7% of the Company's total outstanding options. The option plans under which the accelerated grants were issued are the 1992 Stock Option Plan and the 1992 Director Stock Option Plan.
     The following table summarizes the outstanding options subject to accelerated vesting:
     The Compensation Committee's decision to accelerate the vesting of out-of-the-money unvested stock options was based upon the issuance by the Financial Accounting Standards Board of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123 (Revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS No. 123R"), which will require the Company to treat unvested stock options as compensation expense in future periods effective April 1, 2006. The acceleration eliminates future compensation expense the Company would otherwise have been required to recognize in its income statements in such future periods. In addition, the Compensation Committee discussed (i) the ramifications of acceleration, including the fact that a retention feature of such options remained since the exercise price of the options was greater than the fair market value of the stock and that such options would be forfeited upon termination of employment, (ii) that options were not meeting their original objectives of incentive compensation and (iii) the favorable effect of the acceleration on employee morale, retention and perception of option value.
 
     By accelerating the vesting of these out-of-the-money unvested stock options, the Company has elected to recognize compensation expense in the third quarter of Fiscal 2006 for such accelerated stock options. Since the Company accounts for its stock options granted to employees and directors using the intrinsic-value method under the guidelines of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," the Company will report the compensation expense related to the accelerated options for disclosure purposes only in its financial statements for its third fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2005 as permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure  an Amendment of SFAS No. 123." The Company believes that acceleration of vesting of the 405,224 stock options will eliminate the need for recognizing future pre-tax compensation expense of approximately $3.7 million ($1.4 million of this amount is attributable to acceleration of vesting of options held by Directors and Named Executive Officers) over the remaining option terms in its financial statements after the Company adopts SFAS No. 123R as of April 1, 2006. This compensation expense was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which is used by the Company to calculate the fair value of its options in determining the pro forma impact of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," for disclosure purposes only.

Exhibit 99.1
Michael McAndrew, Chief Financial Officer Black Box Corporation (724) 873-6788 (724) 873-6799 (fax) Email: investors@blackbox.com
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, January 31, 2006  Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported for the third quarter ended December 31, 2005 diluted earnings per share of 70 compared to 52 last year, an increase of 35%. Net income for the third quarter was $12.5 million or 6.9% of revenues, compared to $9.2 million or 7.3% of revenues last year. On a sequential comparison basis, second quarter diluted earnings per share were 74 with corresponding net income of $12.8 million or 6.9% of revenues. Excluding acquisition related expenses in the third quarter of Fiscal 2006 described below, diluted earnings per share were 75 and net income was $13.3 million or 7.3% of revenues.
During the third quarter of Fiscal 2006, the Company incurred non-cash charges of $1.2 million pre-tax in connection with acquisition related expenses from the January 25, 2005 purchase of Norstan, Inc. ("Norstan"). Management believes that presenting diluted earnings per share and net income excluding acquisition related expenses is useful to investors because it provides a more meaningful comparison of the ongoing operations of the Company.
Total revenues for the third quarter were $182 million, an increase of 44% from $127 million for the same period last year. On a sequential comparison basis, second quarter revenues were $185 million.
 
Page 2
Third quarter cash provided by operating activities was approximately $16 million or 131% of net income, compared to $14 million or 148% of net income for the same period last year. Third quarter free cash flow was $24 million compared to $14 million last year. On a sequential comparison basis, second quarter cash provided by operating activities was $12 million and free cash flow was $18 million. Black Box utilized its third quarter free cash flow of $24 million to fund $14 million of merger-related activity; debt reduction of $8 million; a dividend payment of $1 million; and net capital expenditures of $1 million. Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company.
In accordance with SEC Regulation G, the attached financial charts include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2005, diluted earnings per share were $1.88 compared to $1.66 for the same period last year, an increase of 13%. Corresponding net income for the nine-month period was $32.7 million or 6.0% of revenues, compared to $29.9 million or 7.9% of revenues for the same period last year. Excluding restructuring charges and acquisition related expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2005 described below, diluted earnings per share were $2.28 and net income was $39.7 million or 7.3% of revenues.
Total non-cash charges incurred for the nine months ended December 31, 2005 associated with acquisition related expenses of Norstan was $5.4 million pre-tax. For the nine-month period ended December 31, 2005, the Company incurred a pre-tax restructuring charge of $5.3 million related to staffing level adjustments and real estate consolidations in Europe and North America.
Total nine-month revenues were $546 million, an increase of 45% from $378 million for the same period last year.
 
Page 3
Cash provided by operating activities for the nine-month period was $39 million or 119% of net income, compared to $34 million or 115% of net income last year.

Black Box utilized the nine-month free cash flow of $53 million to fund $41 million of merger-related activity; debt reduction of $7 million; dividend payments of $3 million; and net capital expenditures of $2 million.
The Company's 6-month order backlog was $94 million at December 31, 2005 compared to $54 million at the same period last year. On a sequential comparison basis, second quarter 6-month order backlog was $101 million.
Commenting on the third quarter results, Fred C. Young, Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are pleased with our overall results for the quarter and nine-months to date.

TM
Continuing on, Mr. Young said, "Our goals moving forward will be to finish FY06 strong and carry this momentum into our FY07."
The Company will conduct a conference call beginning at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time today, January 31, 2006. Fred C. Young, Chief Executive Officer, will host the call.

Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
     On April 30, 2006, pursuant to an Interest Purchase Agreement by and between Platinum Equity, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Platinum"), and Black Box Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Black Box"), as amended by the Amendment to the Interest Purchase Agreement (the "Amendment") by and between Platinum and Black Box dated as of April 30, 2006 (collectively, the "Purchase Agreement"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Black Box purchased (the "Acquisition") 100% of the outstanding membership interests of NextiraOne, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("NXO"), NextiraOne New York, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("NXO NY"), and NextiraOne Federal, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("NXO Federal"), and 100% of the partnership interests of NextiraOne California L.P., a California limited liability partnership ("NXO CA," and, together with NXO, NXO NY and NXO Federal, the "Companies"). The Companies, along with certain subsidiaries of the Companies that are also being acquired in the Acquisition (the "Subsidiaries"), are engaged in the business of providing integrated enterprise network, IP telephony, voice and data solutions and services to customers in the commercial marketplace primarily in the United States and Canada as well as to the United States government, United States government agencies and United States government contractors. A copy of the Amendment is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto.
     The purchase price for the Acquisition was $97,305,000, including a pre-closing reduction of the purchase price of $6,645,000 based on the estimated equity book value of the Companies and Subsidiaries (total assets less total liabilities, as adjusted by the parties for certain items) as of the closing date. The purchase price is subject to a post-closing determination of the actual equity book value as of the closing date. The purchase price was paid in cash which was borrowed under Black Box's Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended. See Item 2.03 herein.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation of a Registrant.
     The purchase price for the Acquisition was borrowed under Black Box's Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of January 24, 2005, by and among Norstan, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (as successor to SF Acquisition Co.), Black Box Corporation of Pennsylvania, a Delaware corporation, Black Box, certain subsidiaries of Black Box which are guarantors, each of the "Lender" parties thereto (the "Lenders") and Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania, a banking association organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as administrative agent for the Lenders thereunder, as amended by that First Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of February 17, 2005 (the "First Amendment"), and as further amended by that Second Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of March 28, 2006 (the "Second Amendment," and, together with the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and the First Amendment, the "Existing Credit Agreement"). Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the revolving credit commitments of the Lenders was increased from $240,000,000 to $310,000,000 and the maturity date of the Existing Credit Agreement was extended to March 28, 2011. Changes were also made to certain covenants contained in the Existing Credit Agreement. A copy of the Second Amendment is filed as Exhibit 2.2 hereto.

               (iii) by amending and restating the first sentence of Section 9.2(b) to read in its entirety as follows: "Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent commercially feasible, prior to any payment by Black Box under any of the matters referred to in , through , as applicable, Black Box shall provide to Platinum a written notice detailing the amount of such proposed payment and a copy or description of the plan or agreement (whether oral or written) pursuant to which such request for payment has been made."

Platinum and Black Box shall cooperate and work together in good faith to negotiate with each Landlord to either (i) obtain a Landlord Consent, or (ii) secure from such Landlord a waiver of any such consent requirement, in each case on commercially reasonable and customary terms reasonably acceptable to Black Box.

The obligation of Platinum to provide indemnification for any Losses arising out of or in connection with its the failure to obtain the Landlord Consents prior to the date hereof as set forth in the new Section 9.1(a)(xxix) of the Agreement provided for in Section 3 of this Amendment shall not extend to any Losses arising directly or indirectly from any violation by Black Box of its agreements in this Section 4.

Exhibit 99.1
Michael McAndrew, Chief Financial Officer Black Box Corporation (724) 873-6788 (724) 873-6799 (fax) Email: investors@blackbox.com
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, June 1, 2006  Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2006 diluted earnings per share of 26 on net income of $4.7 million or 2.7% of revenues compared to break-even last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, third quarter diluted earnings per share were 70 with corresponding net income of $12.5 million or 6.9% of revenues. Excluding restructuring charges and reconciling items described below, diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter 2006 were 53 and net income was $9.6 million or 5.5% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of 39 and net income of $6.8 million or 4.3% of revenues for the fourth quarter 2005. Management believes that presenting diluted earnings per share and net income excluding restructuring charges and reconciling items is useful to investors because it provides a more meaningful comparison of the ongoing operations of the Company.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company incurred a pre-tax charge of $7.5 million related to reconciling items. Of this charge, $7.1 million relates to an adjustment of earnings over multiple years, from FY03 through FY06, from the Company's Italian Operations ("Italian Operations Adjustment"). The Italian Operations Adjustment resulted from intentional misconduct by certain local operational and financial management of the Company's Italian Operations acting in collusion with one another for the purpose of overstating local financial results. All involved team members have been terminated and the Company intends to pursue all available legal remedies against these individuals. The misconduct was recently brought to the Company management's attention by a team member of the Italian Operations pursuant to the
 
Page 2
Company's "Open Door" Policy. Company management responded by immediately suspending the management team of the Italian Operations and conducting a full investigation of the matter. The Company believes that all accounting irregularities have been identified, corrective action taken, and that the Italian Operations Adjustment captures all necessary corrections. These corrections were not material to any prior reporting period.
Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $175 million, an increase of 11% from $157 million for the same period last year. On a sequential comparison basis, third quarter revenues were $182 million.
Fourth quarter cash provided by operating activities was approximately $13 million or 276% of net income, compared to $18 million for the same period last year. Fourth quarter free cash flow (defined below) was $19 million compared to $18 million last year. On a sequential comparison basis, third quarter cash provided by operating activities was $16 million or 131% of net income and free cash flow was $24 million. Black Box utilized its fourth quarter free cash flow of $19 million to fund debt reduction of $18 million and a dividend payment of $1 million. Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company.
For total fiscal 2006, diluted earnings per share were $2.13 compared to $1.68 for the same period last year, an increase of 27%. Corresponding net income for the year was $37.4 million or 5.2% of revenues, compared to $29.9 million or 5.6% of revenues for the same period last year. Excluding restructuring charges and reconciling items for fiscal years 2006 and 2005, diluted earnings per share were $2.81 and net income was $49.3 million or 6.8% of revenues in 2006 compared to diluted earnings per share of $2.13 and net income of $37.9 million or 7.1% of revenues in 2005.
Total pre-tax charges incurred for the fiscal year 2006 were: $5.4 million associated with acquisition-related expenses of Norstan; a restructuring charge of $5.3 million related to staffing level adjustments and real estate consolidations in Europe and North America; and a charge of $7.1 million related to the Italian Operations Adjustment.
 
Page 3
Revenues for fiscal year 2006 were $721 million, an increase of 35% from $535 million for fiscal year 2005.
Cash provided by operating activities for the year was $52 million or 139% of net income, compared to $52 million or 175% of net income last year. Free cash flow was $72 million compared to $57 million last year. Black Box utilized the twelve-month free cash flow of $72 million to fund $41 million of acquisition-related activity; debt reduction of $27 million; and dividend payments of $4 million.
The Company's 6-month order backlog was $96 million at March 31, 2006 compared to $97 million at the same period last year. On a sequential comparison basis, third quarter 6-month order backlog was $94 million.
For FY07, the Company expects total year reported revenues of approximately $1 billion. By 2Q07, the Company currently expects quarterly revenues in the range of $265 to $275 million; gross profit margin in the range of 37% to 38%; SG&A expenses in the range of 26% to 27%; corresponding EPS in the range of 90 to 95; and quarterly cash provided by operating activities in the range of $20 to $22 million.
All of the above ranges exclude acquisition-related expense and stock option-based expense (including the impact of FAS 123(R)), and are before any new mergers and acquisition activity that has not been announced.
Commenting on FY06 and the future outlook, Fred C. Young, Chief Executive Officer, said, "Black Box had many significant accomplishments in FY06. We are particularly pleased that strategically we have successfully positioned Black Box to reach the $1 billion revenue milestone in FY07, effectively doubling our business from 15 months ago. Achieving this $1 billion milestone 12 months ahead of our previously established timeframe is a significant event. On the other hand, as we conclude FY06 we are very disappointed by the situation in Italy. By no means do we believe this misconduct is representative of the overall integrity of the Black Box Team at large.
 
Page 4
Mr. Young went on to say, "FY07 should be a record year for Black Box. We believe the 2Q07 timetable we have established to achieve our financial targets is reasonable given our historical track record, particularly with the experience and associated results of the Norstan acquisition.
"There was a tremendous amount of planning and execution required to ensure the NextiraOne transaction was completed in a manner which we felt would meet both our operational and financial objectives. We believe we have accomplished this. From an industry positioning perspective, this combination significantly strengthens Black Box's leadership position for data, voice and hotline technical services.
"Our FY07 plan is to fully integrate NextiraOne into Black Box. We believe this will allow us to take full advantage of combined synergies in all functional areas. This applies particularly to marketing and operations, where we now have a significant increase in resources available to our clients, and the overall implementation of a much more efficient cost management philosophy. The Black Box technical services model is very unique in the industry and we believe provides the best value proposition to our clients.
"For FY07 we expect our revenue mix by technical service to be approximately 16% data services, 65% voice services and 19% hotline services. Geographically we expect our revenue mix to be approximately 85% North America and 15% International. Over time we will look to increase our International revenue mix.
"In closing, we have high expectations for the future of Black Box and will stay focused on the tasks at hand. Achieving these expectations will require us to successfully complete the integration of all of our FY06 acquisitions, aggressively sell our DVH services everyday throughout the world and continue to leverage our financial strength into significant growth by consummating high quality M&A opportunities."
The historical information in this press release and the attached tables does not include the acquisitions of NextiraOne and NuVision which closed on April 30, 2006, and May 1, 2006, respectively.

Non-GAAP Measurements
The financial information presented in this release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses the non-GAAP measures to improve comparisons between fiscal periods. Management believes the use of the non-GAAP measures improves the investor's ability to make comparisons between fiscal periods and provide more useful information to investors regarding the Company's financial condition and its results of operations. In accordance with SEC Regulation G, the following financial highlights tables reconcile (1) free cash flow; (2) cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments and satisfaction of a litigation judgment; (3) net income excluding restructuring charges and reconciling items; and (4) diluted EPS excluding restructuring charges and reconciling items; to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. All dollar amounts are in thousands.
Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company. A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
Management believes that presenting cash provided by operating activities exclusive of the cash flow impact from items that rarely occur or only occur once is a more meaningful measurement of cash provided by operating activities on an ongoing basis and allows the reader to more accurately compare other fiscal periods where the events did not occur. A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments and satisfaction of a litigation judgment is presented below:
 
Page 10
Management believes that presenting net income and diluted earnings per share excluding restructuring charges and reconciling items is useful to investors because it provides a more meaningful comparison of the ongoing operations of the Company. Included in reconciling items are acquisition-related expenses from the purchase of Norstan and the Italian Operations Adjustment in FY06 and acquisition-related expenses from the purchase of Norstan, settlement of a litigation matter and costs associated with the establishment and review of procedures to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in FY05. A reconciliation of net income to net income excluding restructuring charges and reconciling items is presented below:
A reconciliation of diluted earnings per common share (EPS) to diluted EPS excluding restructuring charges and reconciling items is presented below:

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:
Additionally, the following supplemental information is being provided for comparisons of fourth quarter ended March 31, 2006 reported results to this year's third quarter and prior year's fourth quarter. All dollar amounts are in thousands unless noted otherwise.
Information on revenues and operating income by geography is presented below. Management believes it is important to separately present the restructuring charges and reconciling items. Reconciling items consist of acquisition-related expenses from the purchase of Norstan and the Italian Operations Adjustment in the 2006 periods and acquisition-related expenses from the purchase of Norstan, settlement of a litigation matter and costs associated with the establishment and review of procedures to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in the 2005 periods. Management believes this enables a clearer understanding of the ongoing operations of the Company and allows the reader to more accurately compare other fiscal periods where the events did not occur.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, August 1, 2006  Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported for the Fiscal 2007 first quarter ended July 1, 2006 diluted earnings per share of 43 on net income of $7.8 million or 3.4% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of 43 on net income of $7.4 million or 4.1% of revenues for the first quarter a year ago. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, fourth quarter 2006 diluted earnings per share were 26 with corresponding net income of $4.7 million or 2.7% of revenues. Excluding the reconciling items and restructuring charges described below, first quarter 2007 diluted earnings per share were 58 on net income of $10.5 million or 4.6% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of 75 on net income of $12.7 million or 7.1% of revenues for the first quarter 2006. Management believes that presenting diluted earnings per share and net income excluding restructuring charges and reconciling items is useful to investors because it provides a more meaningful comparison of the ongoing operations of the Company.
As of April 1, 2006 the Company implemented Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123R which requires share based compensation to be charged to expense. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2007, the Company's reconciling items include pre-tax charges of $1.6 million for share based compensation, $1.4 million in acquisition related expenses and charges of $1.1 million in severance expenses. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2006 and as previously disclosed, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $5.3 million and incurred pre-tax non-cash charges of $2.8 million related to acquisitions.
Total revenues for the first quarter were $230 million, an increase of 29% from $179 million for the same period last year. On a sequential comparison basis, fourth quarter 2006 revenues were $175 million.
First quarter cash provided by operating activities was approximately $13 million or 161% of net income, compared to $11 million or 146% for the same period last year. First quarter free cash flow (defined below) was $14 million compared to $11 million last year. On a sequential comparison basis, fourth quarter 2006 cash provided by operating activities was $13 million or 276% of net income and free cash flow was $19 million. Black Box utilized its first quarter free cash flow of $14 million to fund debt reduction of $13 million and a dividend payment of $1 million. Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company.
The Company's 6-month order backlog was $168 million at July 1, 2006 compared to $97 million at the same period last year. On a sequential comparison basis, fourth quarter 2006 6-month order backlog was $96 million.
During the first quarter 2007, Black Box completed two acquisitions. On April 30, 2006, Black Box acquired the USA Commercial and Government and Canadian operations of NextiraOne, LLC ("NextiraOne") from Platinum Equity, LLC. The acquired operations service commercial and various government agency clients and represent approximately $270 million to $280 million of projected annualized voice services revenues.

On May 1, 2006, Black Box acquired Nu-Vision Technologies, Inc. and Nu-Vision Technologies, LLC (collectively referred to as "NUVT"), which provide planning, installation, monitoring and maintenance services for voice and data network systems. NUVT has an active customer base, which includes commercial, education and various government agency accounts and is expected to provide annual revenues of approximately $55 million.
Commenting on the first quarter results, Fred C. Young, Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are very pleased to have achieved our objective of record revenues for 1Q07. From here, our next objective is to increase profits and cash flows in line with what we have previously outlined. This should result in a marked improvement in these 2 key operating metrics for our 2Q07. And again, we should be able to achieve another level of record revenues."
Fred C. Young went on to say, "Now at the one billion level of annual revenues, we will aggressively position our DVH (Data Services, Voice Services and Hotline Technical Services) and associated cost structures accordingly."

Non-GAAP Measurements
The financial information presented in this release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses the non-GAAP measures to improve the comparisons between fiscal periods. Management believes the use of the non-GAAP measures improves the investor's ability to make comparisons between fiscal periods and provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's financial condition and its results of operations. In accordance with SEC Regulation G, the following financial highlights tables reconcile (1) free cash flow; (2) net income excluding restructuring charges and reconciling items; and (3) diluted EPS excluding restructuring charges and reconciling items; to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. All dollar amounts are in thousands.
Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company. A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
Management believes that presenting net income and diluted earnings per share excluding restructuring charges and reconciling items is useful to investors because it provides a more meaningful comparison of the ongoing operations of the Company. Included in reconciling items are pre-tax charges for share based compensation, acquisition related costs and severance expenses in 1Q07, acquisition-related expenses from the purchase of Norstan and the Italian Operations Adjustment previously disclosed in 4Q06 and acquisition-related expenses from the purchase of Norstan and restructuring charges in 1Q06. A reconciliation of net income to net income excluding restructuring charges and reconciling items is presented below:

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: Additionally, the following supplemental information is being provided for comparisons of the first quarter ended July 1, 2006 reported results to the prior quarter ended March 31, 2006 and the prior year's first quarter ended July 2, 2005. All dollar amounts are in thousands unless noted otherwise.
Information on revenues and operating income by geography is presented below. Management believes it is important to separately present the restructuring charges and reconciling items. Included in reconciling items are charges for share based compensation, acquisition related costs and severance expenses in 1Q07, acquisition-related expenses from the purchase of Norstan and the Italian Operations Adjustment previously disclosed in 4Q06 and acquisition-related expenses from the purchase of Norstan and restructuring charges in 1Q06. Management believes this enables a clearer understanding of the ongoing operations of the Company and allows the reader to more accurately compare other fiscal periods where the events did not occur.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, October 31, 2006  Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported for second quarter Fiscal 2007 ended September 30, 2006 diluted earnings per share of 74 on net income of $13.1 million or 4.8% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of 74 on net income of $12.8 million or 6.9% of revenues for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, first quarter Fiscal 2007 diluted earnings per share were 43 on net income of $7.8 million or 3.4% of revenues. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) for second quarter Fiscal 2007 were 91 on operating net income (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) of $16.1 million or 5.9% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of 78 on operating net income of $13.6 million or 7.4% of revenues for the same quarter last year. Management believes that presenting operating earnings per share and operating net income excluding reconciling items is useful to investors because it provides a more meaningful comparison of the ongoing operations of the Company.
During second quarter Fiscal 2007, the Company's reconciling items included pre-tax charges of $1.9 million for amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, $1.6 million for stock-based compensation expense, and $1.2 million for asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions. The impact of these reconciling items after tax on net income and EPS is $3.0 million and 17, respectively. During second quarter Fiscal 2006, as previously disclosed, the Company's reconciling items included pre-tax charges of $1.1 million for amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions and $0.2 million for asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions. The impact of
 
Page 2
these reconciling items after tax on net income and EPS is $0.8 million and 5, respectively. See below for further discussion regarding Management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements.
Second quarter Fiscal 2007 total revenues were $271 million, an increase of $86 million or 47% from $185 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, second quarter Fiscal 2007 total revenues increased $41 million or 18% from first quarter Fiscal 2007 total revenues of $230 million.
During second quarter Fiscal 2007, the Company repurchased 441,000 shares of common stock for approximately $18 million. Since the inception of the program in April 1999, the Company has repurchased 7.4 million shares of common stock for approximately $315 million of consideration. The funding of this program has been provided primarily through the Company's free cash flow generation.
Second quarter Fiscal 2007 cash provided by operating activities was $9 million or 70% of net income, compared to $12 million or 91% of net income for the same quarter last year. Second quarter Fiscal 2007 free cash flow (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) was $12 million compared to $18 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, first quarter Fiscal 2007 cash provided by operating activities was $13 million or 161% of net income and free cash flow was $14 million. Black Box utilized its second quarter Fiscal 2007 free cash flow to repurchase $11 million of its common stock and pay dividends of $1 million. Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company.
For the six month period ending September 30, 2006, diluted earnings per share were $1.18 on net income of $20.9 million or 4.2% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.17 on net income of $20.2 million or 5.5% of revenues for the same period last year. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share for the six month period ending September 30, 2006 were $1.50 on operating net income of $26.6 million or 5.3% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of $1.53 on operating net income of $26.3 million or 7.2% of revenues for the same period last year.

For the six month period ending September 30, 2006, the Company's reconciling items included pre-tax charges of $3.3 million for amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, $3.2 million for stock-based compensation expense, $1.2 million for asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions, and $1.1 million for restructuring charges / severance costs. The impact of these reconciling items after tax on net income and EPS is $5.7 million and 32, respectively. During the six month period ended October 1, 2005, as previously disclosed, the Company's reconciling items included pre-tax charges of $5.3 million for restructuring charges / severance costs, $2.2 million for amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, and $1.9 million for asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions. The impact of these reconciling items after tax on net income and EPS is $6.2 million and 36, respectively. See below for further discussion regarding Management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements.
For the six month period ending September 30, 2006, total revenues were $502 million, an increase of $138 million or 38% from $364 million for the same period last year.
Cash provided by operating activities for the six month period was $22 million or 104% of net income compared to $22 million or 111% of net income for the same period last year. Free cash flow was $26 million compared to $29 million for the same period last year. Black Box utilized its six month period free cash flow to fund mergers and acquisitions of $13 million, repurchase $11 million of its common stock, and pay dividends of $2 million.
The Company's 6-month order backlog was $165 million at September 30, 2006 compared to $104 million for the same quarter ended last year. On a sequential quarter end comparison basis, the Company's 6-month order backlog was $168 million at July 1, 2006.
"We are pleased to report consecutive quarters of record revenues and now record operating earnings per share," stated Fred C. Young, Chief Executive Officer of Black Box Corporation. "These two significant milestones were accomplished through the combined efforts of our 4,600 Worldwide Black Box Team Members. With revenues now annualizing at $1 billion, we will look to build upon our first half success moving forward."

The Company provides non-GAAP ("adjusted financial measurements") such as free cash flow, operating net income, and operating earnings per share (EPS) as a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") regarding the Company's operational performance. These adjusted financial measurements exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided Management explanations regarding their use and the usefulness of adjusted financial measurements, definitions of the adjusted financial measurements, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures which are provided below.
Non-GAAP Financial Measurements
Management uses adjusted financial measurements (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability, and (e) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members. Moreover, the Company has historically reported these adjusted financial measurements as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While Management believes these adjusted financial measurements provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of adjusted financial measurements. The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors, and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude restructuring and severance related costs incurred during the periods reported that will impact future operating results, (iv) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash stock-based compensation charges, which is similar to cash compensation paid to employees and is an integral part of achieving our operating results, (v) the
 
Page 10
non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years which is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets, and (vi) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Adjusted financial measurements are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's adjusted financial measurements are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
Free Cash Flow
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be included with cash provided by operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures are typically material and directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.
Net capital expenditures
The Company believes that proceeds from stock option exercises should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the actual cash available to the Company. The Company has demonstrated a recurring inflow of cash related to its stock-based compensation plans and since this cash is immediately available to the Company, it directly impacts the availability of the Company's operating cash. The amount of proceeds from stock option exercises is dependent upon a number of variables, including
Proceeds from stock option exercises
 
Page 11
the number and exercise price of outstanding options and the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the timing of stock option exercises is under the control of the individual option holder and is not in the control of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of any proceeds from stock option exercises.
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to US dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive and / or negative impact of such charges as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in US dollars.
Foreign currency translation adjustment
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
Management believes that operating net income, defined as net income less reconciling items including restructuring charges / severance costs, amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, stock-based compensation expense, and asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provides investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in a way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below:
Operating net income and operating earnings per share (EPS)
 
Page 12
The Company believes that incurring costs in the current period(s) as part of a formal restructuring plan or as a result of economies of scale from acquisitions will result in a long-term positive impact on financial performance in the future. Restructuring charges and non-restructuring severance costs are presented in accordance with GAAP in our Condensed Statements of Income. However, due to the material amount of additional costs incurred during a single or possibly two successive periods, Management believes that exclusion of these costs and their related tax impact provides a more accurate reflection of the Company's ongoing financial performance.
Restructuring charges / severance costs
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123(R)") as of April 1, 2006, the first day of the Company's Fiscal 2007, using the modified prospective transition method. This transition method requires non-cash compensation expense to be recognized for all share-based payments granted after the date of adoption and for all unvested awards existing on the date of adoption. Stock-based compensation expense is now an integral part of ongoing operations since it is considered similar to other types of compensation to employees. However, Management believes that the application of the modified prospective transition method may result in misleading period-over-period comparisons during the transition year of Fiscal 2007 and is providing an adjusted disclosure, which excludes stock-based compensation and its related tax impact in the current period.
Stock-based compensation expense
 
Page 13
The Company incurs non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years. Specifically, this non-cash expenditure is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets. Asset write-ups are depreciated over their remaining useful life which generally falls between one to five years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed from acquisition to the end of the assets useful life, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.

Item 8.01 Other Events.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, February 1, 2007  Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ: BBOX) reported today on the independent review of past stock option grant practices currently being undertaken under the direction of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, with the assistance of outside legal counsel.
As disclosed on November 16, 2006, the Company received an informal inquiry from the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regarding the Company's stock option practices during the period 1997 to the present and reported that it intended to cooperate fully with the SEC's inquiry. In connection with its full cooperation with the SEC's informal inquiry, the Company and such outside legal counsel have been reviewing all stock option grants previously issued by the Company.
The Audit Committee has been regularly apprised of the status of the ongoing investigation of the Company's historical stock option grant practices and the related accounting for stock option grants. That investigation currently includes all stock option grants since 1992, including an examination of option grants that could affect the historical financial statements for all of the fiscal years and fiscal quarters contained in the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 and its Forms 10-Q for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2007. At this time, the Audit Committee has not completed its assessment, and its review of such practices is continuing.
Although the investigation is ongoing, the Company believes that it will need to record additional non-cash charges for stock-based compensation expense relating to certain stock option grants. The Company has not yet determined the aggregate amount of such expense or the periods in which such expense would be recorded. Accordingly, the Company has not yet determined whether it will need to restate its financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 and prior years. Further, the Company has not determined, in the event of any such restatement, which historical financial statements may need to be restated, the magnitude of any such restatement or the tax impact that may result. The Company currently expects, however, that any such restatement would not have a material impact on Fiscal 2007 earnings.
Consequently, the Company is expressing caution with respect to investors' ability to rely on its historical financial statements until the Company can determine with certainty whether a restatement will be required and, if so, the extent of any such restatement and the periods affected. Under these circumstances, the Company believes that it may not be in a position to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 on a timely basis pending the completion of the investigation.
 
The Company currently expects to release financial information regarding its third quarter Fiscal 2007 on Monday, February 12, 2007. The Company plans to issue a press release announcing such information after the close of the market. A conference call will follow at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, hosted by Fred C. Young, Chief Executive Officer of Black Box Corporation.
Investors may access the teleconference call by dialing 612-332-1025 approximately 15 minutes prior to the starting time and asking to be connected to the Black Box Earnings Call. A replay of the conference call will be available for one week after the teleconference by dialing 320-365-3844 and using access code 862344.
Any forward-looking statements contained in this release are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the fact they use words such as "should," "anticipate," "estimate," "approximate," "expect," "target," "may," "will," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe" and other words of similar meaning and expression. One can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors, they may include the timing of the completion and results of the independent review of the Company's stock option grant practices by the Audit Committee. We can give no assurance that any goal, plan, date or target set forth in forward-looking statements can be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of future events or developments.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, February 12, 2007  Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported preliminary results for the third quarter Fiscal 2007 ended December 30, 2006. The financial information included in this press release is preliminary and subject to change as described in "Review of Stock Option Practices" below. For the third quarter Fiscal 2007, diluted earnings per share were 59 on net income of $10.6 million or 4.0% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of 70 on net income of $12.5 million or 6.9% of revenues for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, second quarter Fiscal 2007 diluted earnings per share were 74 on net income of $13.1 million or 4.8% of revenues. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) for third quarter Fiscal 2007 were 78 on operating net income (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) of $13.8 million or 5.2% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of 75 on operating net income of $13.3 million or 7.3% of revenues for the same quarter last year. Management believes that presenting operating earnings per share and operating net income excluding reconciling items is useful to investors because it provides a more meaningful comparison of the ongoing operations of the Company.
During third quarter Fiscal 2007, the Company's reconciling items included pre-tax charges of $2.6 million for amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, $1.6 million for stock-based compensation expense, and $0.7 million for asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions. The impact of these reconciling items after tax on net income and EPS is $3.2 million and 18, respectively. During third quarter Fiscal             
 
Page 2
2006, as previously disclosed, the Company's reconciling items included pre-tax charges of $1.1 million for amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions and $0.1 million for asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions. The impact of these reconciling items after tax on net income and EPS is $0.8 million and 5, respectively. See below for further discussion regarding management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements.
Third quarter Fiscal 2007 total revenues were $265 million, an increase of $83 million or 45% from $182 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, third quarter Fiscal 2007 total revenues decreased $7 million or 2% from second quarter Fiscal 2007 total revenues of $271 million.
During third quarter Fiscal 2007, the Company repurchased 60,000 shares of common stock for approximately $3 million. Since the inception of the program in April 1999, the Company has repurchased 7.4 million shares of common stock for approximately $318 million of consideration. The funding of this program has been provided primarily through the Company's free cash flow generation.
Third quarter Fiscal 2007 cash provided by operating activities was $3 million or 30% of net income, compared to $16 million or 131% of net income for the same quarter last year. Third quarter Fiscal 2007 free cash flow (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) was $7 million compared to $24 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, second quarter Fiscal 2007 cash provided by operating activities was $9 million or 70% of net income and free cash flow was $12 million. Black Box utilized its third quarter Fiscal 2007 free cash flow to fund mergers and acquisitions of $3 million, repurchase $3 million of its common stock, and pay dividends of $1 million. Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company.

For the nine-month period ended December 30, 2006, diluted earnings per share was $1.77 on net income of $31.5 million or 4.1% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.88 on net income of $32.7 million or 6.0% of revenues for the same period last year. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share for the nine-month period ended December 30, 2006 were $2.27 on operating net income of $40.4 million or 5.3% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of $2.28 on operating net income of $39.7 million or 7.3% of revenues for the same period last year.
For the nine-month period ended December 30, 2006, the Company's reconciling items included pre-tax charges of $5.9 million for amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, $4.8 million for stock-based compensation expense, $1.9 million for asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions, and $1.1 million for restructuring charges / severance costs. The impact of these reconciling items after tax on net income and EPS is $9.0 million and 50, respectively. During the nine-month period ended December 31, 2005, as previously disclosed, the Company's reconciling items included pre-tax charges of $5.3 million for restructuring charges / severance costs, $3.4 million for amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, and $2.0 million for asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions. The impact of these reconciling items after tax on net income and EPS is $7.0 million and 40, respectively. See below for further discussion regarding management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements.
For the nine-month period ended December 30, 2006, total revenues were $767 million, an increase of $220 million or 40% from $546 million for the same period last year.
Cash provided by operating activities for the nine-month period was $25 million or 78% of net income compared to $39 million or 119% of net income for the same period last year. Free cash flow was $33 million compared to $53 million for the same period last year. Black Box utilized its nine-month period free cash flow to fund mergers and acquisitions of $16 million, repurchase $14 million of its common stock, and pay dividends of $3 million.

The Company's 6-month order backlog was $162 million at December 30, 2006 compared to $94 million for the same quarter ended last year. On a sequential quarter end comparison basis, the Company's 6-month order backlog was $165 million at September 30, 2006.
For FY08, the Company is targeting total year reported revenues of approximately $1.0 billion; corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of $3.45 to $3.65; and cash provided by operating activities in the range of 80% to 90% of operating net income.
All of the above ranges exclude acquisition-related expense and stock option-based expense (including the impact of SFAS 123(R)), any restructuring and severance expenses related to the NextiraOne integration plan, and are before any new mergers and acquisition activity that has not been announced.
Commenting on the quarter and the FY08 outlook, Fred C. Young, Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are very pleased to report revenues of $265 million for our December quarter. This level of revenues represents 45% growth over last year's $182 million. It also represents the second highest quarterly revenues we have ever reported. In addition, our nine-month revenues have grown 40%, setting a new record at $767 million. We have generated more revenues in nine months this year than we did for our entire previous fiscal year ($721 million). This type of significant growth and associated increase in market share are what we have been and continue to be focused on."
Mr. Young went on to say, "With Black Box now at the $1.0 billion level of revenues, we are tuning our associated cost structure accordingly. To this end, we are making good progress with the NextiraOne integration. Our goal is to finish the bulk of this integration within the next 6 to 9 months. The contributing results of this integration program are consistent with our goal to achieve our operating earnings per share and cash flow targets for FY08, which starts in April."
The Company will conduct a conference call beginning at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time today, February 12, 2007. Fred C. Young, Chief Executive Officer, will host the call. To participate in the call, please dial 612-332-1025 approximately 15 minutes prior to the starting time and ask to be connected to the Black Box Earnings Call. A replay of the conference call will be available for one week after the teleconference by dialing 320-365-3844 and using access code 862344.

Review of Stock Option Practices
As previously announced, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, is conducting an independent review of the Company's historical stock option grant practices and related accounting for stock option grants. At this time, the Audit Committee has not completed its assessment, and its review of such practices is continuing. That investigation currently includes all stock option grants since 1992, including an examination of option grants that could affect the historical financial statements for all of the fiscal years and fiscal quarters contained in the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 and its Forms 10-Q for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2007.
Although the Audit Committee's review is ongoing, the Company believes that it will need to record additional non-cash charges for stock-based compensation expense relating to certain stock option grants. The Company has not yet determined the aggregate amount of such expense or the periods in which such expense would be recorded. Accordingly, the Company has not yet determined whether it will need to restate its historical financial statements. Further, the Company has not determined, in the event of any such restatement, which historical financial statements may need to be restated, the magnitude of any such restatement, or the tax impact that may result. The preliminary results provided in this release do not include any such additional charges and are subject to adjustments based on the outcome of the review. The Company currently expects, however, that any such restatement would not have a material impact on Fiscal 2007 earnings.
As previously disclosed, the Company will delay the filing of its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 30, 2006. As soon as practical following the completion of the Audit Committee's review, the Company will file its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 30, 2006 and any necessary restatements and amended filings.
The Company continues to express caution with respect to investors' ability to rely on its historical financial statements until the Company can determine with certainty whether a restatement will be required and, if so, the extent of any such restatement and the periods affected.

Non-GAAP Financial Measurements
The Company provides non-GAAP ("adjusted financial measurements") such as free cash flow, cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments, operating net income, operating earnings per share (EPS), Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization ("EBITDA"), and Adjusted EBITDA, as a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") regarding the Company's operational performance. These adjusted financial measurements exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided Management explanations regarding their use and the usefulness of adjusted financial measurements, definitions of the adjusted financial measurements, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures which are provided below.
Management uses adjusted financial measurements (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability, and (e) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members. Moreover, the Company has historically reported these adjusted financial measurements as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While Management believes these adjusted financial measurements provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of adjusted financial measurements. The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors, and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude restructuring and severance related costs incurred during the periods reported that will impact future operating results, (iv) the non-GAAP    
 
Page 11
financial measures exclude non-cash stock-based compensation charges, which is similar to cash compensation paid to employees and is an integral part of achieving our operating results, (v) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years which is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets, and (vi) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Adjusted financial measurements are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's adjusted financial measurements are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
Net capital expenditures
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be included with cash provided by operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures are typically material and directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.
 
Page 12
Proceeds from stock option exercises
The Company believes that proceeds from stock option exercises should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the actual cash available to the Company. The Company has demonstrated a recurring inflow of cash related to its stock-based compensation plans and since this cash is immediately available to the Company, it directly impacts the availability of the Company's operating cash. The amount of proceeds from stock option exercises is dependent upon a number of variables, including the number and exercise price of outstanding options and the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the timing of stock option exercises is under the control of the individual option holder and is not in the control of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of any proceeds from stock option exercises.
Foreign currency translation adjustment
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to US dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive and / or negative impact of such charges as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in US dollars.
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
 
Page 13
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities plus restructuring payments. The Company believes that restructuring payments should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the cash flow from operations.
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is presented below:
Operating net income and operating earnings per share (EPS)
Management believes that operating net income, defined as net income less reconciling items including restructuring charges / severance costs, amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, stock-based compensation expense, and asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provides investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in a way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below:
Restructuring charges / severance costs
The Company believes that incurring costs in the current period(s) as part of a formal restructuring plan or as a result of economies of scale from acquisitions will result in a long-term positive impact on financial performance in the future. Restructuring charges and non-restructuring severance costs are presented in accordance with GAAP in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. However, due to the material amount of additional costs incurred during a single or possibly two successive periods, Management believes that exclusion of these costs and their related tax impact provides a more accurate reflection of the Company's ongoing financial performance.
 
Page 14
Amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Stock-based compensation expense
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123(R)") as of April 1, 2006, the first day of the Company's Fiscal 2007, using the modified prospective transition method. This transition method requires non-cash compensation expense to be recognized for all share-based payments granted after the date of adoption and for all unvested awards existing on the date of adoption. Stock-based compensation expense is now an integral part of ongoing operations since it is considered similar to other types of compensation to employees. However, Management believes that the application of the modified prospective transition method may result in misleading period-over-period comparisons during the transition year of Fiscal 2007 and is providing an adjusted disclosure, which excludes stock-based compensation and its related tax impact in the current period.
Asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions
The Company incurs non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years. Specifically, this non-cash expenditure is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets. Asset write-ups are depreciated over their remaining useful life which generally falls between one to five years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed from acquisition to the end of the asset's useful life, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.

A reconciliation of diluted earnings per common share (EPS) to operating EPS is presented below:
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
Management believes that EBITDA, defined as income before provision for income taxes plus interest, depreciation, and amortization, is a widely accepted measure of profitability that we believe may be used to measure our ability to service our debt. Adjusted EBITDA, defined as EBITDA plus stock compensation expense, may also be used to measure our ability to service our debt.
A reconciliation of net income to EBITDA is presented below:
Supplemental Information:
The following supplemental information including geographical segment results, service type results, same office comparisons, and significant balance sheet ratios and other information is being provided for comparisons of reported results for third quarter Fiscal 2007 and 2006, second quarter Fiscal 2007, and / or third quarter Fiscal 2007 and 2006 year-to-date.

Item 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
        On February 15, 2007, Black Box Corporation (the "Company") received a Staff Determination Letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market stating that the Company is not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) and, therefore, its common stock is subject to delisting. As anticipated, the letter was issued in accordance with Nasdaq procedures due to the previously disclosed delayed filing of the Company's Form 10-Q for its third quarter fiscal 2007 ended December 30, 2006.

Item 4.02 Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
     (a) As previously announced, the Audit Committee (the "Audit Committee") of the Board of Directors of Black Box Corporation (the "Company"), with the assistance of outside legal counsel, is conducting an independent review of the Company's historical stock option grant practices and related accounting for stock option grants during the period from 1992 to the present. On February 1, 2007, the Company announced that, while the review of option grant practices was continuing, it believed that it would need to record additional non-cash charges for stock-based compensation expense relating to certain stock option grants and, accordingly, cautioned investors about relying on its historical financial statements until the Company could determine with certainty whether a restatement would be required and, if so, the extent of any such restatement and the periods affected.
     Although the Audit Committee has not yet completed its review, the Audit Committee has concluded that the exercise price of certain stock option grants differed from the fair market value of the underlying shares on the appropriate measurement date. Although the review of option practices is ongoing, Company management and the Audit Committee currently expect that the Company's additional non-cash, pre-tax charges for stock-based compensation expense relating to certain stock option grants will approximate $63 million for the period under review. In addition, the Company and the Audit Committee have now concluded that the Company will need to restate its previously issued financial statements contained in reports previously filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). The Company continues to expect that any such restatement will not have a material impact on its earnings for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2007.
     Accordingly, on March 19, 2007, Company management and the Audit Committee concluded that the Company's previously issued financial statements and other historical financial information and related disclosures for the period under review, including applicable reports of its current or former independent registered public accounting firms and related press releases, should not be relied upon.
     The Company will prepare and file with the SEC, as soon as practical after completion of the ongoing review of option practices, any necessary reports or amendments to previous SEC filings as well as its Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2006.
     Company management and the Audit Committee have discussed the matters in this filing pursuant to Item 4.02(a) with BDO Seidman, LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.
     This Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements" under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including those that involve the risks, uncertainties and potential consequences relating to the findings of and any recommendations relating to the ongoing independent review by the Audit Committee regarding the Company's historical stock option grant practices, the restatement of the Company's financial statements, the filing of the delinquent report on Form 10-Q and the filing with the SEC of necessary restatements and amended filings. Any forward-looking statements contained in this release are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Item 5.02   Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
     (b) On May 20, 2007, Fred C. Young resigned as Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and President and as a member of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Black Box Corporation (the "Company").
     (c) On May 21, 2007, the Board named R. Terry Blakemore, 50, as interim President and CEO and created the Office of the Chairman to manage the Company consisting of Mr. Blakemore, Michael McAndrew, Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, Francis W. Wertheimber, Senior Vice President, and Thomas G. Greig, Chairman of the Board.
     Previously, on May 15, 2007, the Board had named Mr. Blakemore a Senior Vice President of the Company. Prior to becoming a Senior Vice President, Mr. Blakemore served as a manager of business development and, prior thereto, as a manager of the Company's voice services business unit. Mr. Blakemore has been with the Company since 1999.
     The Board approved the payment of a bonus of $75,000 to Mr. Blakemore in connection with his service as interim President and CEO.
     (c) and (e) On May 17, 2007 and May 18, 2007, respectively, Messrs. McAndrew and Blakemore, each of whom is an executive officer of the Company, executed separate, identical agreements with the Company. The agreements provide for severance payments to the executive officer upon termination of employment by the Company (other than due to death, disability, retirement or for cause) or by the executive officer for good reason, in each case within two (2) years following a change-in-control of the Company. The amount of severance obligation owed generally is an amount equal to two (2) times the executive's annual base salary and average incentive bonus received over the preceding three (3) years plus the amount that would be paid under any existing long-term incentive plan. In addition, if severance is owed, (i) all stock options held by the executive which did not immediately vest and/or become exercisable upon the occurrence of a change-in-control will vest and remain outstanding for their stated term and (ii) the executive will be entitled to continuation of medical and similar benefits for two (2) years. The agreements also contain provisions, binding upon the executive officer, relating to non-disclosure of the Company's proprietary information, assignment of intellectual property rights to the Company and non-competition with the Company for a period of five (5) years following termination of employment with the Company. The term of these agreements is five (5) years with an evergreen renewal on a one-year basis thereafter, absent notice of nonrenewal six (6) months prior to the renewal date. Copies of these agreements are filed as exhibits to this report.
     (e) On May 15, 2007, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board recommended that the Board approve, and the Board approved, the payment of a $100,000 bonus to Mr. Wertheimber based on the operating margin and days sales outstanding ("DSOs") performance of the business unit under his management.
     Also, on May 15, 2007, the Committee recommended that the Board adopt, and the Board adopted, an executive incentive bonus plan for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2008.
 
     The plan goals include reported operating earnings per share and DSOs. A bonus pool will be created based on reported operating earnings per share. Payout of the bonus pool will be based upon DSOs at fiscal year end with, on the low end, 75% of the pool payable upon achievement of approximately 90% of the DSOs target and, on the high end, 100% payout of the pool upon achievement of 100% of the DSOs target. In addition, payments may be made at the discretion of the Board. The following executive officers of the Company will participate in this plan: Messrs. Blakemore, McAndrew and Wertheimber. Non-executive personnel also will participate in this plan. The bonus pool, if paid out, will be shared equally by each individual in the plan.

During the term of the Executive's employment with the Corporation and, if the Corporation should then so request, after termination of such employment, the Executive agrees to assign and does hereby assign to the Corporation all rights in the Developments created by the Executive alone or with others during the term of the Executive's employment, and all rights in any trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets and analogous intellectual property rights and any applications for registration for same, of the United States and such foreign countries as the Corporation may designate which are related to the Developments, including without limitation all accompanying goodwill and the right to sue for infringement or misappropriation and to receive all proceeds related to any judgment or settlement of same. The Executive agrees to execute and deliver to the Corporation any instruments the Corporation deems necessary to vest in the Corporation sole title to and all exclusive rights in the Developments created by the Executive alone or with others during the term of the Executive's employment, and in all related trademarks, copyrights, mask work protection rights, and/or patent rights so created during the term of employment. The Executive agrees to execute and deliver to the Corporation all proper papers for use in applying for, obtaining, maintaining, amending and enforcing all such trademarks, copyrights, patents or such other legal protections as the Corporation may desire. The Executive further agrees to assist fully the Corporation or its nominees in the preparation and prosecution of any trademark, copyright, mask work protection, patent, or trade secret arbitration or litigation. The Executive shall be reimbursed on a reasonable hourly basis consistent with the compensation provided for herein for the Executive's services rendered following termination of employment.
 
 
 
any business which is competitive with any business of the Corporation or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof in which Executive is or was engaged; provided, however, that the foregoing provisions of this paragraph 8 are not intended to prohibit and shall not prohibit Executive from purchasing, for investment, not in excess of 1% of any class of stock or other corporate security of any company which is registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Executive acknowledges that the breach by the Executive of the provisions of this Section 8 would cause irreparable injury to the Corporation, acknowledges and agrees that remedies at law for any such breach will be inadequate and consents and agrees that the Corporation shall be entitled, without the necessity of proof of actual damage, to injunctive relief in any proceedings which may be brought to enforce the provisions of this Section 8. Executive acknowledges and warrants that the Executive will be fully able to earn an adequate livelihood for the Executive and the Executive's dependents if this Section 8 should be specifically enforced against the Executive and that such enforcement will not impair the Executive's ability to obtain employment commensurate with the Executive's abilities and fully acceptable to the Executive .
If the scope of any restriction contained in this Section 8 is too broad to permit enforcement of such restriction to its full extent, then such restriction shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law and Executive and the Corporation hereby consent and agree that such scope may be judicially modified in any proceeding brought to enforce such restriction.
 
 
(i) For purposes of this subsection 10(j), (1) a Payment shall mean any payment or distribution in the nature of compensation to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise; (2) Agreement Payment shall mean a Payment paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement (disregarding this subsection 10(j)); (2) Net After Tax Receipts shall mean the Present Value of a Payment net of all taxes imposed on the Executive with respect thereto under Sections 1 and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), determined by applying the highest marginal rate under Section 1 of the Code applicable to the Executive's taxable income for such year; (4) "Present Value" shall mean such value determined in accordance with Section 280G(d) (4) of the Code; and (5) "Reduced Amount" shall mean the greatest aggregate amount of Payments, if any, which (x) is less than the sum of all Payments and (y) results in aggregate Net After Tax Receipts which are greater than the Net After Tax Receipts which would result if the aggregate Payments were made.
 
(ii) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event PriceWaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. (or if PriceWaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. is the audit firm for the Corporation at the time, another accounting firm of nationally recognized standing selected by Executive) (the "Accounting Firm") shall determine that receipt of all Payments would subject the Executive to tax under Section 4999 of the Code, it shall determine whether some amount of Payments would meet the definition of a "Reduced Amount." If the Accounting Firm determines that there is a Reduced Amount, the aggregate Agreement Payments shall be reduced to such Reduced Amount; provided, however, that if the Reduced Amount exceeds the aggregate Agreement Payments, the aggregate Payments shall, after the reduction of all Agreement Payments, be reduced (but not below zero) in the amount of such excess. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section shall be binding upon the Corporation and the Executive and shall be made within 60 days of the occurrence of an event which requires the Corporation to make payments to the Executive under this Agreement. No later than two business days following the making of this determination by the Accounting Firm, the Corporation shall pay to or distribute for the benefit of the Executive such Payments as are then due to the Executive under this Agreement and shall promptly pay to or distribute for the benefit of the Executive in the future such Payments as become due to the Executive under this Agreement. The Corporation or its successor shall pay for the work done by the Accounting Firm. In the event that the Accounting Firm is unable or unwilling to make the determinations to be made under this subsection 10(j) or for any reason such determinations are not made within 60 days of the occurrence of the event which requires the Corporation to make payments to the Executive under this Agreement, the Corporation shall make all Payments as are then due to the Executive without reduction no later than two business days following the 60th day after the occurrence of the event which required the Corporation to make payments to the Executive under this Agreement.
(iii) While it is the intention of the Corporation and the Executive to reduce the amounts payable or distributable to the Executive hereunder only if the aggregate Net After Tax Receipts to the Executive would thereby be increased, as a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed by the Corporation to or for the benefit of the Executive pursuant to this Agreement which should not have been so paid or distributed ("Overpayments") or that additional amounts which will not have been paid or distributed by the Corporation to or for
 
the benefit of the Executive pursuant to this Agreement could have been so paid or distributed ("Underpayment"), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based either upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against the Corporation or the Executive which the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success or controlling precedent or other substantial authority, determines that an Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment paid or distributed by the Corporation to or for the benefit of the Executive shall be treated for all purposes as a loan ab initio to the Executive which the Executive shall repay to the Corporation together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f) (2) of the Code; provided, however, that no such loan shall be deemed to have been made and no amount shall be payable by the Executive to the Corporation if and to the extent such deemed loan and payment would not either reduce the amount on which the Executive is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or other substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Corporation to or for the benefit of the Executive together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f) (2) of the Code.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, June 14, 2007  Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ GSM: BBOX) today reported that, on June 8, 2007, it received an additional notice of non-compliance from the Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market ("NASDAQ"), stating that the Company is not in compliance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) and, therefore, its common stock is subject to delisting, due to the delay in filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 (the "Form 10-K").
As previously announced on February 20, 2007, the Company received an initial NASDAQ notice of non-compliance regarding the delay in filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2006 (the "Form 10-Q"). The Form 10-Q and Form 10-K filing delays are the result of the previously-announced review of the Company's historical stock option grant practices being undertaken by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company with the assistance of outside legal counsel, as well as the delay in the completion of the audit of the Company's financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 as a result of these matters.
In response to the initial notice of non-compliance, the Company requested a hearing before a NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel (the "Panel"). Following the hearing, the Panel granted the Company's request for continued listing, subject to certain requirements, including: (1) on or before June 20, 2007, the Company must file the Form 10-Q as well as any required restatements; and (2) the Company must provide NASDAQ with additional information regarding the Company's independent review of its historical stock option practices and related accounting.
 
Page 2
The Company has provided NASDAQ with the additional information regarding the Company's independent review of its historical stock option practices and related accounting. On June 12, 2007, the Company requested that the Panel grant an extension through July 23, 2007 with respect to the filing of the Form 10-Q and any required restatements. This request also applies to the filing of the Form 10-K.
As soon as practical following the completion of the Audit Committee's review and completion of the audit of the Company's financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, the Company will file its Form 10-Q, any necessary restatements and amended filings and its Form 10-K. At the present time, the Company expects to be able to comply with the Panel's conditions for continued listing of the Company's securities as modified by the request.
Bank Waiver
Black Box also announced that, by letter dated June 11, 2007, Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania, as Agent, and the banks under the Company's senior credit agreement granted a waiver regarding the delivery of the Company's consolidated financial statements and related compliance certificates for the fiscal third quarter ended December 30, 2006 and fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, as well as the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") of its Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, respectively, for such periods. The waiver extends through July 31, 2007.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, June 28, 2007 -- Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported preliminary results for the fourth quarter Fiscal 2007 ended March 31, 2007. The financial information included in this press release is preliminary and subject to change as described in "Review of Stock Option Practices" below.
For the fourth quarter Fiscal 2007, diluted earnings per share were 39 on net income of $7.0 million or 2.8% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of 26 on net income of $4.7 million or 2.7% of revenues for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, third quarter Fiscal 2007 diluted earnings per share were 60 on net income of $10.6 million or 4.0% of revenues. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) for fourth quarter Fiscal 2007 were 71 on operating net income (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) of $12.5 million or 5.0% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of 53 on operating net income of $9.6 million or 5.5% of revenues for the same quarter last year. Management believes that presenting operating earnings per share and operating net income is useful to investors because it provides a more meaningful comparison of the ongoing operations of the Company.
During fourth quarter Fiscal 2007, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $8.5 million with an after tax impact on net income and EPS of $5.5 million and 31, respectively. During fourth quarter Fiscal 2006, as previously disclosed, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $7.5 million with an after tax impact on net income and EPS of $4.9 million and 27, respectively. See below for further discussion regarding management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements and a detailed presentation of the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the periods presented above.
Fourth quarter Fiscal 2007 total revenues were $250 million, an increase of $75 million or 43% from $175 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, third quarter Fiscal 2007 total revenues were $265 million.
Fourth quarter Fiscal 2007 cash provided by operating activities was $12 million or 173% of net income, compared to $13 million or 277% of net income for the same quarter last year. Fourth quarter Fiscal 2007 free cash flow (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) was $13 million compared to $19 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, third quarter Fiscal 2007 cash provided by operating activities was $3 million or 27% of net income and free cash flow was $7 million. Black Box utilized its fourth quarter Fiscal 2007 free cash flow to fund debt reduction of $12 million and pay

dividends of $1 million. Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company.
Fiscal 2007 diluted earnings per share were $2.11 on net income of $37.6 million or 3.7% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of $2.13 on net income of $37.4 million or 5.2% of revenues for the same period last year. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share for Fiscal 2007 were $2.97 on operating net income of $52.9 million or 5.2% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of $2.81 on operating net income of $49.3 million or 6.8% of revenues for the same period last year.
During Fiscal 2007, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $23.6 million with an after tax impact on net income and EPS of $15.3 million and 86, respectively. During Fiscal 2006, as previously disclosed, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $18.2 million with an after tax impact on net income and EPS of $11.9 million and 68, respectively. See below for further discussion regarding management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements and a detailed presentation of the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the periods presented above.
Fiscal 2007 total revenues were $1.0 billion, an increase of $295 million or 41% from $721 million for the same period last year.
Fiscal 2007 cash provided by operating activities was $37 million or 97% of net income compared to $52 million or 139% of net income for the same period last year. Free cash flow was $46 million compared to $72 million for the same period last year. Black Box utilized its Fiscal 2007 free cash flow to fund mergers and acquisitions of $16 million, repurchase $14 million of its common stock, fund debt reduction of $12 million, and pay dividends of $4 million.
The Company's 6-month order backlog was $159 million at March 31, 2007 compared to $96 million for the same quarter ended last year. On a sequential quarter end comparison basis, the Company's 6-month order backlog was $162 million at December 30, 2006.
For Fiscal 2008, the Company continues to target total year reported revenues of approximately $1.0 billion; corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of $3.45 to $3.65; and cash provided by operating activities in the range of 80% to 90% of operating net income.
All of the above ranges exclude acquisition-related expense, stock option-based expense (including the impact of SFAS 123(R)), any restructuring / severance / other costs related to the NextiraOne integration plan, the impact of changes in the fair market value of the Company's interest rate swap, and are before any new mergers and acquisition activity that has not been announced.
Commenting on FY07 and the FY08 outlook, Terry Blakemore, Interim President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We have achieved many significant accomplishments in FY07. We are especially pleased with achieving our target of a record $1 billion in revenues for the year, effectively doubling our business from FY05. This accomplishment significantly strengthens our market position while expanding the resources available to our worldwide client base who continue to receive the highest DVH service levels in the industry. We continue to believe that the Black Box technical service model provides the best value proposition to our clients."

Review of Stock Option Practices On November 13, 2006, Black Box received a letter of informal inquiry from the Enforcement Division of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") relating to the Company's stock option practices from January 1, 1997 to present. As a result, the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Audit Committee"), with the assistance of outside legal counsel, commenced an independent review of the Company's historical stock option grant practices and related accounting for stock option grants during the period from 1992 to the present (the "Review Period").
On February 1, 2007, the Company announced that, while the review of option grant practices was continuing, it believed that it would need to record additional non-cash charges for stock-based compensation expense relating to certain stock option grants and, accordingly, cautioned investors about relying on its historical financial statements until the Company could determine with certainty whether a restatement would be required and, if so, the extent of any such restatement and the periods affected.
On March 19, 2007, although the Audit Committee had not yet completed its review, the Audit Committee concluded that the exercise price of certain stock option grants differed from the fair market value of the underlying shares on the appropriate measurement date. At that time, the Company and the Audit Committee announced that it was currently expected that the Company's additional non-cash, pre-tax charges for stock-based compensation expense relating to certain stock option grants would approximate $63 million for the Review Period. In addition, the Company and the Audit Committee concluded that the Company would need to restate its previously-issued financial statements contained in reports previously filed by the Company with the SEC. Accordingly, on March 20, 2007, the Company and the Audit Committee announced that the Company's previously-issued financial statements and other historical financial information and related disclosures for the Review Period, including applicable reports of its current or former independent registered public accounting firms and related press releases, should not be relied upon.
On May 25, 2007, the Company was advised by the Enforcement Division of the SEC that a Formal Order of Private Investigation arising out of the Company's stock option practices had been entered and on May 29, 2007 the Company received a subpoena that was issued by the SEC.
On May 31, 2007, the Company announced that, as a result of the ongoing review of stock option practices, the Company and the Audit Committee expected that the Company's additional non-cash, pre-tax charges for stock-based compensation expense relating to certain stock option grants would approximate $70 million for the Review Period.
The preliminary results for Fiscal 2007 and the projections for Fiscal 2008 provided in this release do not include any such additional charges and are subject to adjustments based on the final outcome of the ongoing review and the impact, including but not limited to any tax impact, of any actions that may be required or taken as a result of such review.

The Company will prepare and file with the SEC, as soon as practical after completion of the ongoing review of option practices, any necessary reports or amendments to previous SEC filings as well as its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 30, 2006 and its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007.

As a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures such as free cash flow, cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments, operating net income, operating earnings per share (EPS), Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization ("EBITDA"), and Adjusted EBITDA to illustrate the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided Management explanations regarding their use and the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures which are provided below.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability, and (e) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members. Moreover, the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors, and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude restructuring, severance, and other acquisition integration costs incurred during the periods reported that will impact future operating results, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (iv) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash stock-based compensation charges, which is similar to cash compensation paid to employees and is an integral part of achieving our operating results, (v) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years which is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets, (vi) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude historical stock option granting practice investigation costs, (vii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash change in fair value of the interest rate swap which will continue to impact the Company's earnings until the interest rate swap is settled, (viii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the Italian Operations Adjustment which was a fourth quarter Fiscal 2006 adjustment that Management believes was an isolated charge for fourth quarter Fiscal 2006 (the "Italian Operations Adjustment"), and (ix) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
Free Cash Flow
 
Page 9
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be included with cash provided by operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures are typically material and directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.
Net capital expenditures
The Company believes that proceeds from stock option exercises should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the actual cash available to the Company. The Company has demonstrated a recurring inflow of cash related to its stock-based compensation plans and since this cash is immediately available to the Company, it directly impacts the availability of the Company's operating cash. The amount of proceeds from stock option exercises is dependent upon a number of variables, including the number and exercise price of outstanding options and the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the timing of stock option exercises is under the control of the individual option holder and is not in the control of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of any proceeds from stock option exercises.
Proceeds from stock option exercises
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to US dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive and / or negative impact of such charges as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in US dollars.
Foreign currency translation adjustment
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities plus restructuring payments. Restructuring payments are the cash payments made during the period for restructuring charges. The Company believes that restructuring payments should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the cash flow from operations.
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments
 
Page 10
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is presented below:
Management believes that operating net income, defined as net income less reconciling items including restructuring charges / severance costs, amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, stock-based compensation expense, asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions, acquisition integration costs, historical stock option granting practice investigation costs, the change in fair value of the interest rate swap, and the Italian Operations Adjustment and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provides investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in a way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below:
Operating net income and operating earnings per share (EPS)
The Company believes that incurring costs in the current period(s) as part of a formal restructuring plan or as a result of economies of scale from acquisitions will result in a long-term positive impact on financial performance in the future. Restructuring charges, non-restructuring severance costs, and other acquisition integration costs are presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. However, due to the material amount of additional costs incurred during a single or possibly successive periods, Management believes that exclusion of these costs and their related tax impact provides a more accurate reflection of the Company's ongoing financial performance.
Restructuring charges / severance costs / other acquisition integration costs
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123(R)") as of April 1, 2006, the first day of the Company's Fiscal 2007, using the modified prospective transition method. This transition method requires non-cash compensation expense to be recognized for all share-based payments granted after the date of adoption and for all unvested awards existing on the date of adoption. Stock-based compensation expense is now an integral part of ongoing operations since it is considered similar to other types of compensation to employees. However, Management believes that the application of the modified prospective transition method may result in misleading period-over-period comparisons during the transition year of Fiscal 2007 and is providing an adjusted disclosure, which excludes stock-based compensation and its related tax impact in the current period.
Stock-based compensation expense
 
Page 11
The Company incurs non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years. Specifically, this non-cash expenditure is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets. Asset write-ups are depreciated over their remaining useful life which generally falls between one to five years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed from acquisition to the end of the asset's useful life, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions
The Company incurred significant costs in connection with its investigation of historical stock option grant practices during the current year. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Historical stock option granting practices investigation costs
To mitigate the risk of interest-rate fluctuations associated with the Company's variable rate debt, the Company implemented an interest-rate risk management strategy that incorporated the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings caused by interest-rate volatility. During second quarter Fiscal 2007, the Company entered into a five-year interest rate swap ("interest rate swap") designated as a cash flow hedge which has been used to effectively convert a portion of the Company's variable rate debt to fixed rate. Changes in fair value of the interest rate swap were recorded as an asset/liability with the offset to other comprehensive income.
Change in fair value of the interest rate swap
During its year-end closing procedures, the Company re-evaluated its previous designation of the interest rate swap and determined that the interest rate swap did not qualify as a cash flow hedge because certain documentation requirements at the inception of the transaction were not explicitly met. While the change in designation does require the Company to recognize the changes in fair value of the interest rate swap as an asset/liability with the offset to interest expense (income), the interest rate swap remains highly effective. Management excludes this non-cash expense (income) and the related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
During the fourth quarter Fiscal 2006, the Company incurred a significant charge for an adjustment of earnings spanning multiple years, from Fiscal 2003 through Fiscal 2006, from the Company's Italian operations. The Italian Operations Adjustment resulted from intentional misconduct by certain local operational and financial managers of the Company's Italian operations acting in collusion with one another for the purpose of overstating local financial results. All involved team members have been terminated and the Company continues to pursue all available legal remedies against these individuals. The misconduct was brought to the Company management's attention by a team member of the Italian operations pursuant to the Company's "Open Door" Policy. Company management responded by immediately suspending the management team of the Italian operations and conducting a full investigation of the matter. The Company believes that all accounting irregularities have been identified, corrective action taken, and that the Italian Operations Adjustment captures all necessary corrections. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management.

Management believes that EBITDA, defined as income before provision for income taxes plus interest, depreciation, and amortization, is a widely accepted measure of profitability that we believe may be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Adjusted EBITDA, defined as EBITDA plus stock compensation expense, may also be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt.

     In addition, Black Box reported that it has received a letter, dated July 19, 2007, stating that the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel responsible for this matter (the "Panel") had granted the Company's request for continued listing of its common stock, subject to the Company filing, on or before August 13, 2007, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 and any required restatements (the "Form 10-K").
     The Company further reported that it was informed, by letter dated July 23, 2007, that the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council (the "Listing Council") had, on its own motion pursuant to its discretionary authority, called for review the decision of the Panel set forth in the July 19, 2007 letter discussed above. The Listing Council's letter further states that the Listing Council has determined to stay any delisting of the Company's common stock at this time pending further action by the Listing Council. The Company's submission to the Listing Council is due on or before September 28, 2007.
     Notwithstanding the Listing Council's stay of delisting, the Company expects to file its Form 10-K on or about August 13, 2007, although the timing of such filing is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the timing and final outcome of the ongoing review of the Company's stock option practices and the related Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, as well as the timing and completion of the audit of the Company's financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007.

PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, August 14, 2007 -- Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported results for the first quarter of Fiscal 2008 ended June 30, 2007.
For the first quarter of Fiscal 2008, diluted earnings per share were 46 on net income of $8.2 million or 3.2% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of 37 on net income of $6.8 million or 3.0% of revenues for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 diluted earnings per share were 37 on net income of $6.6 million or 2.7% of revenues. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) for first quarter of Fiscal 2008 were 73 on operating net income (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) of $13.0 million or 5.1% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of 58 on operating net income of $10.6 million or 4.6% of revenues for the same quarter last year. Management believes that presenting operating earnings per share and operating net income is useful to investors because it provides a more meaningful comparison of the ongoing operations of the Company.
During the first quarter of Fiscal 2008, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $7.4 million with an after tax impact on net income and EPS of $4.7 million and 27, respectively. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2007, as previously disclosed, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $5.8 million with an after tax impact on net income and EPS of $3.8 million and 21, respectively. See below for further discussion regarding management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements and a detailed presentation of the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the periods presented above.
First quarter of Fiscal 2008 total revenues were $252 million, an increase of $22 million or 10% from $230 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 total revenues were $250 million.
First quarter of Fiscal 2008 cash provided by operating activities was $8 million or 94% of net income, compared to $13 million or 185% of net income for the same quarter last year. First quarter of Fiscal 2008 free cash flow (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) was $7 million compared to $14 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 cash provided by operating activities was $12 million or 182% of net income and free cash flow was $13 million. Black Box utilized its first quarter of Fiscal 2008 free cash flow to fund debt reduction of $3 million, to fund payments due on prior period acquisition activity of $3 million and to pay dividends of $1 million. Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company.
The Company's 6-month order backlog was $165 million at June 30, 2007 compared to $168 million for the same quarter ended last year. On a sequential quarter end comparison basis, the Company's 6-month order backlog was $159 million at March 31, 2007.
The Company has received notification that its distribution agreement with Avaya, Inc. will be terminated effective September 8, 2007. The Company is in discussions with Avaya concerning the future business relationship of the parties and the handling of key accounts. The Company continues to evaluate the potential financial impact of this event as well as potential business strategies to minimize such impact. The Company currently anticipates that this event will not have a material impact on its Fiscal 2008 operating results.
As a result of the pending termination of its distribution agreement with Avaya, Inc. and an increase in the Company's current effective tax rate from Fiscal 2007, the Company's current targets for Fiscal 2008 are reported revenues of approximately $1.0 billion; corresponding

operating earnings per share in the range of $3.30 to $3.50; and cash provided by operating activities in the range of 80% to 90% of operating net income.
All of the above ranges exclude acquisition-related expense, stock option-based expense (including the impact of SFAS 123(R)), any restructuring / severance / other costs related to the NextiraOne, LLC ("NextiraOne") integration plan and the impact of changes in the fair market value of the Company's interest rate swap, and are before any new mergers and acquisition activity that has not been announced.
Commenting on the first quarter results, Terry Blakemore, Interim President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are very pleased with our 1Q08 performance. Revenues, operating EPS and operating cash flow results achieved are consistent with our targeted ranges. We are particularly pleased with our overall organic growth of 6% as well as the positive organic growth reported in each of our geographic segments and service lines. We believe these results are attributable to the continued success in marketing our DVH (Data, Voice and Hotline) technical services coupled with stable end-user markets."

Mr. Blakemore went on to say, "In addition, significant progress continues to be made towards finalizing the integration efforts related to the NextiraOne acquisition. To that end, in 1Q08, we incurred approximately $4 million in expenses primarily related to systems integration, severance and facility consolidation. We expect that these actions will reduce our ongoing operating costs by approximately $2 million per quarter and are an important step in increasing both profitability and cash flow consistent with our FY08 objectives."
"In summary, our expectations for Black Box in FY08 remain high and are centered around continuing to deliver the highest quality technical DVH services to our clients around the world."

As a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures such as free cash flow, cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments, operating net income, operating earnings per share (EPS), Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") and Adjusted EBITDA to illustrate the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided Management explanations regarding their use and the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures which are provided below.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and (e) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members. Moreover, the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude restructuring, severance and other acquisition integration costs (collectively referred to as "restructuring charges" or "restructuring payments") incurred during the periods reported that will impact future operating results, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (iv) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash stock-based compensation charges, which is similar to cash compensation paid to employees and is an integral part of achieving our operating results, (v) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years which is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets, (vi) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude historical stock option granting practice investigation costs, (vii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash change in fair value of the interest rate swap which will continue to impact the Company's earnings until the interest rate swap is settled and (viii) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
Free Cash Flow
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be included with cash provided by operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures are typically material and directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.
Net capital expenditures
The Company believes that proceeds from stock option exercises should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the actual cash available to the Company. The Company has demonstrated a recurring inflow of cash related to its stock-based compensation plans and since this cash is immediately available to the Company, it directly impacts the availability of the Company's operating cash. The amount of proceeds from stock option exercises is dependent upon a number of variables, including the number and exercise price of outstanding options and the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the timing of stock option exercises is under the control of the individual option holder and is not in the control of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of any proceeds from stock option exercises.
Proceeds from stock option exercises
 
Page 7
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to U.S. dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive and / or negative impact of such charges as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in U.S. dollars.
Foreign currency translation adjustment
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities plus restructuring payments. Restructuring payments are the cash payments made during the period for restructuring charges. The Company believes that restructuring payments should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the cash flow from operations.
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is presented below:
Management believes that operating net income, defined as net income less reconciling items including restructuring charges, amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, stock-based compensation expense, asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions and the change in fair value of the interest rate swap and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provides investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in a way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below:
Operating net income and operating earnings per share (EPS)
The Company believes that incurring costs in the current period(s) as part of a restructuring plan or as a result of economies of scale from acquisitions will result in a long-term positive impact on financial performance in the future. Restructuring charges are presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. However, due to the material amount of additional costs incurred during a single or possibly successive periods, Management believes that exclusion of these costs and their related tax impact provides a more accurate reflection of the Company's ongoing financial performance.
Restructuring charges
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions
 
Page 8
The Company records non-cash stock-based compensation expense equal to the fair value of share-based payment awards to its directors, executives and employees. Stock-based compensation expense is an integral part of ongoing operations since it is considered similar to other types of compensation to employees. However, Management believes that varying levels of stock-based compensation expense could result in misleading period-over-period comparisons and is providing an adjusted disclosure, which excludes stock-based compensation and its related tax impact.
Stock-based compensation expense
The Company incurs non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years. Specifically, this non-cash expenditure is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets. Asset write-ups are depreciated over their remaining useful life which generally falls between one to five years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed from acquisition to the end of the asset's useful life, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions
The Company incurred significant costs in connection with its investigation of historical stock option grant practices during the current year. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Historical stock option granting practices investigation costs
To mitigate the risk of interest-rate fluctuations associated with the Company's variable rate debt, the Company entered into a five-year interest rate swap ("interest rate swap") that does not qualify as a cash flow hedge. Thus, the Company records the change in fair value of the interest rate swap as an asset/liability within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with the offset to Interest expense (income) within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Management excludes this non-cash expense (income) and the related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Change in fair value of the interest rate swap

A reconciliation of diluted earnings per common share (EPS) to operating EPS (may not sum due to rounding) is presented below:
Management believes that EBITDA, defined as income before provision for income taxes plus interest, depreciation and amortization, is a widely accepted measure of profitability that we believe may be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Adjusted EBITDA, defined as EBITDA plus stock compensation expense, may also be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt.

Item 5.02    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
     (c) On October 13, 2007, R. Terry Blakemore, 50, was named the President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") of Black Box Corporation (the "Company").
     Previously, on May 21, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") had named Mr. Blakemore the interim President and CEO. Prior thereto, Mr. Blakemore served as a Senior Vice President of the Company, a manager of business development and a manager of the Company's voice services business unit. Mr. Blakemore has been with the Company since 1999.
     The Board, upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee of the Board, approved a base salary for Mr. Blakemore of $500,000 and the payment of a bonus of $75,000 in connection with his appointment as President and CEO.
     (c) and (e) On October 16, 2007, Mr. Blakemore and the Company executed an agreement with the Company that amends and restates the previous agreement between the parties dated as of May 15, 2007.
     The new agreement provides for severance payments to Mr. Blakemore upon termination of employment by the Company (other than due to death, disability, retirement or for cause) or by Mr. Blakemore for good reason (, a material diminution in base compensation, authority, duties or responsibilities) prior to a change-in-control of the Company. The severance owed in this case is a lump sum payment of not less than twelve (12) months' base salary and not more than the amount of base salary remaining to be paid to Mr. Blakemore to the third anniversary of the date of the agreement.
i.e.
     As with the prior agreement, the new agreement provides for severance payments to Mr. Blakemore upon termination of employment by the Company (other than due to death, disability, retirement or for cause) or by Mr. Blakemore for good reason (, a material diminution in base compensation, authority, duties or responsibilities or a relocation), in each case within two (2) years following a change-in-control of the Company. The amount of severance obligation owed in this case generally is an amount equal to three (3) times Mr. Blakemore's annual base salary and average incentive bonus received over the preceding three (3) years plus the amount that would be paid under any existing long-term incentive plan. In addition, if severance is owed under the scenario described in this paragraph, (i) all stock options held by the executive which did not immediately vest and/or become exercisable upon the occurrence of a change-in-control will vest and remain outstanding for their stated term, not to exceed ten (10) years and (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable law and the medical insurance and benefits policies to which Mr. Blakemore is entitled to participate, the Company will maintain Mr. Blakemore's paid coverage for health insurance (through the payment of Mr. Blakemore's insurance premiums) generally for eighteen (18) months. Such payments are not required to be "grossed up" for the effect of any excise taxes that might be due under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.
i.e.
     The agreement also contains provisions relating to non-disclosure of the Company's proprietary information, assignment of intellectual property rights to the Company and non-competition with the Company for a period of five (5) years following termination of employment

with the Company. The term of the agreement is five (5) years with an evergreen renewal on a one-year basis thereafter, absent notice of non-renewal six (6) months prior to the renewal date. A copy of this agreement is filed as an exhibit to this report.
     (d) Effective October 13, 2007, Mr. Blakemore was elected to the Board.

(1) the total cash award or bonus which would have been received by the Executive under such LTIP Plan assuming that, in addition to any goals met on or before the date of the Change-in-Control, all goals that were to be measured after the date of the Change-in-Control were achieved and the Executive remained in the employ of the Corporation at all relevant times under the LTIP Plan,
less
 
(2) any portion of the cash award or bonus for that award period previously paid to the Executive pursuant to such LTIP Plan.

During the term of the Executive's employment with the Corporation and, if the Corporation should then so request, after termination of such employment, the Executive agrees to assign and does hereby assign to the Corporation all rights in the Developments created by the Executive alone or with others during the term of the Executive's employment, and all rights in any trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets and analogous intellectual property rights and any applications for registration for same, of the United States and such foreign countries as the Corporation may designate which are related to the Developments, including without limitation all accompanying goodwill and the right to sue for infringement or misappropriation and to
 
receive all proceeds related to any judgment or settlement of same. The Executive agrees to execute and deliver to the Corporation any instruments the Corporation deems necessary to vest in the Corporation sole title to and all exclusive rights in the Developments created by the Executive alone or with others during the term of the Executive's employment, and in all related trademarks, copyrights, mask work protection rights, and/or patent rights so created during the term of employment. The Executive agrees to execute and deliver to the Corporation all proper papers for use in applying for, obtaining, maintaining, amending and enforcing all such trademarks, copyrights, patents or such other legal protections as the Corporation may desire. The Executive further agrees to assist fully the Corporation or its nominees in the preparation and prosecution of any trademark, copyright, mask work protection, patent or trade secret arbitration or litigation. The Executive shall be reimbursed on a reasonable hourly basis consistent with the compensation provided for herein for the Executive's services rendered following termination of employment.
 
 
 
 
 
(i) For purposes of this subsection 10(j), (1) a Payment shall mean any payment or distribution in the nature of compensation to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise; (2) Agreement Payment shall mean a Payment paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement (disregarding this subsection 10(j)); (2) Net After Tax Receipts shall mean the Present Value of a Payment net of all taxes imposed on the Executive with respect thereto under Sections 1 and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), determined by applying the highest marginal rate under Section 1 of the Code applicable to the Executive's taxable income for such year; (4) "Present Value" shall mean such value determined in accordance with Section 280G(d) (4) of the Code; and (5) "Reduced Amount" shall mean the greatest aggregate amount of Payments, if any, which (x) is less than the sum of all Payments and (y) results in aggregate Net After Tax Receipts which are greater than the Net After Tax Receipts which would result if the aggregate Payments were made.
(ii) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event PriceWaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. (or if PriceWaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. is the audit firm for the Corporation at the time, another accounting firm of nationally recognized standing selected by Executive) (the "Accounting Firm") shall determine that receipt of all Payments would subject the Executive to tax under Section 4999 of the Code, it shall determine whether
 
some amount of Payments would meet the definition of a "Reduced Amount." If the Accounting Firm determines that there is a Reduced Amount, the aggregate Agreement Payments shall be reduced to such Reduced Amount; provided, however, that if the Reduced Amount exceeds the aggregate Agreement Payments, the aggregate Payments shall, after the reduction of all Agreement Payments, be reduced (but not below zero) in the amount of such excess. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section shall be binding upon the Corporation and the Executive and shall be made within 60 days of the occurrence of an event which requires the Corporation to make payments to the Executive under this Agreement. No later than two business days following the making of this determination by the Accounting Firm, the Corporation shall pay to or distribute for the benefit of the Executive such Payments as are then due to the Executive under this Agreement and shall promptly pay to or distribute for the benefit of the Executive in the future such Payments as become due to the Executive under this Agreement. The Corporation or its successor shall pay for the work done by the Accounting Firm. In the event that the Accounting Firm is unable or unwilling to make the determinations to be made under this subsection 10(j) or for any reason such determinations are not made within 60 days of the occurrence of the event which requires the Corporation to make payments to the Executive under this Agreement, the Corporation shall make all Payments as are then due to the Executive without reduction no later than two business days following the 60th day after the occurrence of the event which required the Corporation to make payments to the Executive under this Agreement.
(iii) While it is the intention of the Corporation and the Executive to reduce the amounts payable or distributable to the Executive hereunder only if the aggregate Net After Tax Receipts to the Executive would thereby be increased, as a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed by the Corporation to or for the benefit of the Executive pursuant to this Agreement which should not have been so paid or distributed ("Overpayments") or that additional amounts which will not have been paid or distributed by the Corporation to or for the benefit of the Executive pursuant to this Agreement could have been so paid or distributed ("Underpayment"), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based either upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against the Corporation or the Executive which the Accounting Firm believes
 
has a high probability of success or controlling precedent or other substantial authority, determines that an Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment paid or distributed by the Corporation to or for the benefit of the Executive shall be treated for all purposes as a loan ab initio to the Executive which the Executive shall repay to the Corporation together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f) (2) of the Code; provided, however, that no such loan shall be deemed to have been made and no amount shall be payable by the Executive to the Corporation if and to the extent such deemed loan and payment would not either reduce the amount on which the Executive is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or other substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Corporation to or for the benefit of the Executive together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f) (2) of the Code.
 
     , this Agreement has been executed on the date first above written.

Exhibit 99.1
Michael McAndrew, Chief Financial Officer Black Box Corporation (724) 873-6788 (724) 873-6799 (fax) Email: investors@blackbox.com
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, October 30, 2007  Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported results for the second quarter of Fiscal 2008 ended September 29, 2007.
For the second quarter of Fiscal 2008, diluted earnings per share were 64 on net income of $11.3 million or 4.3% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of 66 on net income of $11.7 million or 4.3% of revenues for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, first quarter of Fiscal 2008 diluted earnings per share were 46 on net income of $8.2 million or 3.2% of revenues. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) for second quarter of Fiscal 2008 were 87 on operating net income (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) of $15.4 million or 5.9% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of 91 on operating net income of $16.2 million or 6.0% of revenues for the same quarter last year. Management believes that presenting operating earnings per share and operating net income is useful to investors because it provides a more meaningful comparison of the ongoing operations of the Company.
For the second quarter of Fiscal 2008, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $6.5 million with an after tax impact on net income and EPS of $4.1 million and 23, respectively. During the second quarter of Fiscal 2007, as previously disclosed, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $6.9 million with an after tax impact on net income and EPS of $4.5 million and 25, respectively. See below for further discussion regarding management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements and a detailed presentation of the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the periods presented above.
Second quarter of Fiscal 2008 total revenues were $261 million, a decrease of $10 million or 4% from $271 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, first quarter of Fiscal 2008 total revenues were $252 million.
Second quarter of Fiscal 2008 cash provided by operating activities was $5 million or 40% of net income, compared to $9 million or 78% of net income for the same quarter last year. Second quarter of Fiscal 2008 free cash flow (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) was $8 million compared to $12 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, first quarter of Fiscal 2008 cash provided by operating activities was $8 million or 94% of net income and free cash flow was $7 million. Black Box utilized its second quarter of Fiscal 2008 free cash flow to fund debt reduction of $5 million, to pay dividends of $1 million, to fund capital expenditures of $1 million and to increase its cash position by $1 million. Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company.
For the six month period ended September 29, 2007, diluted earnings per share were $1.10 on net income of $19.5 million or 3.8% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.04 on net income of $18.5 million or 3.7% of revenues for the same period last year. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share for the six month period ended September 29, 2007 were $1.60 on operating net income of $28.2 million or 5.5% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of $1.51 on operating net income of $26.8 million or 5.3% of revenues for the same period last year.
For the six month period ended September 29, 2007, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $13.9 million with an after tax impact on net income and EPS of $8.7 million and 50, respectively. For the six month period ended September 30, 2006, as previously disclosed, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $12.7 million with an after tax impact on net income and EPS of $8.3 million and 47, respectively. See below for further discussion regarding management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements and a detailed presentation of the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the periods presented above.

For the six month period ended September 29, 2007, total revenues were $513 million, an increase of $11 million or 2% from $502 million for the same period last year.
Cash provided by operating activities for the six month period ended September 29, 2007 was $12 million or 63% of net income compared to $22 million or 117% of net income for the same period last year. Free cash flow was $15 million compared to $26 million for the same period last year. Black Box utilized its six-month period free cash flow to fund debt reduction of $8 million, to fund payments due on prior period acquisition activity of $3 million, to pay dividends of $2 million, to fund capital expenditures of $1 million and to increase its cash position by $1 million.
The Company's 6-month order backlog was $166 million at September 29, 2007 compared to $165 million for the same quarter ended last year. On a sequential quarter end comparison basis, the Company's 6-month order backlog was $165 million at June 30, 2007.
For Fiscal 2008, the Company continues to target reported revenues of approximately $1.0 billion; corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of $3.30 to $3.50; and cash provided by operating activities in the range of 80% to 90% of operating net income.
All of the above ranges exclude acquisition-related expense, stock-based compensation expense, any restructuring / severance / other costs related to the NextiraOne, LLC ("NextiraOne") integration plan, historical stock option granting practices investigation costs, expenses incurred as a result of measures taken by the Company to address the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the impact of changes in the fair market value of the Company's interest rate swap, and are before any new mergers and acquisition activity that has not been announced.
Commenting on the second quarter results, Terry Blakemore, President and Chief Executive Officer said, "We are very pleased with our overall results for the second quarter. The Black Box team has delivered strong Revenues, Operating EPS and operating cash flow over the first six months of the fiscal year which are consistent with achieving our targeted ranges for Fiscal 2008. Similar to the organic growth achieved in the first quarter, we are particularly pleased with the 5% organic revenue growth realized in the second quarter as well as improved profit margins. The progress in the NextiraOne integration is continuing to drive the improved operating profitability."
Mr. Blakemore went on to say, "We have a clear strategy, with well-defined priorities as we continue to focus on leveraging our financial strength to add high-quality service providers via mergers and acquisitions while continuing to implement programs to deliver strong organic growth. The results we have achieved are evidence that our strategy is working."
"In summary, our expectations for Black Box in FY08 remain high. We remain committed to delivering the highest quality technical DVH services to our global client base while executing a business model that is delivering strong and sustainable operating results which we believe will translate to increased shareholder value."

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
As a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures such as free cash flow, cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments, operating net income, operating earnings per share (EPS), Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") and Adjusted EBITDA to illustrate the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided Management explanations regarding their use and the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures which are provided below.
Management uses non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and (e) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members. Moreover, the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude restructuring, severance and other acquisition integration costs (collectively referred to as "restructuring charges" or "restructuring payments") incurred during the periods reported that will impact future operating results, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (iv) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash stock-based compensation charges, which are similar to cash compensation paid to employees and is an integral part of achieving our operating results, (v) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years which is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets, (vi) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude historical stock option granting practices investigation costs, (vii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash change in fair value of the interest rate swap which will continue to impact the Company's earnings until the interest rate swap is settled and (viii) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
Net capital expenditures
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be taken into account along with cash provided by operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures are typically material and directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.
Proceeds from stock option exercises
The Company believes that proceeds from stock option exercises should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the actual cash available to the Company. The Company has demonstrated a recurring inflow of cash related to its stock-based compensation plans and since this cash is immediately available to the Company, it directly impacts the availability of the Company's operating cash. The amount of proceeds from stock option exercises is dependent upon a number of variables, including the number and exercise price of outstanding options and the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the timing of stock option exercises is under the control of the individual option holder and is not in the control of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of any proceeds from stock option exercises.
 
Page 8
Foreign currency translation adjustment
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to U.S. dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive and / or negative impact of such charges as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in U.S. dollars.
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities plus restructuring payments. Restructuring payments are the cash payments made during the period for restructuring charges. The Company believes that restructuring payments should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the cash flow from operations.
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is presented below:
Operating net income and operating earnings per share (EPS)
Management believes that operating net income, defined by the Company as net income plus reconciling items, provides investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in a way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Reconciling items include restructuring charges, amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, stock-based compensation expense, asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions, historical stock option granting practices investigation costs and the change in fair value of the interest rate swap and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below:
Restructuring charges
The Company believes that incurring costs in the current period(s) as part of a restructuring plan or as a result of economies of scale from acquisitions will result in a long-term positive impact on financial performance in the future. Restructuring charges are presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. However, due to the material amount of additional costs incurred during a single or possibly successive periods, Management believes that exclusion of these costs and their related tax impact provides a more accurate reflection of the Company's ongoing financial performance.
Amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
 
Page 9
Stock-based compensation expense
The Company records non-cash stock-based compensation expense equal to the fair value of share-based payment awards to its directors, executives and employees. Stock-based compensation expense is an integral part of ongoing operations since it is considered similar to other types of compensation to employees. However, Management believes that varying levels of stock-based compensation expense could result in misleading period-over-period comparisons and is providing an adjusted disclosure, which excludes stock-based compensation and its related tax impact.
Asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions
The Company incurs non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years. Specifically, this non-cash expenditure is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets. Asset write-ups are depreciated over their remaining useful life which generally falls between one to five years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed from acquisition to the end of the asset's useful life, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Historical stock option granting practices investigation costs
The Company incurred significant costs in connection with its investigation of historical stock option granting practices during the current year. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Change in fair value of the interest rate swap
To mitigate the risk of interest-rate fluctuations associated with the Company's variable rate debt, the Company entered into a five-year interest rate swap ("interest rate swap") that does not qualify as a cash flow hedge. Thus, the Company records the change in fair value of the interest rate swap as an asset/liability within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with the offset to Interest expense (income) within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Management excludes this non-cash expense (income) and the related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
The following table represents the Company's pre-tax reconciling items:

A reconciliation of net income to operating net income is presented below:
A reconciliation of diluted earnings per common share (EPS) to operating EPS (may not sum due to rounding) is presented below:
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
Management believes that EBITDA, defined as income before provision for income taxes plus interest, depreciation and amortization, is a widely accepted measure of profitability that may be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Adjusted EBITDA, defined as EBITDA plus stock compensation expense, may also be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt.
A reconciliation of net income to EBITDA is presented below:

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, January 29, 2008 -- Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported results for the third quarter of Fiscal 2008 ended December 29, 2007.
For the third quarter of Fiscal 2008, diluted earnings per share were 47 on net income of $8.3 million or 3.2% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of 59 on net income of $10.5 million or 4.0% of revenues for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, second quarter of Fiscal 2008 diluted earnings per share were 64 on net income of $11.3 million or 4.3% of revenues. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) for the third quarter of Fiscal 2008 were 84 on operating net income (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) of $14.8 million or 5.7% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of 78 on operating net income of $13.8 million or 5.2% of revenues for the same quarter last year. Management believes that presenting operating earnings per share and operating net income is useful to investors because it provides a more meaningful comparison of the ongoing operations of the Company.
For the third quarter of Fiscal 2008, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $10.9 million with an after tax impact on net income and EPS of $6.6 million and 37, respectively. During the third quarter of Fiscal 2007, as previously disclosed, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $5.1 million with an after tax impact on net income and EPS of $3.3 million and 19, respectively. See below for further discussion regarding Management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements and a detailed presentation of the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the periods presented above.
Third quarter of Fiscal 2008 total revenues were $258 million, a decrease of $7 million or 2% from $265 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, second quarter of Fiscal 2008 total revenues were $261 million.
Third quarter of Fiscal 2008 cash provided by operating activities was $25 million or 296% of net income, compared to $3 million or 27% of net income for the same quarter last year. Third quarter of Fiscal 2008 free cash flow (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) was $23 million compared to $7 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, second quarter of Fiscal 2008 cash provided by operating activities was $5 million or 40% of net income and free cash flow was $8 million. Black Box utilized its third quarter of Fiscal 2008 free cash flow to fund current period acquisitions of $11 million, to fund debt reduction of $11 million and to pay dividends of $1 million. Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company.
For the nine-month period ended December 29, 2007, diluted earnings per share were $1.57 on net income of $27.8 million or 3.6% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.63 on net income of $29.0 million or 3.8% of revenues for the same period last year. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share for the nine-month period ended December 29, 2007 were $2.44 on operating net income of $43.1 million or 5.6% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of $2.28 on operating net income of $40.6 million or 5.3% of revenues for the same period last year.
For the nine-month period ended December 29, 2007, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $24.8 million with an after tax impact on net income and EPS of $15.3 million and 87, respectively. For the nine-month period ended December 30, 2006, as previously disclosed, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $17.8 million with an after tax impact on net income and EPS of $11.6 million and 65, respectively. See below for further discussion regarding Management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements and a detailed presentation of the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the periods presented above.

For the nine-month period ended December 29, 2007, total revenues were $771 million, an increase of $4 million or 1% from $767 million for the same period last year.
Cash provided by operating activities for the nine-month period ended December 29, 2007 was $37 million or 132% of net income compared to $25 million or 85% of net income for the same period last year. Free cash flow was $38 million compared to $33 million for the same period last year. Black Box utilized its nine-month period free cash flow to fund debt reduction of $19 million, to fund current period acquisitions of $11 million, to pay dividends of $3 million, to increase its cash position by $3 million and to fund payments due on prior period acquisition activity of $2 million.
The Company's six-month order backlog was $165 million at December 29, 2007 compared to $162 million for the same quarter ended last year. On a sequential quarter end comparison basis, the Company's six-month order backlog was $166 million at September 29, 2007.
As a result of an increase in the Company's current effective tax rate to 38.0%, the Company's current targets for Fiscal 2008 are reported revenues of approximately $1.0 billion; corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of $3.25 to $3.35; and cash provided by operating activities in the range of 80% to 90% of operating net income.
All of the above ranges exclude acquisition-related expense, stock-based compensation expense, any restructuring / severance / other costs related to the NextiraOne, LLC ("NextiraOne") integration plan, historical stock option granting practices investigation costs, expenses incurred as a result of measures taken by the Company to address the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the impact of changes in the fair market value of the Company's interest rate swap, and are before any new mergers and acquisition activity that has not been announced.
Commenting on the third quarter results, Terry Blakemore, President and Chief Executive Officer said, "The Black Box team has delivered revenues, operating income and operating cash flow over the first nine months of our fiscal year which are consistent with achieving our targeted ranges for FY08. We are particularly pleased with another quarter of year over year organic same store growth. Operating cash flow of approximately $25 million for the quarter and $37 million year-to-date reflects our ability to translate our diversified revenue growth into cash while making strategic investments for the future."
Mr. Blakemore went on to say, "We continue to execute our strategy, with well-defined priorities as we remain focused on leveraging our financial strength to add high-quality service providers via mergers and acquisitions while continuing to implement programs to deliver strong profitable organic growth."
"As we, along with the rest of the global community, enter into an uncertain economic environment, our expectations for Black Box remain high. We will continue to focus on the strengths of our business and remain committed to delivering the highest quality technical DVH services to our worldwide client base."

As a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures such as free cash flow, cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments, operating net income, operating earnings per share (EPS), Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating income and Same-office revenue comparisons to illustrate the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided Management explanations regarding their use and the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which are provided below.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and (e) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members. Moreover, the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude restructuring, severance and other acquisition integration costs (collectively referred to as "restructuring charges" or "restructuring payments") incurred during the periods reported that will impact future operating results, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (iv) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash stock-based compensation charges, which are similar to cash compensation paid to employees and are an integral part of achieving our operating results, (v) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years which is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets, (vi) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude historical stock option granting practices investigation costs, (vii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash change in fair value of the interest rate swap which will continue to impact the Company's earnings until the interest rate swap is settled, (viii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude expenses incurred as a result of measures taken by the Company to address the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (hereinafter referred to as "409A expenses") and (ix) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
Free cash flow
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be taken into account along with cash provided by operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures are typically material and directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.
Net capital expenditures
 
Page 8
The Company believes that proceeds from stock option exercises should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the actual cash available to the Company. The Company has demonstrated a recurring inflow of cash related to its stock-based compensation plans and since this cash is immediately available to the Company, it directly impacts the availability of the Company's operating cash. The amount of proceeds from stock option exercises is dependent upon a number of variables, including the number and exercise price of outstanding options and the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the timing of stock option exercises is under the control of the individual option holder and is not in the control of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of any proceeds from stock option exercises.
Proceeds from stock option exercises
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to U.S. dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive and / or negative impact of such charges as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in U.S. dollars.
Foreign currency translation adjustment
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities plus restructuring payments. Restructuring payments are the cash payments made during the period for restructuring charges. The Company believes that restructuring payments should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the cash flow from operations.
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is presented below:
Management believes that operating net income, defined by the Company as net income plus reconciling items, and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provide investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in a way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Reconciling items include restructuring charges, amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, stock-based compensation expense, asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions, historical stock option granting practices investigation costs, the change in fair value of the interest rate swap and 409A expenses. Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below.
Operating net income and operating earnings per share (EPS)
The Company believes that incurring costs in the current period(s) as part of a restructuring plan or as a result of economies of scale from acquisitions will result in a long-term positive impact on financial performance in the future. Restructuring charges are presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. However, due to the material amount of additional costs incurred during a single or possibly successive periods, Management believes that exclusion of these costs and their related tax impact provides a more accurate reflection of the Company's ongoing financial performance.
Restructuring charges
 
Page 9
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions
The Company records non-cash stock-based compensation expense equal to the fair value of share-based payment awards to its directors, executives and employees. Non-cash stock-based compensation is an integral part of ongoing operations since it is considered similar to other types of compensation to employees. However, Management believes that varying levels of stock-based compensation expense could result in misleading period-over-period comparisons and is providing an adjusted disclosure, which excludes stock-based compensation and its related tax impact.
Stock-based compensation expense
The Company incurs non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years. Specifically, this non-cash expenditure is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets. Asset write-ups are depreciated over their remaining useful life which generally falls between one to five years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed from acquisition to the end of the asset's useful life, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions
The Company incurred significant costs in connection with its investigation of historical stock option granting practices during the current year. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Historical stock option granting practices investigation costs
To mitigate the risk of interest-rate fluctuations associated with the Company's variable rate debt, the Company entered into a five-year interest rate swap ("interest rate swap") that does not qualify as a cash flow hedge. Thus, the Company records the change in fair value of the interest rate swap as an asset/liability within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with the offset to Interest expense (income) within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Management excludes this non-cash expense (income) and the related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Change in fair value of the interest rate swap
The Company incurred significant costs as a result of measures taken to address the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, related to its stock options. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.

Management believes that EBITDA, defined as income before provision for income taxes plus interest, depreciation and amortization, is a widely accepted measure of profitability that may be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Adjusted EBITDA, defined as EBITDA plus stock compensation expense, may also be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On January 30, 2008, Black Box Corporation of Pennsylvania ("BBCPA") and Norstan, Inc. ("Norstan" and together with BBCPA, the "Borrowers"), each wholly-owned subsidiaries of Black Box Corporation ("Parent"), Parent and certain subsidiaries owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent (collectively, with Parent, the "Guarantors" and together with the Borrowers, the "Loan Parties") entered into a revolving senior credit facility (the "Loan Facility") in the form of a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania, as administrative agent ("Agent"), and certain other lender parties (together with the Agent, the "Lenders").
     Borrowings under the Loan Facility are permitted up to a maximum amount of $350,000,000, including up to $20,000,000 of swingline loans and $25,000,000 of letters of credit. The Loan Facility may be increased by Borrowers up to an additional $100,000,000 with the approval of the Lenders and may be unilaterally and permanently reduced by Borrowers to not less than the then outstanding amount of all borrowings (including letters of credit and swingline loans) under the Loan Facility upon not less than 10 business days written notice.
     Initial borrowings under the Loan Facility were used to refinance the existing credit facility of Borrowers. Borrowings under the Loan Facility may also be used for acquisitions, to provide Parent funds for the repurchase of its common stock and for other general corporate purposes.
     The Loan Facility is unsecured, but is guaranteed by Parent and all of Parent's directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries that are incorporated (or organized) under the laws of the District of Columbia or under the laws of any state or commonwealth of the United States.
     Interest on outstanding indebtedness under the Loan Facility currently accrues, at the Company's option, at a rate based on either: (a) the greater of (i) the prime rate per annum of Agent then in effect and (ii) 0.50% the rate per annum announced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as being the weighted average of the rates on overnight Federal funds transactions arranged by Federal funds brokers on the previous trading day or (b) a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR rate 0.50% to 1.125% (determined by a leverage ratio based on the Parent's consolidated EBITDA).
plus
plus
     The Loan Facility matures on January 30, 2013 and requires compliance with conditions precedent that must be satisfied prior to any borrowing as well as ongoing compliance with certain affirmative and negative covenants applicable to the Loan Parties.
     Conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the Loan Facility and the initial borrowing were satisfied on January 31, 2008.

A certificate of the Swingline Lender submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
            (iv)      Each Lender's obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this Section 2.13(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swingline Lender, the Borrowers or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Potential Default or Event of Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.13(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.02.

As previously disclosed, the Audit Committee of the Board (the "Audit Committee") completed its independent review of the Company's historical stock option granting practices. See the "Explanatory Note" preceding Part I, Item 1 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 (the "Form 10-K") for more information regarding the Audit Committee's review and related matters. In light of the findings of its review, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board adopted, enhancements to the Company's corporate record-keeping and stock option granting procedures.
The following is a summary of such enhancements:
Enhancements Regarding Stock Option Granting Practices

ITEM: Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review
 
 
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
Item 4.02   Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
     (a) Black Box Corporation ("Black Box" or the "Company") has identified an overstatement of $4,687 of previously-recognized non-cash stock-based compensation expense (the "Expense Overstatement") reported in its previously-issued financial statements and related disclosures as of and for the three (3) and nine (9) month periods ended December 29, 2007, including those set forth in its previously-issued Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended December 29, 2007 (the "3Q08 Form 10-Q"), its press release dated January 29, 2008 (the "Press Release") and its Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 29, 2008 (the "3Q08 Form 8-K"), relating to the Company's valuation methodologies for certain stock option transactions that occurred during the third quarter ("3Q08") of its fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 ("Fiscal 2008").
     As noted below, the Company will file a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A to amend its 3Q08 Form 10-Q (the "Form 10-Q/A") to reverse the effects of the Expense Overstatement by restating its financial statements and related disclosures as of and for the three (3) and nine (9) month periods ended December 29, 2007.
      With respect to the financial results for 3Q08, the reversal of the $4,687 pre-tax charge related to previously-recognized non-cash stock-based compensation expense will have no impact on Revenues or Cash provided by operating activities, will increase Operating income by $4,687, Net income by approximately $3,055 and Diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.17 and will have an immaterial impact on Operating earnings per share.
     During 3Q08, the Company conducted a tender offer to current non-officer employees subject to taxation in the United States who held stock option grants which were originally issued with exercise prices that were below fair market value for income tax purposes. The applicable stock option grants were subject to adverse income taxation under Section 409A ("Section 409A") of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the tender offer afforded those employees the opportunity to avoid unfavorable tax consequences under Section 409A. Under the provisions of the tender offer, if the original exercise price of an option grant was the same or higher than the fair market value of the Company's common stock, par value $.001 per share, on the first business day following the close of the tender offer, then that option would be canceled and immediately replaced with a new option granted under the Company's 1992 Stock Option Plan, as amended, that had the exact same terms as the canceled option, but with a new grant date. Such cancellation and re-grant was necessary to evidence the remedial action required under Section 409A. The Company accounted for the cancellation and new grant as two separate transactions ( the cancellation of the original grant and the issuance of a new grant) and computed a fair market value for the new grant on the new grant date determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"). As a result, the Company recognized a pre-tax charge of $4,687 of non-cash stock-based compensation expense equal to the fair market value of the new grant on the new grant date.
i.e.,
 
     During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2008, the Company re-evaluated its valuation methodology, as described above, and determined that the cancellation and new grant transaction should have been valued as a modification under SFAS 123R. Accordingly, the Company should have recorded only the incremental compensation cost measured as the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the modified award over the fair market value of the original award immediately before its terms were modified. Under the circumstances, there were no changes to any of the terms of the original option grants and, as a result, the Company should have recorded $0 of non-cash stock-based compensation expense for 3Q08 from the tender offer as compared to the pre-tax charge of $4,687 for non-cash stock-based compensation expense that had been previously-recognized.
     As a result of the Expense Overstatement, on April 23, 2008, Black Box management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Audit Committee") concluded that the Company's previously-issued financial statements and related disclosures as of and for the three (3) and nine (9) month periods ended December 29, 2007, including those set forth in the 3Q08 Form 10-Q, the Press Release and the 3Q08 Form 8-K, should not be relied upon.
     The Company expects that it will file the Form 10-Q/A within 10 business days of the date of this filing.
     Company management and the Audit Committee have discussed the matters in this filing pursuant to Item 4.02(a) with BDO Seidman, LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.
     This Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements" under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including those that involve the risks, uncertainties and potential consequences relating to the restatement of the Company's financial statements described herein, including the preparation and filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") of the Form 10-Q/A. Any forward-looking statements contained in this release are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the fact that they use words such as "should," "anticipate," "estimate," "approximate," "expect," "target," "may," "will," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe" and other words of similar meaning and expression. One can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors, they may include the process of restating the Company's 3Q08 financial statements and the filing of the Form 10-Q/A with the SEC. We can give no assurance that any goal, plan, date or target set forth in forward-looking statements can be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of future events or developments.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, May 22, 2008 -- Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported results for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2008 and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008.
For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2008, diluted earnings per share were 48 on net income of $8.4 million or 3.4% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of 37 on net income of $6.6 million or 2.7% of revenues for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, third quarter of Fiscal 2008 diluted earnings per share were 64 on net income of $11.3 million or 4.4% of revenues. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2008 were 74 on operating net income (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) of $13.1 million or 5.3% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of 69 on operating net income of $12.2 million or 4.9% of revenues for the same quarter last year. Management believes that presenting operating earnings per share and operating net income is useful to investors because it provides a more meaningful comparison of the ongoing operations of the Company.
For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2008, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $7.8 million with an after tax impact on net income and EPS of $4.7 million and 26, respectively. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $8.8 million with an after tax impact on net income and EPS of $5.6 million and 32, respectively. See below for further discussion regarding Management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements and a detailed presentation of the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the periods presented above.
Fourth quarter of Fiscal 2008 total revenues were $245 million, a decrease of $5 million or 2% from $250 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, third quarter of Fiscal 2008 total revenues were $258 million.
Fourth quarter of Fiscal 2008 cash provided by operating activities was $44 million or 528% of net income, compared to $12 million or 181% of net income for the same quarter last year. Fourth quarter of Fiscal 2008 free cash flow (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) was $43 million compared to $13 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, third quarter of Fiscal 2008 cash provided by operating activities was $25 million or 216% of net income and free cash flow was $23 million. Black Box utilized its fourth quarter of Fiscal 2008 free cash flow primarily to fund debt reduction of $24 million, to increase its cash position by $7 million, to repurchase $6 million of its common stock, to fund current and prior period acquisition activity of $4 million and to pay dividends of $1 million. Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company.
Fiscal 2008 diluted earnings per share were $2.22 on net income of $39.2 million or 3.9% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of $2.00 on net income of $35.6 million or 3.5% of revenues for the same period last year. Excluding reconciling items, Fiscal 2008 operating earnings per share were $3.20 on operating net income of $56.5 million or 5.6% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of $2.97 on operating net income of $52.8 million or 5.2% of revenues for the same period last year.
For Fiscal 2008, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $27.9 million with an after tax impact on net income and EPS of $17.2 million and 98, respectively. For Fiscal 2007, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $26.5 million with an after tax impact on net income and EPS of $17.2 million and 97, respectively. See below for further discussion regarding Management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements and a detailed presentation of the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the periods presented above.

Fiscal 2008 total revenues were $1.02 billion, equivalent to $1.02 billion for the same period last year.
Fiscal 2008 cash provided by operating activities was $81 million or 207% of net income compared to $37 million or 103% of net income for the same period last year. Free cash flow was $81 million compared to $46 million for the same period last year. Black Box utilized its Fiscal 2008 free cash flow primarily to fund debt reduction of $43 million, to fund current and prior period acquisition activity of $17 million, to increase its cash position by $9 million, to repurchase $6 million of its common stock and to pay dividends of $4 million.
The Company's six-month order backlog was $159 million at March 31, 2008 compared to $159 million for the same quarter ended last year. On a sequential quarter end comparison basis, the Company's six-month order backlog was $165 million at December 29, 2007.
For Fiscal 2009, the Company is targeting reported revenues of approximately $1.0 billion; corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of $3.25 to $3.40; and cash provided by operating activities in the range of 90% to 100% of operating net income.
All of the above exclude acquisition-related expense, stock-based compensation expense, historical stock option granting practices investigation costs and the impact of changes in the fair market value of the Company's interest rate swap, and all of the above are before any new mergers and acquisition activity that has not been announced.
Commenting on Fiscal 2008 and the Fiscal 2009 outlook, Terry Blakemore, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We realized many significant accomplishments in Fiscal 2008. We achieved the highest Revenues the Company has experienced during its 32 year existence at $1.0 billion, which includes 5% organic growth (3% organic growth excluding the impact of foreign currency)."
"Additionally, we are especially pleased with achieving 10.6% Adjusted Operating income percentage, up nearly a full point from Fiscal 2007. This was primarily the result of the continued success of integrating NextiraOne. Most notably, we generated record operating cash flow of $44 million for the fourth quarter and $81 million for the fiscal year. In combination, we believe these financial accomplishments significantly strengthen our position in this competitive marketplace. We continue to believe that the Black Box technical service model is unique to the industry and provides the best value proposition to our clients, which allows us to achieve these types of results."
Mr. Blakemore went on to say, "As we look to Fiscal 2009, we are taking a pragmatic view of the current economic environment and its effects on our end-markets. Our current projections for Fiscal 2009 are based on achieving Revenues of approximately $1.0 billion for a third consecutive year coupled with a significant improvement in Adjusted Operating income percentage to over 11% and the continued generation of substantial operating cash flow. With all of that in mind, we will continue to stay focused on providing the highest quality technical support services, Data, Voice and Hotline, to our clients around the world while continuing to strategically leverage our operational and financial strengths in support of our longer term goal to significantly grow Black Box by consummating high quality M&A opportunities."

As a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures such as free cash flow, cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments, operating net income, operating earnings per share (EPS), Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating income and Same-office revenue comparisons to illustrate the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided Management explanations regarding their use and the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which are provided below.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and (e) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members. Moreover, the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude restructuring, severance and other acquisition integration costs (collectively referred to as "restructuring charges" or "restructuring payments") incurred during the periods reported that will impact future operating results, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, they do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (iv) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash stock-based compensation charges, which are similar to cash compensation paid to employees and are an integral part of achieving our operating results, (v) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years which is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets, (vi) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude historical stock option granting practices investigation costs, (vii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash change in fair value of the interest rate swap which will continue to impact the Company's earnings until the interest rate swap is settled, (viii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude expenses incurred as a result of measures taken by the Company to address the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (hereinafter referred to as "409A expenses") and (ix) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
Free cash flow
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be taken into account along with cash provided by operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures are typically material and directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.

The Company believes that proceeds from stock option exercises should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the actual cash available to the Company. The Company has demonstrated a recurring inflow of cash related to its stock-based compensation plans and since this cash is immediately available to the Company, it directly impacts the availability of the Company's operating cash. The amount of proceeds from stock option exercises is dependent upon a number of variables, including the number and exercise price of outstanding options and the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the timing of stock option exercises is under the control of the individual option holder and is not in the control of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of any proceeds from stock option exercises.
Proceeds from stock option exercises
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to U.S. dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive and / or negative impact of such charges as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in U.S. dollars.
Foreign currency translation adjustment
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities plus restructuring payments. Restructuring payments are the cash payments made during the period for restructuring charges. The Company believes that restructuring payments should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the cash flow from operations.
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is presented below:
Management believes that operating net income, defined by the Company as net income plus reconciling items, and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provide investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in a way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Reconciling items include restructuring charges, amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, stock-based compensation expense, asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions, historical stock option granting practices investigation costs, the change in fair value of the interest rate swap and 409A expenses. Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below.
Operating net income and operating earnings per share (EPS)
The Company believes that incurring costs in the current period(s) as part of a restructuring plan or as a result of economies of scale from acquisitions will result in a long-term positive impact on financial performance in the future. Restructuring charges are presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. However, due to the material amount of additional costs incurred during a single or possibly successive periods, Management believes that exclusion of these costs and their related tax impact provides a more accurate reflection of the Company's ongoing financial performance.
Restructuring charges
 
Page 9
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions
The Company records non-cash stock-based compensation expense equal to the fair value of share-based payment awards to its directors, executives and employees. Non-cash stock-based compensation is an integral part of ongoing operations since it is considered similar to other types of compensation to employees. However, Management believes that varying levels of stock-based compensation expense could result in misleading period-over-period comparisons and is providing an adjusted disclosure, which excludes stock-based compensation and its related tax impact.
Stock-based compensation expense
The Company incurs non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years. Specifically, this non-cash expenditure is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets. Asset write-ups are depreciated over their remaining useful life which generally falls between one to five years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed from acquisition to the end of the asset's useful life, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions
The Company incurred significant costs in connection with its investigation of historical stock option granting practices during the current year. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Historical stock option granting practices investigation costs
To mitigate the risk of interest-rate fluctuations associated with the Company's variable rate debt, the Company entered into a five-year interest rate swap ("interest rate swap") that does not qualify as a cash flow hedge. Thus, the Company records the change in fair value of the interest rate swap as an asset/liability within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with the offset to Interest expense (income) within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Management excludes this non-cash expense (income) and the related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Change in fair value of the interest rate swap
The Company incurred significant costs as a result of measures taken to address the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, related to its stock options. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.

Management believes that EBITDA, defined as income before provision for income taxes plus interest, depreciation and amortization, is a widely accepted measure of profitability that may be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Adjusted EBITDA, defined as EBITDA plus stock compensation expense, may also be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt.

Item 5.02   Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
     (e) On May 28, 2008, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Black Box Corporation (the "Company") recommended that the Board approve, and the Board approved, an annual incentive bonus plan (the "Annual Incentive Plan") for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009. The performance goals for the Annual Incentive Plan are operating earnings per share, adjusted operating income as a percentage of total revenues, adjusted EBITDA ("Adjusted EBITDA") and DSOs (as each of those measurements is determined consistent with the Company's press release dated May 22, 2008 filed as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K for the event dated May 22, 2008). The performance goals will be equally weighted. Under the Annual Incentive Plan, the achievement of the performance goals at approximately 90% of target will result in a payout of 50% of targeted annual bonus, the achievement of the performance goals at 100% of target will result in a payout of 100% of targeted annual bonus and the achievement of the performance goals at approximately 110% of target will result in a payout of 150% of targeted annual bonus. Following Board review and approval, the Committee made targeted annual bonus awards under the Annual Incentive Plan to the Company's executive officers as follows: R. Terry Blakemore, President and Chief Executive Officer -- 100% of base salary or $550,000; Michael McAndrew, Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary -- 80% of base salary or $252,000; and Francis W. Wertheimber, Senior Vice President -- 50% of base salary or $132,500.
     In addition, on May 28, 2008, the Committee recommended that the Board approve, and the Board approved, a new Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "LTIP") for the two fiscal years ending March 31, 2010. The LTIP is comprised of a cash performance award representing 60% of the award and a stock option grant representing 40% of the award. The cash performance award will be earned based on the Company's cumulative Adjusted EBITDA for the two fiscal years ending March 31, 2010, and will be paid out at 50% of the targeted cash award based on achievement of 75% of the Adjusted EBITDA target, 100% of the targeted cash award based on achievement of 100% of the Adjusted EBITDA target and 150% of the targeted cash award based on achievement of 120% of the Adjusted EBITDA target. The stock options granted pursuant to the LTIP will vest over a three-year period. Following Board review and approval, the Committee made the following awards under the LTIP to the Company's executive officers: Mr. Blakemore -- a targeted cash award of $1,200,000 and a stock option grant for 80,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value $.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), with an exercise price of $28.93 per share; Mr. McAndrew -- a targeted cash award of $300,000 and a stock option grant for 20,000 shares of Common Stock with an exercise price of $28.93 per share; and Mr. Wertheimber -- a targeted cash award of $150,000 and a stock option grant for 10,000 shares of Common Stock with an exercise price of $28.93 per share.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, July 29, 2008  Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported results for the first quarter of Fiscal 2009 ended June 28, 2008.
For the first quarter of Fiscal 2009, diluted earnings per share were 73 on net income of $12.8 million or 5.3% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of 46 on net income of $8.2 million or 3.2% of revenues for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, fourth quarter of Fiscal 2008 diluted earnings per share were 48 on net income of $8.4 million or 3.4% of revenues. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) for the first quarter of Fiscal 2009 were 74 on operating net income (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) of $12.9 million or 5.3% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of 73 on operating net income of $12.8 million or 5.1% of revenues for the same quarter last year. Management believes that presenting operating earnings per share and operating net income is useful to investors because it provides a more meaningful comparison of the ongoing operations of the Company.
For the first quarter of Fiscal 2009, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $0.1 million with an after-tax impact on EPS of 1. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2008, as previously disclosed, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $7.4 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $4.7 million and 27, respectively. See below for further discussion regarding Management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements and a detailed presentation of the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the periods presented above.
First quarter of Fiscal 2009 total revenues were $243 million, a decrease of $9 million or 4% from $252 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, fourth quarter of Fiscal 2008 total revenues were $245 million.
First quarter of Fiscal 2009 cash provided by operating activities was $12 million or 97% of net income, compared to $8 million or 94% of net income for the same quarter last year. First quarter of Fiscal 2009 free cash flow (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) was $12 million compared to $7 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, fourth quarter of Fiscal 2008 cash provided by operating activities was $44 million or 528% of net income and free cash flow was $43 million. Black Box utilized its first quarter of Fiscal 2009 free cash flow primarily to fund current and prior period acquisition activity of $6 million, to fund debt reduction of $6 million and to pay dividends of $1 million, resulting in a $1 million decrease in its cash position. Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company.
The Company's six-month order backlog was $158 million at June 28, 2008 compared to $165 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter end comparison basis, the Company's six-month order backlog was $159 million at March 31, 2008.
For Fiscal 2009, the Company continues to target reported revenues of approximately $1.0 billion; corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of $3.30 to $3.45; and cash provided by operating activities in the range of 90% to 100% of operating net income.
All of the above exclude acquisition-related expense, stock-based compensation expense, historical stock option granting practices investigation costs and the impact of changes in the fair market value of the Company's interest-rate swap, and all of the above are before any new mergers and acquisition activity that has not been announced.

We closely monitored our cost structure during the quarter which was aligned to achieve an additional $2 to $3 million of revenues primarily in our Hotline Services. Relative to achieving our financial objectives for the year, we remain committed to improving our profitability through effective management of our cost structure consistent with expected revenue levels over the coming quarters."

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
As a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures such as free cash flow, cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments, operating net income, operating earnings per share, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating income and Same-office revenue comparisons to illustrate the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided Management explanations regarding their use and the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which are provided below.
Management uses non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and (e) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members. Moreover, the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude restructuring, severance and other acquisition integration costs (collectively referred to as "restructuring charges" or "restructuring payments") incurred during the periods reported that will impact future operating results, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, they do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (iv) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash stock-based compensation charges, which are similar to cash compensation paid to employees and are an integral part of achieving our operating results, (v) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years which is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets, (vi) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude historical stock option granting practices investigation costs, (vii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash change in fair value of the interest-rate swap which will continue to impact the Company's earnings until the interest-rate swap is settled, (viii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude expenses incurred as a result of measures taken by the Company to address the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (hereinafter referred to as "409A expenses") and (ix) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow
Free cash flow is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
Net capital expenditures
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be taken into account along with cash provided by operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures are typically material and directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.
Proceeds from stock option exercises
The Company believes that proceeds from stock option exercises should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the actual cash available to the Company. The Company has demonstrated a recurring inflow of cash related to its stock-based compensation plans and, since this cash is immediately available to the Company, it directly impacts the availability of the Company's operating cash. The amount of proceeds from stock option exercises is dependent upon a number of variables, including the number and exercise price of outstanding options and the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition,
 
Page 7
the timing of stock option exercises is under the control of the individual option holder and is not in the control of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of any proceeds from stock option exercises.
Foreign currency translation adjustment
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to U.S. dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive and / or negative impact of such charges as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in U.S. dollars.
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities plus restructuring payments. Restructuring payments are the cash payments made during the period for restructuring charges. The Company believes that restructuring payments should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the cash flow from operations.
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is presented below:
Operating net income and operating earnings per share ("EPS")
Management believes that operating net income, defined by the Company as net income plus reconciling items, and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provide investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in a way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Reconciling items include restructuring charges, amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, stock-based compensation expense, asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions, historical stock option granting practices investigation costs, the change in fair value of the interest-rate swap and 409A expenses. Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below.
The Company believes that incurring costs in the current period(s) as part of a restructuring plan or as a result of economies of scale from acquisitions will result in a long-term positive impact on financial performance in the future. Restructuring charges are presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. However, due to the material amount of additional costs incurred during a single or possibly successive periods, Management believes that exclusion of these costs and their related tax impact provides a more accurate reflection of the Company's ongoing financial performance.
Restructuring charges
Amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an
 
Page 8
acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Stock-based compensation expense
The Company records non-cash stock-based compensation expense equal to the fair value of share-based payment awards to its directors, executives and employees. Non-cash stock-based compensation is an integral part of ongoing operations since it is considered similar to other types of compensation to employees. However, Management believes that varying levels of stock-based compensation expense could result in misleading period-over-period comparisons and is providing an adjusted disclosure which excludes stock-based compensation and its related tax impact.
Asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions
The Company incurs non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years. Specifically, this non-cash expenditure is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets. Asset write-ups are depreciated over their remaining useful life which generally falls between one to five years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed from acquisition to the end of the asset's useful life, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Historical stock option granting practices investigation costs
The Company incurred significant costs in connection with its investigation of historical stock option granting practices during the current year. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Change in fair value of the interest-rate swap
To mitigate the risk of interest-rate fluctuations associated with the Company's variable rate debt, the Company entered into a five-year interest-rate swap ("interest-rate swap") that does not qualify as a cash flow hedge. Thus, the Company records the change in fair value of the interest-rate swap as an asset/liability within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with the offset to Interest expense (income) within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Management excludes this non-cash expense (income) and the related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
409A expenses
The Company incurred significant costs as a result of measures taken to address the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, related to its stock options. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, October 28, 2008 -- Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported results for the second quarter of Fiscal 2009 ended September 27, 2008.
For the second quarter of Fiscal 2009, diluted earnings per share were 82 on net income of $14.3 million or 5.6% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of 64 on net income of $11.3 million or 4.3% of revenues for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, first quarter of Fiscal 2009 diluted earnings per share were 73 on net income of $12.8 million or 5.3% of revenues. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) for the second quarter of Fiscal 2009 were 94 on operating net income (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) of $16.4 million or 6.5% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of 87 on operating net income of $15.4 million or 5.9% of revenues for the same quarter last year. Management believes that presenting operating earnings per share and operating net income is useful to investors because it provides a more meaningful comparison of the ongoing operations of the Company.
For the second quarter of Fiscal 2009, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $3.3 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $2.1 million and 12, respectively. During the second quarter of Fiscal 2008, as previously disclosed, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $6.5 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $4.1 million and 23, respectively. See below for further discussion regarding Management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements and a detailed presentation of the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the periods presented above.
Second quarter of Fiscal 2009 total revenues were $254 million, a decrease of $7 million or 3% from $261 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, first quarter of Fiscal 2009 total revenues were $243 million.
Second quarter of Fiscal 2009 cash provided by operating activities was $26 million or 182% of net income, compared to $5 million or 40% of net income for the same quarter last year. Second quarter of Fiscal 2009 free cash flow (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) was $26 million compared to $8 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, first quarter of Fiscal 2009 cash provided by operating activities was $12 million or 97% of net income and free cash flow was $12 million. Black Box utilized its second quarter of Fiscal 2009 free cash flow primarily to fund current period acquisition activity of $24 million and to pay dividends of $1 million. Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company.
For the six-month period ended September 27, 2008, diluted earnings per share were $1.55 on net income of $27.1 million or 5.5% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.10 on net income of $19.5 million or 3.8% of revenues for the same period last year. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share for the six-month period ended September 27, 2008 were $1.67 on operating net income of $29.3 million or 5.9% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of $1.60 on operating net income of $28.2 million or 5.5% of revenues for the same period last year.

For the six-month period ended September 27, 2008, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $3.4 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $2.2 million and 12, respectively. For the six-month period ended September 29, 2007, as previously disclosed, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $13.9 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $8.7 million and 50, respectively.
For the six-month period ended September 27, 2008, total revenues were $496 million, a decrease of $17 million or 3% from $513 million for the same period last year.
Cash provided by operating activities for the six-month period ended September 27, 2008 was $38 million or 141% of net income compared to $12 million or 63% of net income for the same period last year. Free cash flow was $38 million compared to $15 million for the same period last year. Black Box utilized its six-month period free cash flow primarily to fund current and prior period acquisition activity of $36 million and to pay dividends of $2 million.
The Company's six-month order backlog was $196 million at September 27, 2008 compared to $166 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter end comparison basis, the Company's six-month order backlog was $158 million at June 28, 2008.
For Fiscal 2009, the Company continues to target reported revenues of approximately $1.0 billion; corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of $3.35 to $3.45; and cash provided by operating activities in the range of 90% to 100% of operating net income.
All of the above exclude acquisition-related expense, stock-based compensation expense, historical stock option granting practices investigation costs and the impact of changes in the fair market value of the Company's interest-rate swap, and all of the above are before any new mergers and acquisition activity that has not been announced.
Commenting on the second quarter of Fiscal 2009 results, Terry Blakemore, President and Chief Executive Officer, said "Black Box's financial strength lies in our ability to generate well diversified revenues, solid sustainable margins and consistent positive cash flow. I am pleased that our revenues have remained consistent with the prior quarter with solid gains in select markets. Along with these gains, we are seeing some softness in certain sectors of our global market. Our results to date are evidence that we have successfully protected and in some cases expanded our margins across all service segments of our business in spite of the current economic conditions. The ability to preserve our margins in a challenging economic environment has been demonstrated in the past through effective cost management. Our consistent focus on margins will allow us to provide continued positive cash flow, which in challenging times, will provide Black Box with the resources to capitalize on new business opportunities."
Mr. Blakemore went on to say, "Our plan is to continue to expand our business through the acquisition of complementary enterprises, thereby enhancing our ability to provide the highest level of technical service to our clients around the world. We have demonstrated the ability to both acquire and successfully integrate companies while delivering double-digit margins and positive cash flow. So far this year we have added over $100 million in annualized revenue through acquisition funded by our low cost debt and operating cash flow. The companies that we have acquired provide a clear strategic benefit in select markets, while expanding both our capabilities and geographic footprint."
The Company will conduct a conference call beginning at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time today, October 28, 2008. Terry Blakemore, President and Chief Executive Officer, will host the call. To participate in the call, please dial 612-332-1025 approximately 15 minutes prior to the starting time and ask to be connected to the Black Box Earnings Call.

As a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures such as free cash flow, cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments, operating net income, operating earnings per share, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating income and Same-office revenue comparisons to illustrate the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided Management explanations regarding their use and the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which are provided below.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and (e) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members. Moreover, the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude restructuring, severance and other acquisition integration costs (collectively referred to as "restructuring charges" or "restructuring payments") incurred during the periods reported that will impact future operating results, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, they do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (iv) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash stock-based compensation charges, which are similar to cash compensation paid to employees and are an integral part of achieving our operating results, (v) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years which is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets, (vi) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude historical stock option granting practices investigation costs, (vii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash change in fair value of the interest-rate swap which will continue to impact the Company's earnings until the interest-rate swap is settled, (viii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude expenses incurred as a result of measures taken by the Company to address the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (hereinafter referred to as "409A expenses") and (ix) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
Free cash flow
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be taken into account along with cash provided by operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures are typically material and directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.
Net capital expenditures
The Company believes that proceeds from stock option exercises should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the actual cash available to the Company. The Company has demonstrated a recurring inflow of cash related to its stock-based compensation plans and, since this cash is immediately available to the Company, it directly impacts the availability of the Company's operating cash. The amount of proceeds from stock option exercises is dependent upon a number of variables, including the number and exercise price of outstanding options and the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the timing of stock option exercises is under the control of the individual option holder and is not in the control of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of any proceeds from stock option exercises.
Proceeds from stock option exercises
 
Page 8
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to U.S. dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive and / or negative impact of such charges as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in U.S. dollars.
Foreign currency translation adjustment
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
Management believes that operating net income, defined by the Company as net income plus reconciling items, and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provide investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in a way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Reconciling items include restructuring charges, amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, stock-based compensation expense, asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions, historical stock option granting practices investigation costs, the change in fair value of the interest-rate swap and 409A expenses. Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below.
Operating net income and operating earnings per share ("EPS")
The Company believes that incurring costs in the current period(s) as part of a restructuring plan or as a result of economies of scale from acquisitions will result in a long-term positive impact on financial performance in the future. Restructuring charges are presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. However, due to the material amount of additional costs incurred during a single or possibly successive periods, Management believes that exclusion of these costs and their related tax impact provides a more accurate reflection of the Company's ongoing financial performance.
Restructuring charges
 
Page 9
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions
The Company records non-cash stock-based compensation expense equal to the fair value of share-based payment awards to its directors, executives and employees. Non-cash stock-based compensation is an integral part of ongoing operations since it is considered similar to other types of compensation to employees. However, Management believes that varying levels of stock-based compensation expense could result in misleading period-over-period comparisons and is providing an adjusted disclosure which excludes stock-based compensation and its related tax impact.
Stock-based compensation expense
The Company incurs non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years. Specifically, this non-cash expenditure is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets. Asset write-ups are depreciated over their remaining useful life which generally falls between one to five years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed from acquisition to the end of the asset's useful life, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions
The Company incurred costs in connection with its investigation of historical stock option granting practices. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Historical stock option granting practices investigation costs
To mitigate the risk of interest-rate fluctuations associated with the Company's variable rate debt, the Company entered into a five-year interest-rate swap ("interest-rate swap") that does not qualify as a cash flow hedge. Thus, the Company records the change in fair value of the interest-rate swap as an asset/liability within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with the offset to Interest expense (income) within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Management excludes this non-cash expense (income) and the related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Change in fair value of the interest-rate swap
The Company incurred significant costs as a result of measures taken to address the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, related to its stock options. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, January 27, 2009 -- Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported results for the third quarter of Fiscal 2009 ended December 27, 2008.
For the third quarter of Fiscal 2009, diluted earnings per share were 56 on net income of $9.8 million or 3.8% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of 64 on net income of $11.3 million or 4.4% of revenues for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, second quarter of Fiscal 2009 diluted earnings per share were 82 on net income of $14.3 million or 5.6% of revenues.

Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company.
For the nine-month period ended December 27, 2008, diluted earnings per share were $2.11 on net income of $37.0 million or 4.9% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.74 on net income of $30.8 million or 4.0% of revenues for the same period last year.

Cash provided by operating activities for the nine-month period ended December 27, 2008 was $52 million or 140% of net income compared to $37 million or 119% of net income for the same period last year. Free cash flow was $49 million compared to $38 million for the same period last year. Black Box utilized its nine-month period free cash flow primarily to fund current and prior period acquisition activity of $45 million and to pay dividends of $3 million.
The Company's six-month order backlog was $195 million at December 27, 2008 compared to $165 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter end comparison basis, the Company's six-month order backlog was $196 million at September 27, 2008.
For Fiscal 2009, the Company is targeting reported revenues of approximately $990 million to $1,000 million; corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of $3.25 to $3.30; and cash provided by operating activities in the range of 90% to 100% of operating net income.
All of the above exclude acquisition-related expense, employee severance costs, stock-based compensation expense, historical stock option granting practices investigation costs and the impact of changes in the fair market value of the Company's interest-rate swap, and all of the above are before any new mergers and acquisition activity that has not been announced.
Commenting on the third quarter of Fiscal 2009 results, Terry Blakemore, President and Chief Executive Officer, said "Black Box's results for the third quarter demonstrate the strength of our business model. Our well-diversified customer base and solution offering has minimized the impact of a slowing global economy on our revenue. Our ability to effectively manage costs continues to drive double digit operating margins and our consistent positive cash flow has allowed us to continue our stated goal of making selective strategic acquisitions. With that said, we recognize that we are not immune to the decrease in corporate capital expenditures and reduced IT spending occurring throughout the economy."
Mr. Blakemore went on to say "As we enter the fourth quarter, our strong business model has positioned Black Box to meet the challenges of the expected downward pressure on our revenues. In spite of the economic uncertainties that lay ahead, our fundamental operating objectives remain unchanged, and we will continue to provide our clients with the highest levels of technical service throughout the world."

As a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures such as free cash flow, cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments (see below for reference), operating net income, operating earnings per share, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating income and Same-office revenue comparisons to illustrate the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided Management explanations regarding their use and the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which are provided below.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and (e) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members. Moreover, the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude costs for employee severance ("employee severance costs") incurred during the periods reported in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services that will impact future operating results, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain costs, incurred during the periods reported as a result of past acquisitions, including restructuring, severance and other integration costs (collectively referred to as "acquisition integration costs") that will impact future operating results, (iv) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, they do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (v) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash stock-based compensation charges, which are similar to cash compensation paid to employees and are an integral part of achieving our operating results, (vi) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years which is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets, (vii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude historical stock option granting practices investigation costs, (viii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash change in fair value of the interest-rate swap which will continue to impact the Company's earnings until the interest-rate swap is settled, (ix) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude expenses incurred as a result of measures taken by the Company to address the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (hereinafter referred to as "409A expenses") and (x) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
Free cash flow
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be taken into account along with cash provided by operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures are typically material and directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.
Net capital expenditures
 
Page 8
The Company believes that proceeds from stock option exercises should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the actual cash available to the Company. The Company has demonstrated a recurring inflow of cash related to its stock-based compensation plans and, since this cash is immediately available to the Company, it directly impacts the availability of the Company's operating cash. The amount of proceeds from stock option exercises is dependent upon a number of variables, including the number and exercise price of outstanding options and the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the timing of stock option exercises is under the control of the individual option holder and is not in the control of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of any proceeds from stock option exercises.
Proceeds from stock option exercises
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to U.S. dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive and/or negative impact of such charges as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in U.S. dollars.
Foreign currency translation adjustment
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities plus restructuring payments. Restructuring payments are the cash payments made during the period for employee severance costs and/or acquisition integration costs. The Company believes that restructuring payments should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the cash flow from operations.
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is presented below:
Management believes that operating net income, defined by the Company as net income plus reconciling items, and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provide investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in a way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Reconciling items include employee severance costs, acquisition integration costs, amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, stock-based compensation expense, asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions, historical stock option granting practices investigation costs, the change in fair value of the interest-rate swap and 409A expenses. Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below.
Operating net income and operating earnings per share ("EPS")
 
Page 9
The Company believes that incurring costs in the current period(s) in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services will result in a long-term positive impact on financial performance in the future. Employee severance costs are presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. However, due to the material amount of additional costs incurred during a single or possibly successive periods, Management believes that exclusion of these costs and their related tax impact provides a more accurate reflection of the Company's ongoing financial performance.
Employee severance costs
The Company believes that incurring costs in the current period(s) as part of a restructuring plan or as a result of economies of scale from acquisitions will result in a long-term positive impact on financial performance in the future. Acquisition integration costs are presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. However, due to the material amount of additional costs incurred during a single or possibly successive periods, Management believes that exclusion of these costs and their related tax impact provides a more accurate reflection of the Company's ongoing financial performance.
Acquisition integration costs
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions
The Company records non-cash stock-based compensation expense equal to the fair value of share-based payment awards to its directors, executives and employees. Non-cash stock-based compensation is an integral part of ongoing operations since it is considered similar to other types of compensation to employees. However, Management believes that varying levels of stock-based compensation expense could result in misleading period-over-period comparisons and is providing an adjusted disclosure which excludes stock-based compensation and its related tax impact.
Stock-based compensation expense
The Company incurs non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years. Specifically, this non-cash expenditure is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets. Asset write-ups are depreciated over their remaining useful life which generally falls between one to five years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed from acquisition to the end of the asset's useful life, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions
The Company incurred costs in connection with its investigation of historical stock option granting practices. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Historical stock option granting practices investigation costs
To mitigate the risk of interest-rate fluctuations associated with the Company's variable rate debt, the Company entered into a five-year interest-rate swap ("interest-rate swap") that does not qualify as a cash flow hedge. Thus, the Company records the change in fair value of the interest-rate swap as an asset/liability within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with the offset to Interest expense (income) within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Management excludes this non-cash expense (income) and the related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Change in fair value of the interest-rate swap
The Company incurred significant costs as a result of measures taken to address the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, related to its stock options. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.

Management believes that EBITDA, defined as income before provision for income taxes plus interest, depreciation and amortization, is a widely accepted measure of profitability that may be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Adjusted EBITDA, defined as EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense, may also be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt.

Item 5.02   Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
     (e) On May 14, 2009, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Black Box Corporation (the "Company") recommended that the Board approve, and the Board approved, an annual incentive bonus plan (the "FY10 Annual Incentive Plan") under the Black Box Corporation 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2008 Plan") for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010 ("Fiscal 2010"). The performance goals for the FY10 Annual Incentive Plan are, as defined below, "operating earnings per share," "adjusted operating margin percent," "adjusted EBITDA" and "DSOs." "Operating earnings per share" means "operating net income" divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted) with "operating net income" meaning net income plus "Reconciling Items" (as defined below); "adjusted operating margin percent" means operating income plus Reconciling Items divided by total revenues; "adjusted EBITDA" means EBITDA (net income before provision for income taxes plus interest, depreciation and amortization) plus Reconciling Items; and "DSOs" is an internal management calculation based on the balances in net accounts receivable, costs in excess of billings and billings in excess of costs at the end of the measurement period. "Reconciling Items" means employee severance costs, amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, stock-based compensation expense, asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions, costs and expenses associated with the historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters and certain other identified legal matters, the change in fair value of the interest-rate swap, pension plan funding expenses, the impact of current audits by the Internal Revenue Service and the impact of any goodwill impairment.
     The performance goals for the FY10 Annual Incentive Plan will be equally weighted. Under the FY10 Annual Incentive Plan, the achievement of the performance goals at 80% of target (90% of target for the DSOs performance goal) will result in a payout of 50% of targeted annual bonus, the achievement of the performance goals at 100% of target will result in a payout of 100% of targeted annual bonus and the achievement of the performance goals at 120% of target (110% of target for the DSOs performance goal) will result in a payout of 150% of targeted annual bonus. Following Board review and approval, the Committee made targeted annual bonus awards under the FY10 Annual Incentive Plan to the Company's executive officers as follows: R. Terry Blakemore, President and Chief Executive Officer  100% of base salary or $550,000; Michael McAndrew, Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary  80% of base salary or $252,000; and Francis W. Wertheimber, Senior Vice President  50% of base salary or $132,500. Key, non-executive employees are also participating in the FY10 Annual Incentive Plan generally on the same terms as the executive officers.
     In addition, on May 14, 2009, the Committee recommended that the Board approve, and the Board approved, a new Long-Term Incentive Program (the "FY10 LTIP") under the 2008 Plan for the two fiscal years ending March 31, 2011 (the "Performance Period"). The FY10 LTIP is comprised of a restricted stock unit grant payable in shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value $.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), representing 20% of the award, a stock option grant representing 30% of the award and a performance share award (the "Performance Award") payable in shares of the Common Stock.
 
     The restricted stock units and stock options granted pursuant to the FY10 LTIP will vest in equal increments over three years. The payout on the Performance Awards will be based on the Company's performance of (i) a cumulative adjusted EBITDA goal (the "EBITDA Goal") and (ii) the Company's total shareholder return ("TSR") relative to a peer group of companies for the Performance Period. These two (2) performance goals will be equally weighted. As a result, for purposes of determining the payout of the Performance Awards: (A) the achievement of 75% of the EBITDA Goal will result in a payout of 25% of the targeted Performance Award, the achievement of 100% of the EBITDA Goal will result in a payout of 50% of the targeted Performance Award and the achievement of 120% of the EBITDA Goal will result in a payout of 75% of the targeted Performance Award; and (B) the ranking of the Company's TSR in the 25 percentile of the peer group's TSR will result in a payout of 25% of the targeted Performance Award, the ranking of the Company's TSR at the median level of performance of the Company's TSR as compared to the Company's peer group's TSR will result in a payout of 50% of the targeted Performance Award and the ranking of the Company's TSR in the 75 percentile of the peer group's TSR will result in a payout of 75% of the targeted Performance Award.
th
th
     Following Board review and approval, the Committee approved the following awards under the FY10 LTIP to the Company's executive officers: Mr. Blakemore  a restricted stock unit award of 16,000 shares of the Common Stock, a stock option grant for 67,000 shares of the Common Stock and a Performance Award of 40,000 shares of the Common Stock; Mr. McAndrew  a restricted stock unit award of 4,000 shares of the Common Stock, a stock option grant for 17,000 shares of the Common Stock and a Performance Award of 10,000 shares of the Common Stock; and Mr. Wertheimber  a restricted stock unit award of 2,000 shares of the Common Stock, a stock option grant for 8,000 shares of the Common Stock and a Performance Award of 5,000 shares of the Common Stock. Key, non-executive employees are also participating in the FY10 LTIP generally on the same relative basis as the executive officers.
     The foregoing awards under the 2008 Plan will be granted on May 26, 2009 and the stock options will have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant.
Item 8.01   Other Events.
     The following are the cash compensation arrangements for the non-employee members of the Board as adopted by the Board on May 14, 2009, effective as of the first day of the Company's second quarter of Fiscal 2010.
 
     In addition, each non-employee director will receive, on May 26, 2009, a restricted stock unit award of 3,000 shares of the Common Stock which will immediately vest upon grant.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, May 21, 2009 -- Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported results for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009 ended March 31, 2009.
For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009, diluted earnings per share were 48 on net income of $8.4 million or 3.5% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of 48 on net income of $8.4 million or 3.4% of revenues for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, third quarter of Fiscal 2009 diluted earnings per share were 56 on net income of $9.8 million or 3.8% of revenues. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009 were 96 on operating net income (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) of $16.8 million or 6.9% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of 74 on operating net income of $13.1 million or 5.3% of revenues for the same quarter last year. Management believes that presenting operating earnings per share and operating net income is useful to investors because it provides a more meaningful comparison of the ongoing operations of the Company.
For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $12.4 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $8.4 million and 48, respectively. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2008, as previously disclosed, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $7.8 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $4.7 million and 26, respectively. See below for further discussion regarding Management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements and a detailed presentation of the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the periods presented above. Included in our fourth quarter and Fiscal 2009 results is the impact of a decrease in our annual effective tax rate from our previous estimate of 36.5% to the actual effective tax rate of 34.5%, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.8% for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009. This tax rate reduction is primarily the result of a favorable resolution of a previously-reserved Internal Revenue Service audit item. The effective tax rate reduction increased fourth quarter and Fiscal 2009 operating earnings per share by 11.
Fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009 total revenues were $241 million, a decrease of $4 million or 2% from $245 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, third quarter of Fiscal 2009 total revenues were $262 million.
Fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009 cash provided by operating activities was $20 million or 237% of net income, compared to $44 million or 529% of net income for the same quarter last year. Fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009 free cash flow (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) was $19 million compared to $43 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, third quarter of Fiscal 2009 cash provided by operating activities was $13 million or 136% of net income and free cash flow was $11 million. Black Box utilized its fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009 free cash flow primarily to fund acquisition activity of $18 million and to pay dividends of $1 million. Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company.
Fiscal 2009 diluted earnings per share were $2.59 on net income of $45.3 million or 4.5% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of $2.22 on net income of $39.2 million or 3.9% of revenues for the same period last year. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share for Fiscal 2009 were $3.51 on operating net income of $61.4 million or 6.1% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of $3.20 on operating net income of $56.5 million or 5.6% of revenues for the same period last year.
For Fiscal 2009, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $24.6 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $16.1 million and 92, respectively.

Fiscal 2009 total revenues were $1.0 billion, a decrease of $17 million or 2% from $1.02 billion for the same period last year.
Fiscal 2009 cash provided by operating activities was $72 million or 158% of net income compared to $81 million or 207% of net income for the same period last year. Free cash flow was $68 million compared to $81 million for the same period last year. Black Box utilized its Fiscal 2009 free cash flow primarily to fund current and prior period acquisition activity of $64 million and to pay dividends of $4 million.
The Company's six-month order backlog was $194 million at March 31, 2009 compared to $159 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter end comparison basis, the Company's six-month order backlog was $195 million at December 27, 2008.
For the first quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company is targeting reported revenues of approximately $220 million to $225 million and corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of 63 to 68. Included in these projections is an effective tax rate of 37.5%.
All of the above exclude acquisition-related expense, employee severance costs, historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs and the impact of changes in the fair market value of the Company's interest-rate swap, and all of the above are before any new mergers and acquisition activity that has not been announced. The Company has traditionally excluded stock-based compensation expense from its projections but will include such expenses prospectively.
Commenting on Fiscal 2009 results and the first quarter of Fiscal 2010 outlook, Terry Blakemore, President and Chief Executive Officer said, "I am pleased with Black Box's achievements for both the fourth quarter and Fiscal 2009.  Our experienced management team has been proactive in implementing financial and operational programs in this challenging economic environment. We worked with our customers to introduce our DVH solution suite into new markets and drive revenue with our innovative product offerings and world-class technical service. In addition to our top-line goals, we have and will continue to maintain our disciplined approach towards cost and expense management. While implementing headcount reductions, we have used the opportunity to create efficiencies in our organization including the consolidation of back office functions as well as real estate cost savings."
"Our focus on balance sheet management and strong positive cash flow continues to provide the resources to implement our previously-stated strategy of expanding through selective strategic acquisitions. I am confident that Black Box is well positioned to leverage its financial and operating strengths and will emerge from the current economic environment as a stronger force in the industry."

As a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures such as free cash flow, cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments (see below for reference), operating net income, operating earnings per share, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income and same-office revenue comparisons to illustrate the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided Management explanations regarding their use and the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which are provided below.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and (e) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members. Moreover, the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude costs for employee severance and facility consolidations ("employee severance and facility consolidations costs") incurred during the periods reported in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services that will impact future operating results, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain costs, incurred during the periods reported as a result of past acquisitions, including restructuring, severance and other integration costs (collectively referred to as "acquisition integration costs") that will impact future operating results, (iv) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, they do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (v) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash stock-based compensation charges, which are similar to cash compensation paid to employees and are an integral part of achieving our operating results, (vi) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years which is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets, (vii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude historical stock option granting practices investigation costs, including costs associated with the related SEC investigation, shareholder derivative lawsuit and tax matters, (viii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash change in fair value of the interest-rate swap which will continue to impact the Company's earnings until the interest-rate swap is settled, (ix) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude expenses incurred as a result of measures taken by the Company to address the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (hereinafter referred to as "409A expenses") and (x) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
Free cash flow
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be taken into account along with cash provided by operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures are typically material and directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.
Net capital expenditures
 
     
Page 8
The Company believes that proceeds from stock option exercises should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the actual cash available to the Company. The Company has demonstrated a recurring inflow of cash related to its stock-based compensation plans and, since this cash is immediately available to the Company, it directly impacts the availability of the Company's operating cash. The amount of proceeds from stock option exercises is dependent upon a number of variables, including the number and exercise price of outstanding options and the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the timing of stock option exercises is under the control of the individual option holder and is not in the control of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of any proceeds from stock option exercises.
Proceeds from stock option exercises
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to U.S. dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive and/or negative impact of such charges as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in U.S. dollars.
Foreign currency translation adjustment
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities plus restructuring payments. Restructuring payments are the cash payments made during the period for employee severance costs and/or acquisition integration costs. The Company believes that restructuring payments should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the cash flow from operations.
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is presented below:
Management believes that operating net income, defined by the Company as net income plus reconciling items, and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provide investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in a way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Reconciling items include employee severance and facility consolidation costs, acquisition integration costs, amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, stock-based compensation expense, asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions, historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs, the change in fair value of the interest-rate swap and 409A expenses. Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below.
Operating net income and operating earnings per share ("EPS")
 
     
Page 9
The Company believes that incurring costs in the current period(s) in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services will result in a long-term positive impact on financial performance in the future. Employee severance and facility consolidation costs are presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. However, due to the material amount of additional costs incurred during a single or possibly successive periods, Management believes that exclusion of these costs and their related tax impact provides a more accurate reflection of the Company's ongoing financial performance.
Employee severance and facility consolidation costs
The Company believes that incurring costs in the current period(s) as part of a restructuring plan or as a result of economies of scale from acquisitions will result in a long-term positive impact on financial performance in the future. Acquisition integration costs are presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. However, due to the material amount of additional costs incurred during a single or possibly successive periods, Management believes that exclusion of these costs and their related tax impact provides a more accurate reflection of the Company's ongoing financial performance.
Acquisition integration costs
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions
The Company records non-cash stock-based compensation expense equal to the fair value of share-based payment awards to its directors, executives and employees. Non-cash stock-based compensation is an integral part of ongoing operations since it is considered similar to other types of compensation to employees. However, Management believes that varying levels of stock-based compensation expense could result in misleading period-over-period comparisons and is providing an adjusted disclosure which excludes stock-based compensation and its related tax impact.
Stock-based compensation expense
The Company incurs non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years. Specifically, this non-cash expenditure is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets. Asset write-ups are depreciated over their remaining useful life which generally falls between one to five years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed from acquisition to the end of the asset's useful life, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions
The Company incurs costs in connection with its investigation of historical stock option granting practices, including the related SEC investigation, shareholder derivative lawsuit and tax matters. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs
To mitigate the risk of interest-rate fluctuations associated with the Company's variable rate debt, the Company entered into a five-year interest-rate swap ("interest-rate swap") that does not qualify as a cash flow hedge. Thus, the Company records the change in fair value of the interest-rate swap as an asset/liability within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with the offset to Interest expense (income) within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Management excludes this non-cash expense and the related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Change in fair value of the interest-rate swap
The Company incurred significant costs as a result of measures taken to address the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, related to its stock options. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.

Management believes that EBITDA, defined as income before provision for income taxes plus interest, depreciation and amortization, is a widely accepted measure of profitability that may be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Adjusted EBITDA, defined as EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense, may also be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, July 28, 2009 - Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported results for the first quarter of Fiscal 2010 ended June 27, 2009.
For the first quarter of Fiscal 2010, diluted earnings per share were 44 on net income of $7.8 million or 3.3% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of 73 on net income of $12.8 million or 5.3% of revenues for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009 diluted earnings per share were 48 on net income of $8.4 million or 3.5% of revenues. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) for the first quarter of Fiscal 2010 were 71 on operating net income (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) of $12.4 million or 5.3% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of 72 on operating net income of $12.5 million or 5.2% of revenues for the same quarter last year. See below for additional information regarding the comparability of Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009 operating earnings per share. Management believes that presenting operating earnings per share and operating net income is useful to investors because it provides a more meaningful comparison of the ongoing operations of the Company.
For the first quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $7.4 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $4.6 million and 27, respectively. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2009, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were ($0.5) million with an after-tax impact on EPS of (1). See below for further discussion regarding Management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements and a detailed presentation of the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the periods presented above.
First quarter of Fiscal 2010 total revenues were $235 million, a decrease of $8 million or 3% from $243 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009 total revenues were $241 million.
First quarter of Fiscal 2010 cash provided by operating activities was $16 million or 206% of net income, compared to $12 million or 97% of net income for the same quarter last year. First quarter of Fiscal 2010 free cash flow (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) was $16 million compared to $12 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009 cash provided by operating activities was $20 million or 237% of net income and free cash flow was $19 million. Black Box utilized its first quarter of Fiscal 2010 free cash flow primarily to fund debt reduction of $12 million and to pay dividends of $1 million. Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company.
The Company's six-month order backlog was $210 million at June 27, 2009 compared to $158 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter end comparison basis, the Company's six-month order backlog was $194 million at March 31, 2009.
For the second quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company is targeting reported revenues of approximately $230 million to $235 million and corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of 65 to 70. Included in these projections is an effective tax rate of 37.5%.
All of the above exclude acquisition-related expense, employee severance and facility consolidations costs, historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs, current legal matters costs and the impact of changes in the fair market value of the Company's interest-rate swaps, and all of the above are before any new mergers and acquisition activity that has not been announced.

Commenting on the first quarter of Fiscal 2010 results and the second quarter of Fiscal 2010 outlook, Terry Blakemore, President and Chief Executive Officer said "Black Box's broad product offering and world-class technical service continue to provide the communication solutions to serve our current customers and win new business - even in challenging economic times.  In an environment where there are fewer revenue opportunities, we continue to proactively manage our cost structure to ensure continued profitability and positive cash flow.  The disciplined management of our operational and financial resources allowed us to reduce our debt this quarter while we continue to evaluate selective strategic acquisitions."
"I am confident that our experienced management team and customer focus will allow us to maximize revenue by serving our loyal customers and capitalizing on new opportunities as the economy improves."

As a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures such as free cash flow, cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments (see below for reference), operating net income, operating earnings per share, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income and same-office revenue comparisons to illustrate the Company's operational performance.

The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, they do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years which is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets, (iv) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash change in fair value of the Company's interest-rate swaps which will continue to impact the Company's earnings until the interest-rate swaps are settled, (v) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude costs for employee severance and facility consolidations ("employee severance and facility consolidations costs") incurred during the periods reported in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services that will impact future operating results, (vi) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs, including costs associated with the related SEC investigation, shareholder derivative lawsuit, tax matters and insurance/indemnification matters, (vii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude costs, including settlement or resolution, arising from current legal matters associated with the ongoing operations of the Company ("current legal matters costs") and (viii) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
Free cash flow
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be taken into account along with cash provided by operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures are typically material and directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.
Net capital expenditures
 
Page 7     
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to U.S. dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive and/or negative impact of such charges as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in U.S. dollars.
Foreign currency translation adjustment
The Company believes that proceeds from stock option exercises should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the actual cash available to the Company. The Company has demonstrated a recurring inflow of cash related to its stock-based compensation plans and, since this cash is immediately available to the Company, it directly impacts the availability of the Company's operating cash. The amount of proceeds from stock option exercises is dependent upon a number of variables, including the number and exercise price of outstanding options and the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the timing of stock option exercises is under the control of the individual option holder and is not in the control of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of any proceeds from stock option exercises.
Proceeds from stock option exercises
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities plus restructuring payments. Restructuring payments are the cash payments made during the period for employee severance and facility consolidations costs. The Company believes that restructuring payments should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the cash flow from operations.
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is presented below:
Management believes that operating net income, defined by the Company as net income plus reconciling items, and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provide investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in a way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Reconciling items include amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions, the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps, employee severance and facility consolidation costs, historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs and current legal matters costs. Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below.
Operating net income and operating earnings per share ("EPS")
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions
 
Page 8     
The Company incurs non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years. Specifically, this non-cash expenditure is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets. Asset write-ups are depreciated over their remaining useful life which generally falls between one to five years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed from acquisition to the end of the asset's useful life, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions
To mitigate the risk of interest-rate fluctuations associated with the Company's variable rate debt, the Company entered into two separate interest-rate swaps ("interest-rate swaps") that do not qualify as a cash flow hedge. Thus, the Company records the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps as an asset/liability within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with the offset to Interest expense (income) within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Management excludes this non-cash expense and the related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps
The Company believes that incurring costs in the current period(s) in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services will result in a long-term positive impact on financial performance in the future. Employee severance and facility consolidation costs are presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. However, due to the amount of additional costs incurred during a single or possibly successive periods, Management believes that exclusion of these costs and their related tax impact provides a more accurate reflection of the Company's ongoing financial performance.
Employee severance and facility consolidation costs
The Company incurs costs in connection with its investigation of historical stock option granting practices, including the related SEC investigation, shareholder derivative lawsuit, tax matters and insurance/indemnification matters. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs
The Company incurs costs arising from current legal matters associated with the ongoing operations of the Company. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Current legal matters costs
During Fiscal 2009, the Company excluded stock-based compensation expense when evaluating the continuing operations of the Company. Beginning with the first quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company will not exclude such expenses. For comparability purposes only, the Company has restated reconciling items, operating net income and operating EPS for the first and fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009 to reflect this change in presentation.
Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009 comparability
For the first quarter of Fiscal 2010, stock-based compensation expense was $1,643 with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $1,027 and 6, respectively. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009, stock-based compensation expense was $805 with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $543 and 3, respectively. For the first quarter of Fiscal 2009, stock-based compensation expense was $542 with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $344 and 2, respectively.

Management believes that EBITDA, defined as income before provision for income taxes plus interest, depreciation and amortization, is a widely accepted measure of profitability that may be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Adjusted EBITDA, defined as EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense, may also be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Stock-based compensation is an integral part of ongoing operations since it is considered similar to other types of compensation to employees. However, Management believes that varying levels of stock-based compensation expense could result in misleading period-over-period comparisons and is providing an adjusted disclosure which excludes stock-based compensation.

See above for additional details provided by Management regarding non-GAAP financial measures.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, October 27, 2009 - Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported results for the second quarter of Fiscal 2010 ended September 26, 2009.
For the second quarter of Fiscal 2010, diluted earnings per share were 47 on net income of $8.2 million or 3.5% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of 82 on net income of $14.3 million or 5.6% of revenues for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, first quarter of Fiscal 2010 diluted earnings per share were 44 on net income of $7.8 million or 3.3% of revenues. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) for the second quarter of Fiscal 2010 were 72 on operating net income (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) of $12.7 million or 5.5% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of 91 on operating net income of $15.9 million or 6.3% of revenues for the same quarter last year. See below for additional information regarding the comparability of Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009 operating earnings per share. Management believes that presenting operating earnings per share and operating net income is useful to investors because it provides a more meaningful comparison of the ongoing operations of the Company.
For the second quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $7.2 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $4.5 million and 25, respectively. Included in the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the second quarter of Fiscal 2010 is a pre-tax charge of $4.0 million recorded in connection with an agreement in principle for settlement of the previously-disclosed pending shareholder derivative lawsuit and related matters arising out of the Company's review of its historical stock option practices. This item is reported in the "Historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs" line item within the Company's pre-tax reconciling items table below. This settlement is subject to the execution of documentation regarding the settlement as well as court approval. During the second quarter of Fiscal 2009, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $2.5 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $1.6 million and 9, respectively. See below for further discussion regarding Management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements and a detailed presentation of the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the periods presented above.
Second quarter of Fiscal 2010 total revenues were $232 million, a decrease of $22 million or 9% from $254 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, first quarter of Fiscal 2010 total revenues were $235 million.
Second quarter of Fiscal 2010 cash provided by operating activities was $14 million or 177% of net income, compared to $26 million or 182% of net income for the same quarter last year. Second quarter of Fiscal 2010 free cash flow (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) was $14 million compared to $26 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, first quarter of Fiscal 2010 cash provided by operating activities was $16 million or 206% of net income and free cash flow was $16 million. Black Box utilized its second quarter of Fiscal 2010 free cash flow primarily to fund debt reduction of $13 million and to pay dividends of $1 million. Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company.
For the six-month period ended September 26, 2009, diluted earnings per share were 91 on net income of $16.0 million or 3.4% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.55 on net income of $27.1 million or 5.5% of revenues for the same period last year. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share for the six-month period ended September 26, 2009 were $1.43 on operating net income of $25.1 million or 5.4% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of $1.62 on operating net income of $28.4 million or 5.7% of revenues for the same period last year.

For the six-month period ended September 26, 2009, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $14.5 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $9.1 million and 52, respectively. For the six-month period ended September 27, 2008, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $2.0 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $1.3 million and 7, respectively.
For the six-month period ended September 26, 2009, total revenues were $467 million, a decrease of $29 million or 6% from $496 million for the same period last year.
Cash provided by operating activities for the six-month period ended September 26, 2009 was $31 million or 191% of net income compared to $38 million or 141% of net income for the same period last year. Free cash flow was $30 million compared to $38 million for the same period last year. Black Box utilized its six-month period free cash flow primarily to fund debt reduction of $27 million and to pay dividends of $2 million.
The Company's six-month order backlog was $207 million at September 26, 2009 compared to $196 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter-end comparison basis, the Company's six-month order backlog was $210 million at June 27, 2009.
For the third quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company is targeting reported revenues of approximately $235 million to $240 million and corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of 70 to 75. Included in these projections is an effective tax rate of 37.5%.
All of the above exclude acquisition-related expense, employee severance and facility consolidations costs, historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs, current legal matters costs and the impact of changes in the fair market value of the Company's interest-rate swaps, and all of the above are before any new mergers and acquisition activity that has not been announced.
Commenting on the second quarter of Fiscal 2010 results and the third quarter of Fiscal 2010 outlook, Terry Blakemore, President and Chief Executive Officer said "I am very pleased with another solid quarter of performance by the Black Box team.  Our commercial markets are beginning to show signs of stabilization, while our government markets continue to grow.   The Black Box business model is consistently providing strong margins and cash flow which position us to take full advantage of the expected economic recovery."  
"Our team continues to deliver world-class technical support and solutions to our global clients.  Although we have made further adjustments to right-size our cost structure, we remain focused on superior service and response."

As a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures such as free cash flow, cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments (see below for reference), operating net income, operating earnings per share, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income and same-office revenue comparisons to illustrate the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided Management explanations regarding their use and the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which are provided below.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and (e) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members. Moreover, the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, they do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years which is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets, (iv) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash change in fair value of the Company's interest-rate swaps which will continue to impact the Company's earnings until the interest-rate swaps are settled, (v) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude costs for employee severance and facility consolidations ("employee severance and facility consolidations costs") incurred during the periods reported in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services that will impact future operating results, (vi) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs, including costs associated with the related SEC investigation, shareholder derivative lawsuit, tax matters and insurance/indemnification matters, (vii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude costs of settlement or resolution arising from current legal matters associated with the ongoing operations of the Company ("current legal matters costs") and (viii) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, plus proceeds from stock option exercises. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
Free cash flow
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be taken into account along with cash provided by operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures are typically material and directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.
Net capital expenditures
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to U.S. dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive and/or negative impact of such charges as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in U.S. dollars.
Foreign currency exchange impact on cash
 
Page 8
The Company believes that proceeds from stock option exercises should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the actual cash available to the Company. The Company has demonstrated a recurring inflow of cash related to its stock-based compensation plans and, since this cash is immediately available to the Company, it directly impacts the availability of the Company's operating cash. The amount of proceeds from stock option exercises is dependent upon a number of variables, including the number and exercise price of outstanding options and the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the timing of stock option exercises is under the control of the individual option holder and is not in the control of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of any proceeds from stock option exercises.

A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities plus restructuring payments. Restructuring payments are the cash payments made during the period for employee severance and facility consolidations costs. The Company believes that restructuring payments should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the cash flow from operations.

A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is presented below:
Management believes that operating net income, defined by the Company as net income plus reconciling items, and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provide investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in a way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Reconciling items include amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions, the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps, employee severance and facility consolidation costs, historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs and current legal matters costs. Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below.
Operating net income and operating earnings per share ("EPS")
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions
 
Page 9
The Company incurs non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years. Specifically, this non-cash expenditure is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets. Asset write-ups are depreciated over their remaining useful life which generally falls between one to five years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed from acquisition to the end of the asset's useful life and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.

To mitigate the risk of interest-rate fluctuations associated with the Company's variable rate debt, the Company entered into two separate interest-rate swaps ("interest-rate swaps") that do not qualify as a cash flow hedge. Thus, the Company records the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps as an asset/liability within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with the offset to Interest expense (income) within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Management excludes this non-cash expense and the related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps
The Company believes that incurring costs in the current period(s) in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services will result in a long-term positive impact on financial performance in the future. Employee severance and facility consolidation costs are presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. However, due to the amount of additional costs incurred during a single or possibly successive periods, Management believes that exclusion of these costs and their related tax impact provides a more accurate reflection of the Company's ongoing financial performance.
Employee severance and facility consolidation costs
The Company incurs costs in connection with its investigation of historical stock option granting practices, including the related SEC investigation, shareholder derivative lawsuit, tax matters and insurance/indemnification matters. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management. During 2Q10, the Company recorded $4.0 million for the settlement of all matters related to the shareholder derivative lawsuit and related matters. The Company expects the cash payment will be made during the second half of Fiscal 2010.
Historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs
The Company incurs costs arising from current legal matters associated with the ongoing operations of the Company. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Current legal matters costs
During Fiscal 2009, the Company excluded stock-based compensation expense when evaluating the continuing operations of the Company. Beginning with the first quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company will not exclude such expenses. For comparability purposes only, the Company has restated reconciling items, operating net income and operating EPS for the second quarter and second quarter year-to-date Fiscal 2009 to reflect this change in presentation.

A reconciliation of diluted EPS to operating EPS is presented below:
Management believes that EBITDA, defined as income before provision for income taxes plus interest, depreciation and amortization, is a widely accepted measure of profitability that may be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Adjusted EBITDA, defined as EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense, may also be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Stock-based compensation is an integral part of ongoing operations since it is considered similar to other types of compensation to employees. However, Management believes that varying levels of stock-based compensation expense could result in misleading period-over-period comparisons and is providing an adjusted disclosure which excludes stock-based compensation.

Supplemental Information
Management is presented with and reviews revenues, operating income and adjusted operating income by geographical segment. Adjusted operating income is defined by the Company as operating income plus reconciling items. Reconciling items include intangible assets on acquisitions, asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions, employee severance and facility consolidation costs, historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs and current legal matters costs. See above for additional details provided by Management regarding non-GAAP financial measures. Revenues, operating income and adjusted operating income for North America, Europe and All Other are presented below:
Geographical Segment Results
During Fiscal 2009, the Company excluded stock-based compensation expense when evaluating the continuing operations of the Company. Beginning with the first quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company will not exclude such expenses. For comparability purposes only, the Company has restated reconciling items (pretax) and adjusted operating income for the second quarter and year-to-date Fiscal 2009 to reflect this change in presentation. The Company incurred stock-based compensation expense of $1,636, $840, $1,643, $3,279 and $1,382 during the second quarter of Fiscal 2010 and 2009, first quarter of Fiscal 2010 and second quarter year-to-date Fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, January 26, 2010 - Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported results for the third quarter of Fiscal 2010 ended December 26, 2009.
For the third quarter of Fiscal 2010, diluted earnings per share were 63 on net income of $11.0 million or 4.3% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of 56 on net income of $9.8 million or 3.8% of revenues for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, second quarter of Fiscal 2010 diluted earnings per share were 47 on net income of $8.2 million or 3.5% of revenues. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) for the third quarter of Fiscal 2010 were 77 on operating net income (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) of $13.6 million or 5.4% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of 85 on operating net income of $14.9 million or 5.7% of revenues for the same quarter last year. See below for additional information regarding the comparability of Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009 operating earnings per share. Management believes that presenting operating earnings per share and operating net income is useful to investors because it provides a more meaningful comparison of the ongoing operations of the Company.
For the third quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $4.1 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $2.6 million and 14, respectively. During the third quarter of Fiscal 2009, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $7.9 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $5.0 million and 29, respectively. See below for further discussion regarding Management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements and a detailed presentation of the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the periods presented above.
Third quarter of Fiscal 2010 total revenues were $253 million, a decrease of $9 million or 3% from $262 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, second quarter of Fiscal 2010 total revenues were $232 million.
Third quarter of Fiscal 2010 cash provided by operating activities was $12 million or 105% of net income, compared to $13 million or 136% of net income for the same quarter last year. Third quarter of Fiscal 2010 free cash flow (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) was $11 million equivalent to $11 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, second quarter of Fiscal 2010 cash provided by operating activities was $14 million or 177% of net income and free cash flow was $14 million. Black Box utilized its third quarter of Fiscal 2010 free cash flow primarily to fund acquisition activity of $10 million and to pay dividends of $1 million. Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company.
For the nine-month period ended December 26, 2009, diluted earnings per share were $1.54 on net income of $27.0 million or 3.7% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of $2.11 on net income of $37.0 million or 4.9% of revenues for the same period last year. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share for the nine-month period ended December 26, 2009 were $2.20 on operating net income of $38.6 million or 5.4% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of $2.47 on operating net income of $43.3 million or 5.7% of revenues for the same period last year.
For the nine-month period ended December 26, 2009, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $18.6 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $11.6 million and 66, respectively. For the nine-month period ended December 27, 2008, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $9.9 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $6.3 million and 36, respectively.

For the nine-month period ended December 26, 2009, total revenues were $721 million, a decrease of $37 million or 5% from $758 million for the same period last year.
Cash provided by operating activities for the nine-month period ended December 26, 2009 was $42 million or 156% of net income compared to $52 million or 140% of net income for the same period last year. Free cash flow was $41 million compared to $49 million for the same period last year. Black Box utilized its nine-month period free cash flow primarily to fund acquisition activity of $18 million, debt reduction of $14 million and to pay dividends of $3 million.
The Company's six-month order backlog was $191 million at December 26, 2009 compared to $195 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter-end comparison basis, the Company's six-month order backlog was $207 million at September 26, 2009.
For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company is targeting reported revenues of approximately $240 million to $245 million and corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of 73 to 78. Included in these projections is an effective tax rate of 37.5%.
All of the above exclude acquisition-related expense, employee severance and facility consolidations costs, historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs, current legal matters costs and the impact of changes in the fair market value of the Company's interest-rate swaps, and all of the above are before any new mergers and acquisition activity that has not been announced.
Commenting on the third quarter of Fiscal 2010 results and the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010 outlook, Terry Blakemore, President and Chief Executive Officer said "Our third quarter performance continues to strengthen the Black Box position for growth as the economy recovers."
"We achieved sequential organic revenue growth and solid operational cash flow, increased our world-class technical capabilities through a strategic acquisition and expanded our served market through our new distribution agreement with Avaya. As the economy improves, the Black Box comprehensive portfolio of communication and service offerings will provide our clients with the critical infrastructure they need to grow."

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
As a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures such as free cash flow, cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments (see below for reference), operating net income, operating earnings per share, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income and same-office revenue comparisons to illustrate the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided Management explanations regarding their use and the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which are provided below.
Management uses non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and (e) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members. Moreover, the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, they do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years which is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets, (iv) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash change in fair value of the Company's interest-rate swaps which will continue to impact the Company's earnings until the interest-rate swaps are settled, (v) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude costs for employee severance and facility consolidations ("employee severance and facility consolidations costs") incurred during the periods reported in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services that will impact future operating results, (vi) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs, including costs associated with the related Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") investigation, shareholder derivative lawsuit, tax matters and insurance/indemnification matters, (vii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude costs of settlement or resolution arising from current legal matters associated with the ongoing operations of the Company ("current legal matters costs") and (viii) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow
Free cash flow is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, plus proceeds from stock option exercises. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
Net capital expenditures
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be taken into account along with cash provided by operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures are typically material and directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.
Foreign currency exchange impact on cash
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to U.S. dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive and/or negative impact of such charges as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in U.S. dollars.
 
     
Page 8
Proceeds from stock option exercises
The Company believes that proceeds from stock option exercises should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the actual cash available to the Company. The Company has demonstrated a recurring inflow of cash related to its stock-based compensation plans and, since this cash is immediately available to the Company, it directly impacts the availability of the Company's operating cash. The amount of proceeds from stock option exercises is dependent upon a number of variables, including the number and exercise price of outstanding options and the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the timing of stock option exercises is under the control of the individual option holder and is not in the control of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of any proceeds from stock option exercises.
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities plus restructuring payments. Restructuring payments are the cash payments made during the period for employee severance and facility consolidation costs. The Company believes that restructuring payments should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the cash flow from operations.
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is presented below:
Operating net income and operating earnings per share ("EPS")
Management believes that operating net income, defined by the Company as net income plus reconciling items, and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provide investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in a way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Reconciling items include amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions, the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps, employee severance and facility consolidation costs, historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs and current legal matters costs. Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below.
Amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions
The Company incurs non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years. Specifically, this non-cash expenditure is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets. Asset write-
 
     
Page 9
ups are depreciated over their remaining useful life which generally falls between one to five years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed from acquisition to the end of the asset's useful life and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps
To mitigate the risk of interest-rate fluctuations associated with the Company's variable rate debt, the Company entered into two separate interest-rate swaps ("interest-rate swaps") that do not qualify as a cash flow hedge. Thus, the Company records the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps as an asset/liability within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with the offset to Interest expense (income) within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Management excludes this non-cash expense and the related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Employee severance and facility consolidation costs
The Company believes that incurring costs in the current period(s) in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services will result in a long-term positive impact on financial performance in the future. Employee severance and facility consolidation costs are presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. However, due to the amount of additional costs incurred during a single or possibly successive periods, Management believes that exclusion of these costs and their related tax impact provides a more accurate reflection of the Company's ongoing financial performance.
Historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs
The Company incurs costs in connection with its investigation of historical stock option granting practices, including the related SEC investigation, shareholder derivative lawsuit, tax matters and insurance/indemnification matters. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Current legal matters costs
The Company incurs costs arising from current legal matters associated with the ongoing operations of the Company. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009 comparability
During Fiscal 2009, the Company excluded stock-based compensation expense when evaluating the continuing operations of the Company. Beginning with the first quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company will not exclude such expenses. For comparability purposes only, the Company has restated reconciling items, operating net income and operating EPS for the third quarter and third quarter year-to-date Fiscal 2009 to reflect this change in presentation.
Information on stock-based compensation expense and its after-tax impact on net income and EPS is presented below:

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
Management believes that EBITDA, defined as income before provision for income taxes plus interest, depreciation and amortization, is a widely accepted measure of profitability that may be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Adjusted EBITDA, defined as EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense, may also be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Stock-based compensation is an integral part of ongoing operations since it is considered similar to other types of compensation to employees. However, Management believes that varying levels of stock-based compensation expense could result in misleading period-over-period comparisons and is providing an adjusted disclosure which excludes stock-based compensation.

Item 8.01   Other Events.
     As previously disclosed, in November 2006, two stockholder derivative lawsuits were filed against Black Box Corporation (the "Company") itself, as a nominal defendant, and several of the Company's current and former officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania (the "District Court"). The two substantially identical stockholder derivative complaints allege that the individual defendants improperly backdated and/or benefitted from grants of stock options in violation of the Company's stockholder-approved stock option plans during the period 1996-2002, improperly recorded and accounted for backdated stock options in violation of generally accepted accounting principles, improperly took tax deductions based on backdated stock options in violation of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, produced and disseminated false financial statements and Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filings to the Company's stockholders and to the market that improperly recorded and accounted for the backdated option grants, concealed the alleged improper backdating of stock options and obtained substantial benefits from sales of Company stock while in the possession of material inside information. The complaints sought damages on behalf of the Company against certain current and former officers and directors and allege breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, securities law violations and other claims. The two lawsuits were consolidated into a single action as In re Black Box Corporation Derivative Litigation, Master File No. 2:06-CV-1531 JFC, and plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated stockholder derivative complaint on August 31, 2007 (the "Action"). During the second quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010 ("Fiscal 2010"), an agreement in principle for settlement of the Action and related matters arising out of the Company's review of its historical stock option practices was achieved. During the third quarter of Fiscal 2010, certain of the parties to the Action and certain insurers entered into a Memorandum of Understanding regarding settlement of the Action and related matters. On January 22, 2010, the parties to the Action and certain insurers executed a Stipulation of Compromise and Settlement (the "Stipulation") and the parties to the Action executed a Joint Motion for Preliminary and Final Approval of Proposed Settlement (the "Joint Motion"), and such documents were filed with the District Court. On January 27, 2010, the District Court entered an order preliminarily approving the proposed settlement and setting forth a process and scheduling a hearing for consideration of final approval of the proposed settlement (the "Preliminary Order").
     Pursuant to the Preliminary Order, the Company is required to file with the SEC the Notice of Proposed Settlement of Derivative Action and of Settlement Hearing attached hereto as Exhibit 99.4 (the "Notice") and the Stipulation attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2. Also pursuant to the Preliminary Order, the Company will issue a press release including the Notice. The Company is also filing with this Form 8-K the Joint Motion, the Preliminary Order and a proposed Order of Dismissal and Judgment.
     The proposed settlement remains subject to final approval of the District Court.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Table of Contents

Exhibit 99.1
     The Parties hereby move the Court pursuant to 23.1 for an order preliminarily approving the proposed settlement reached in the above-captioned action (the "Action") brought derivatively for and on behalf of Nominal Defendant Black Box Corporation ("Black Box" or the "Company") against the Defendants and, after notice and hearing, for final approval of the Settlement.
1
Fed. R. Civ. P.
          1. The Parties have agreed on the Settlement, including the settlement of all claims that John L. Anderson and Steve Leisy (collectively, the "Plaintiffs") have brought derivatively against the Defendants.
          2. Black Box and its former chief executive officer, Defendant Frederick C. Young ("Young"), also have agreed to settle claims between them. The Young claims are the basis of a lawsuit Young filed against Black Box in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania (the "CCP Action"). Black Box's claims against Young and the Young
 
 
claims against Black Box would have been asserted in this Action if it had proceeded to and beyond the responsive pleading or motion stage.
          3. All terms, definitions, provisions, reservations, and conditions of such Settlement are more particularly set forth in the Stipulation which is attached hereto as Exhibit A. To the extent that there may be any conflict between the terms, definitions, provisions, reservations, and conditions set forth in this Joint Motion and those set forth in the Stipulation, the terms, definitions, provisions, reservations, and conditions of the Stipulation shall govern.
          4. The purposes and intent of all parties to this Joint Motion are that, subject to the final approval of the Court, (i) the Action, the CCP Action, and the Released Claims shall be finally and fully compromised, settled, and released; and (ii) the Action and the CCP Action shall be dismissed with prejudice, as to all Parties, upon and subject to the terms and conditions of the Stipulation. The Released Claims include all claims in the Action, all claims in the CCP Action, all claims between the Company and Frederick C. Young, all claims between or among any of the Defendants, and all claims between any of the Parties and the Insurers.
          5. In accordance with the provisions of the Stipulation, the Parties hereby move the Court to confirm the Settlement Hearing scheduled for March 19, 2010, at which time (a) the Parties will seek final approval of the terms of the Settlement as fair, reasonable, and adequate, and in the best interests of, Black Box and Current Black Box Stockholders; and (b) Plaintiffs' Counsel will seek an award of attorneys' fees and expenses in the amount of $1,600,000 (the "Fee Award"), to be paid by Black Box and which is unopposed by Defendants, to be awarded to Plaintiffs' Counsel as fair and reasonable in light of the substantial benefits conferred on Black Box and Current Black Box Stockholders by the Settlement.
 
          6. The Mediating Parties agree and represent that the Stipulation, the Settlement, and the Fee Award were extensively negotiated at arm's-length in good faith by the Mediating Parties with the assistance of a very experienced mediator of complex issues, and reflect an agreement that was reached voluntarily among all the Parties after consultation with experienced, sophisticated legal counsel.
          7. The Parties suggest that the factors favoring the Settlement on the terms proposed in the Stipulation include the following:
          a. the uncertainty of the legal issues underlying the allegations in the Action;
  b. the assurance that Black Box and Current Black Box Stockholders obtained benefits regardless of the outcome of further litigation;
          c. the economy of costs/exposure reduction for the benefit of the Parties;
          d. the costs of continued litigation; and
  e. the prevailing consideration in all compromises and settlements that the Parties weighed the advantages and benefits of settlement against the risks of loss.
          8. The Parties further represent to the Court that while the Defendants have denied, and continue to deny, the allegations in the Action, and Young and Black Box deny and continue to deny their claims against each other, the Stipulation, the Settlement, and the consideration therefor are fair, reasonable, and adequate, and in the best interests of, Black Box and Current Black Box Stockholders, considering:
          a. the complexity, expense, and likely duration of the litigation with respect to the further participation of the Parties;
          b. the state of the proceedings and the amount of discovery completed;
          c. the immediate benefits to Black Box and Current Black Box Stockholders arising out of the Settlement; and
          d. the concurrences of counsel for the Parties and the Insurers as reflected in their respective signatures to this Joint Motion.
 
          9. Plaintiffs' Counsel represent to the Court that, in their opinion, the Settlement as proposed is fair, reasonable, and adequate, and in the best interests of, Black Box and Current Black Box Stockholders, especially in view of the uncertainties and vagaries of further litigation, the substantial and immediate benefits obtained for the Company and for Current Black Box Stockholders, and the nature of the relief sought.
          10. In accordance with the provisions of the Stipulation, Counsel present for the approval of the Court the following proposed plan:
   a.   Following the Court's determination that the Settlement is preliminarily approved and entry of the Preliminary Approval order, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, Notice to all Current Black Box Stockholders, substantially in the form attached to this Joint Motion as Exhibit C, shall be disseminated by release one time on the national edition of and the Notice and the Stipulation will be exhibits to a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by Black Box, informing Current Black Box Stockholders of their right to object to the terms of the proposed Settlement and to be heard on their objections at the Settlement Hearing to be conducted at a prescribed time and place and in a prescribed manner.
Business Wire
   b.   The Settlement Hearing shall be conducted in such manner as to assure full compliance with applicable considerations of due process of law and the provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
          11. To assure that Current Black Box Stockholders are fully informed of (a) the proposed Settlement, (b) their rights to review the proposed Settlement documents, (c) their right to object to the proposed Settlement, and (d) the means whereby they may make their objections and be heard thereon at the Settlement Hearing to be held by the Court at a designated time and place, the Parties respectfully request that the Notice be approved by the Court and published, as provided in the Stipulation, in accordance with due process and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Black Box shall be responsible for publishing the Notice and all costs associated therewith in accordance with the terms of the Stipulation.
 
          12. To facilitate the proposed Settlement and in the interests of judicial economy, the Parties request that the commencement and/or prosecution of any and all related actions and proceedings asserting any Released Claims against any Released Parties (including discovery) by, on behalf of, or through any Current Black Box Stockholders in their capacity as such (excluding, however, those proceedings within the Action necessary to obtain final approval of the Settlement embodied in the Stipulation), should be enjoined and stayed during the pendency of these Settlement proceedings and until further ordered by this Court.
          13. As described in the Stipulation, the Parties agree that, in the event of termination of the Stipulation, the Action shall revert to its status before the filing of the Stipulation as if related orders and papers and the efforts leading to the Stipulation had not been entered, prepared, or taken.
          14. The Parties agree that the Court shall retain jurisdiction with respect to the implementation and enforcement of the terms of the Stipulation and Settlement, and all Parties submit to the jurisdiction of the Court for the sole purpose of implementing and enforcing the Settlement embodied in the Stipulation. By submitting to the jurisdiction of the Court for the limited purpose of this Settlement, the Defendants do not waive, and shall not be deemed to have waived, any jurisdictional defenses that were otherwise available prior to the execution of the Stipulation.
     
WHEREFORE, THE PARTIES REQUEST:
 
 
       IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused the Joint Motion to be submitted, by their duly authorized attorneys.

II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
     2.1 The Anderson Action was filed on November 16, 2006, and was brought as a derivative action on behalf of Black Box.
     2.2 The Leisy Action was filed on November 17, 2006, and was brought as a derivative action on behalf of Black Box.
     2.3 The Court consolidated the Anderson Action and the Leisy Action into the Action on December 15, 2006 and appointed Plaintiffs' Counsel, Barroway Topaz Kessler Meltzer & Check, LLP and the Weiser Law Firm, P.C., as Co-Lead Counsel, and the Law Offices of Alfred G. Yates, Jr. PC as Liaison Counsel on January 4, 2007.
     2.4 The Action was purportedly brought on behalf of Nominal Defendant Black Box and alleged improprieties in Black Box's stock option practices and sought recovery on behalf of the Company from Young, Baird, and the Individual Defendants.
     2.5 On November 13, 2006, the SEC informed the Company of the SEC Investigation.
 
     2.6 On November 16, 2006, in a Current Report on Form 8-K, the Company disclosed the existence of the SEC Investigation, and, on November 17, 2006, in a Current Report on Form 8-K, disclosed the filing of the Anderson Action.
     2.7 The Company promptly engaged outside counsel, announced its intention to cooperate with the SEC Investigation and, under the direction of the Audit Committee, quickly launched the Audit Committee Review.
     2.8 On March 20, 2007, the Company issued a press release in which it stated that "the exercise price of certain stock option grants differed from the fair market value of the underlying shares on the appropriate measurement date" and the Company would need to restate its previously-issued financial statements.
     2.9 On May 22, 2007, Black Box announced that, on May 20, 2007, Young, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, President, and a member of its Board, had resigned from his positions with the Company.
     2.10 On August 13, 2007, the Company filed its 2007 Form 10-K, which included a statement on the findings of the Audit Committee Review, in which the Company stated that there were measurement date problems with certain of the Company's historical stock option grants and stated that, as a result, Black Box would need to record approximately $71.5 million in previously unrecorded compensation expenses to correct certain of its historical financial statements.
     2.11 In the 2007 Form 10-K, the Company stated that the Board had determined that Young could have been terminated due to "Cause for Termination" (as that term is defined in the Young Agreement) at the time Young resigned as a director and officer of the Company on May 20, 2007.
 
     2.12 The Company concluded that one effect of the Board's Cause for Termination determination was that all of Young's outstanding stock options terminated as of the date of his resignation, May 20, 2007, pursuant to the terms of the Young Agreement and the underlying grant agreements.
     2.13 Subsequent to the Board's Cause for Termination determination, Young asserted the Young Claims.
     2.14 On November 21, 2007, Young commenced the CCP Action and requested certain information from Black Box.
     2.15 The Black Box Claims, the Young Claims, the claims set forth in the Action, and other matters were the subject of the Mediation.
     2.16 Beginning in the summer of 2007 and continuing throughout the course of the Action and the CCP Action, counsel for Plaintiffs, the Company, Young, Baird, and several Individual Defendants have had numerous lengthy discussions, both telephonic and in person, regarding the Action, the CCP Action, and possible settlement of the direct and derivative claims among Young, Baird, the Individual Defendants, and the Company.
     2.17 On September 1, 2009 and September 2, 2009, and thereafter, the Mediating Parties participated in the Mediation.
     2.18 While a settlement was not reached at the Mediation, the Mediator continued to discuss and negotiate among the Mediating Parties to determine if a global agreement could be reached.
     2.19 Through continued negotiations and the efforts of the Mediator, which continued for more than a month after September 2, 2009, the Mediating Parties were able to reach the settlement outlined in the MOU and set forth in this Stipulation.
 
     2.20 The Parties, by and through their undersigned attorneys and representatives, have engaged in extensive good faith, arm's-length negotiations with regard to the Settlement and the terms and conditions set forth in this Stipulation.
     2.21 The Company has indemnified the Individual Defendants, Young, and Baird, and advanced legal fees and expenses in connection with defending the Action and the SEC Investigation, and such legal fees and expenses have been advanced both by the Company's directors and officers liability insurance primary carrier, Federal Insurance Company, the limits of the policy of which have been fully utilized, and by the Company.

inter alia
 
     2.25 The Parties hereto are entering into this Stipulation because the Settlement will eliminate the substantial expenses, burdens, and risks associated with further litigation of the Action, the CCP Action, the Black Box Claims, and the Young Claims, and because the independent directors on the Board believe the Settlement is in the best interests of Black Box and Current Black Box Stockholders.
     NOW, THEREFORE, INTENDING TO BE LEGALLY BOUND, IT IS HEREBY STIPULATED AND AGREED, subject to approval of the Court, by and among the Parties and the Insurers, as follows:
III. SETTLEMENT OF THE ACTION
     3.1 Following the commencement of the Action and the SEC Investigation and completion of the Audit Committee Review, the Company and certain Defendants took the actions set forth below. The Company acknowledges that the commencement and prosecution of the Action related to and preceded all of, and were a factor leading to certain of, the actions set forth below. The Company acknowledges that several of such actions confer substantial benefits on the Company and Current Black Box Stockholders.
     3.2 Three (3) of the Company's current directors and the Company's current chief financial officer ("CFO") (with respect to one option he received during his tenure as CFO), who held options as to which the measurement date was adjusted in the Company's restatement of its financial statements, voluntarily repriced those outstanding options so that the exercise prices would match the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the appropriate measurement date as determined by the Audit Committee.
     3.3 Baird, in connection with her settlement with the SEC, agreed to pay the difference between the exercise price and the restatement price of certain option grants dated
 
October 11, 2000. The amount of her payment, which will be paid to the Company, is $87,243, plus $31,402 in interest, for a total of $118,645 and shall be made to the Company within ten (10) business days after the Effective Date.
     3.4 As a result of the Board's determination that, at the time Young resigned, there was Cause for Termination, the Company deemed Young's outstanding options, totalling 1,455,402 shares, to have terminated as of the date of his resignation, pursuant to the terms of the underlying grant agreements. Young's Black-Scholes analysis of the value of the terminated options is approximately $19.6 million. Due to the Board's determination, Young claims he was also denied other financial benefits. Plaintiffs believe that the Company received a benefit of over $19.6 million by virtue of the Board's determination that Young could have been terminated for cause as of the date of his resignation. Young asserts that the Company's termination of his outstanding options breached the Young Agreement. The Company denies and disputes the Young Claims.
     3.5 Black Box gave notice to its directors' and officers' liability insurance carrier, XL Specialty Insurance Company ("XL Speciality"), under the side A excess policy and, together with Plaintiffs' Counsel and Young, negotiated a contribution to the Settlement from XL Specialty of $1.5 million, which, within ten (10) business days after receipt of fax, email, or other written notice of the Court's entry of the Preliminary Approval Order approving the Settlement, XL Specialty will pay into escrow to be held in an escrow account established by the Company pending the Effective Date.
     3.6 The Company gave notice and asserted a claim against its employment practices liability insurance carrier, St. Paul Mercury Insurance Co. ("Travelers"), as a result of Young's claims against the Company, and negotiated a contribution of $500,000 to the Settlement from
 
Travelers, which, within ten (10) business days after receipt of fax, email, or other written notice of the Court's entry of the Preliminary Approval Order approving the Settlement, Travelers will pay into escrow to be held in an escrow account established by the Company pending the Effective Date.
     3.7 Following the commencement of the Action and the SEC Investigation and the completion of the Audit Committee Review, the Board made certain changes to the Company's stock option granting practices, record-keeping practices, and governance practices as set forth below. The Company acknowledges that the commencement and prosecution of the Action related to and preceded all of, and were a factor leading to certain of, the actions set forth in this section and that such actions confer substantial benefits on the Company and Current Black Box Stockholders:
     1. Stock Option Granting Practices
     a. All future stock option grants are to be approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee") so long as it is comprised of at least two disinterested directors as currently provided for in the Company's 1992 Stock Option Plan; accordingly, stock option granting authority may not be delegated.
     b. Compensation Committee approval of option grants to the Chief Executive Officer and all other Executive Officers is to take place only after such grants are reviewed by all non-employee directors in the context of its assessment of their overall compensation.
     c. Any management recommendation of proposed stock option grants must be fully developed  with all individual grant recipients and grant amounts being detailed  prior to the Compensation Committee's review and approval of such grants.
     d. The Compensation Committee's actions must specify the individual grant recipients and grant amounts, the vesting schedule, the option term, the grant date, and an exercise price based on the fair market value of the Company's common stock on that grant date, which may not be earlier than the date of the Compensation Committee approval action.
 
     e. The Compensation Committee must approve option grants to non-employee directors only (i) upon the recommendation of the Governance Committee of the Board (the "Governance Committee") at a regularly-scheduled meeting and (ii) after review by the full Board.
     f. All option grants must be considered and awarded at regularly scheduled meetings of the Compensation Committee. In certain circumstances (e.g., grants to new employees in connection with their hiring or grants in connection with acquisitions), the Compensation Committee may approve grants at a duly-convened Compensation Committee meeting or pursuant to a properly-documented unanimous written consent, in each case under terms that define individual grant recipients and grant amounts, the grant date, and an exercise price based on the fair market value of the Company's common stock on that grant date, which shall not be earlier than the date of the Compensation Committee approval action.
     2. Record-Keeping Practices
     a. Outside counsel is to attend and serve as acting secretary for all meetings of the Board and Board committees with specific responsibility for ensuring that minutes of the Board and of the Board committee meetings are prepared on a timely basis and accurately reflect Board and Board committee deliberations and actions.
     b. The Company's Secretary, the Company's inside counsel, and the acting secretary for such meetings shall have direct access to the Company's non-executive Chairman in order to address and resolve any issues relating to maintenance of the Company's records.
     c. Minutes of all Board meetings shall be reviewed and approved by the directors at the next succeeding Board meeting and minutes of all Board committee meetings shall be reviewed and approved by the members of that committee at the next succeeding committee meeting.
     d. Board meeting books shall include the minutes of all Board committee meetings held since the last Board meeting (as approved, if then available, or otherwise in draft) so that all directors might be fully-informed concerning the actions of all Board committees.
     e. The Company's Secretary, outside counsel, and acting secretary shall review all descriptions of Board or Board committee actions contained in the Company's SEC filings to ensure that those disclosures are complete and accurate.
 
     3. Governance
     a. In accord with the MOU, on December 3, 2009, the Board elected an additional "Independent Director" and it is expected that this Independent Director will stand for election by the Company's stockholders at the next annual meeting. The Board, in the exercise of its business judgment, may decide to nominate one additional Independent Director for election to the Board within the three year period beginning January 1, 2010. "Independent Director" is defined to have the same definition applicable to directors of the Company generally (other than members of an audit committee) under the rules of Nasdaq and the SEC in effect at the time of election.
     b. The Company has rotated certain of the members that currently comprise the Compensation, Audit, Nominating, and Governance committees of the Board.
     c. The Chairman of the Board shall be an Independent Director. The Board shall enact an appropriate resolution that the Chairman of the Board shall be an Independent Director.
Plaintiffs' Counsel made written requests, commented upon, and negotiated with respect to the Company's changes in its stock option granting practices, record-keeping practices, and governance practices. Plaintiffs' Counsel has concluded that the foregoing actions by the Company were appropriate responses to the issues raised by the Company's historical stock option practices. Plaintiffs will not seek any additional changes to or other action with respect to the Company's stock option granting practices, record-keeping practices, or governance practices.
     3.8 Plaintiffs expressly represent and warrant that, in entering into the Settlement, they relied upon their own knowledge and investigation (including the knowledge of and investigation performed by Plaintiffs' Counsel), and, except for the documents provided by Black Box referenced in Section 6.2(a) hereof, not upon any promise, representation, warranty, or other statement made by or on behalf of Black Box, Young, Baird, or any of the Individual Defendants not expressly contained in this Stipulation.
Reliance Upon Own Knowledge.
     3.9 The Individual Defendants, Young, Baird, and Nominal Defendant Black Box do not admit and expressly deny all of Plaintiffs' claims in the
Defendants' Denial of Liability.
 
Action; the Company does not admit and expressly denies any and all claims Young may have against the Company, and Young does not admit and expressly denies any and all claims the Company may have against him and that the Company's determination that Young could have been terminated due to Cause for Termination was proper or lawful. The Plaintiffs acknowledge and agree that the execution of this Stipulation by the Individual Defendants, Young, Baird, and the Company is not an admission on their part that they have in any way committed or attempted to commit any violation of law or breach of fiduciary duty, including a breach of any duty to Black Box or its stockholders or otherwise acted in any improper manner; and Young acknowledges and agrees that the execution of this Stipulation by Black Box is not an admission on the part of the Company that it has in any way committed or attempted to commit any violation of law or breach of the Young Agreement in connection with its determination that Young could have been terminated for cause, or committed any wrongful employment practices against Young. Black Box acknowledges and agrees that the execution of this Stipulation by Young, Baird, and the Individual Defendants is not an admission on their part that they have in any way committed any violation of law or breach of fiduciary duty or violated any contract with Black Box or otherwise acted in any improper manner. Black Box, Young, Baird, and each of the Individual Defendants have denied and continue to deny all of the claims in the Action, the CCP Action, the Black Box Claims, and the Young Claims, as applicable, and have denied and continue to deny having committed, aided, or attempted to commit any violations of law or breach of any duty of any kind or otherwise acted in any improper manner. Black Box, Young, Baird, and each of the Individual Defendants are entering into this Stipulation because the Settlement would eliminate the expenses, burdens, and risks associated with further litigation of the Action and the CCP Action. Black Box is entering into
 
this Stipulation for the further reason that it believes that the Settlement is in the best interests of Black Box and Current Black Box Stockholders.
     3.10 The Parties to the Action will present the Settlement to the Court for hearing and approval by the Joint Motion as soon as practicable and for the dismissal of the Action with prejudice as to all claims asserted or which could have been asserted against the Defendants, including Nominal Defendant Black Box, in the Action.

The Company shall pay such fees and expenses within 60 days of presentation unless Young is not entitled to the requested indemnification or payment under the Company's articles of incorporation or by-laws or applicable law.
 
     6.17 The Young Released Parties will not release and the Company will pay any claims for indemnification and advancement of reasonable and necessary legal fees and expenses incurred by Young to conclude the Action and the SEC Investigation.

The Company will not indemnify or advance on behalf of Young any legal fees and expenses that are clearly and solely related to the Young Claims against the Company, such as consulting with a tax expert. If Young requests advancement and indemnification for any fees and expenses which are denied by the Company, before taking any action with respect to such request, counsel for Young and counsel for the Company will negotiate in good faith to attempt to resolve their disagreement.
     6.19 Nothing contained herein is intended to limit Young's right to future indemnification or advancement of legal fees and expenses reasonably incurred in accord with the Company's articles of incorporation or by-laws or applicable law. The Company will not indemnify Young for the payment of any fine or penalty to the SEC.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, May 13, 2010 - Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported results for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010 ended March 31, 2010.
For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010, diluted earnings per share were 43 on net income of $7.5 million or 3.1% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of 48 on net income of $8.4 million or 3.5% of revenues for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, third quarter of Fiscal 2010 diluted earnings per share were 63 on net income of $11.0 million or 4.3% of revenues. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010 were 78 on operating net income (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) of $13.8 million or 5.7% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of 92 on operating net income of $16.2 million or 6.7% of revenues for the same quarter last year. See below for additional information regarding the comparability of Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009 operating earnings per share. Management believes that presenting operating earnings per share and operating net income is useful to investors because it provides a more meaningful comparison of the ongoing operations of the Company.
For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $9.6 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $6.3 million and 35, respectively. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $11.6 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $7.8 million and 44, respectively. See below for further discussion regarding Management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements and a detailed presentation of the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the periods presented above. Included in our fourth quarter and Fiscal 2010 results is the impact of a decrease in our annual effective tax rate from our previous estimate of 37.5% to the actual effective tax rate of 36.5%, resulting in an effective tax rate of 33.5% for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010. This tax rate reduction is primarily the result of the reduction in valuation allowances against certain net operating losses. The effective tax rate reduction increased fourth quarter and Fiscal 2010 operating earnings per share by 4.
Fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010 total revenues were $241 million equivalent to $241 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, third quarter of Fiscal 2010 total revenues were $253 million.
Fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010 cash provided by operating activities was $20 million or 264% of net income, compared to $20 million or 237% of net income for the same quarter last year. Fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010 free cash flow (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) was $18 million compared to $19 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, third quarter of Fiscal 2010 cash provided by operating activities was $12 million or 105% of net income and free cash flow was $11 million. Black Box utilized its fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010 free cash flow primarily to fund debt reduction of $17 million and to pay dividends of $1 million. Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company.
Fiscal 2010 diluted earnings per share were $1.97 on net income of $34.5 million or 3.6% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of $2.59 on net income of $45.3 million or 4.5% of revenues for the same period last year. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share for Fiscal 2010 were $2.99 on operating net income of $52.4 million or 5.5% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of $3.39 on operating net income of $59.5 million or 5.9% of revenues for the same period last year.

During Fiscal 2010, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $28.2 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $17.9 million and $1.02, respectively. During Fiscal 2009, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $21.6 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $14.1 million and 80, respectively.
Fiscal 2010 total revenues were $961 million, a decrease of $39 million or 4% from $1.0 billion for the same period last year.
Fiscal 2010 cash provided by operating activities was $62 million or 180% of net income compared to $72 million or 158% of net income for the same period last year. Free cash flow was $59 million compared to $68 million for the same period last year. Black Box utilized its Fiscal 2010 free cash flow primarily to fund debt reduction of $36 million, fund acquisition activity of $19 million and to pay dividends of $4 million.
The Company's six-month order backlog was $203 million at March 31, 2010 compared to $194 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter-end comparison basis, the Company's six-month order backlog was $191 million at December 26, 2009.
For Fiscal 2011, the Company is targeting reported revenues of approximately $990 million to $1.01 billion and corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of $2.90 to $3.10. Included in these projections is approximately 2% to 4% of organic revenue growth and an effective tax rate of 38.0%. For the first quarter of Fiscal 2011, the Company is targeting reported revenues of approximately $240 million to $245 million and corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of 70 to 75.
All of the above exclude acquisition-related expense and the impact of changes in the fair market value of the Company's interest-rate swaps, and all of the above are before any new mergers and acquisition activity that has not been announced.
Commenting on Fiscal 2010 results and the first quarter of Fiscal 2011 outlook, Terry Blakemore, President and Chief Executive Officer said, "I am very pleased with our performance for the fourth quarter and Fiscal 2010.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
As a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures such as free cash flow, cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments (see below for reference), operating net income, operating earnings per share ("EPS"), Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income and same-office revenue comparisons to illustrate the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided Management explanations regarding their use and the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which are provided below.
The Company's Management ("Management") uses non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and (e) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members. Moreover, the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, they do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years which is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets, (iv) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash change in fair value of the Company's interest-rate swaps which will continue to impact the Company's earnings until the interest-rate swaps are settled, (v) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude costs for employee severance and facility consolidations ("employee severance and facility consolidations costs") incurred during the periods reported in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services that will impact future operating results, (vi) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs, including costs associated with the related Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") investigation, shareholder derivative lawsuit, tax matters and insurance/indemnification matters, (vii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude costs of settlement or resolution arising from current legal matters associated with the ongoing operations of the Company ("current legal matters costs") and (viii) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow
Free cash flow is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, plus proceeds from stock option exercises. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
Net capital expenditures
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be taken into account along with cash provided by operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures are typically material and directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.
Foreign currency exchange impact on cash
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to U.S. dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive and/or negative impact of such adjustments as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in U.S. dollars.
 
Page 8
Proceeds from stock option exercises
The Company believes that proceeds from stock option exercises should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the actual cash available to the Company. The Company has demonstrated a recurring inflow of cash related to its stock-based compensation plans and, since this cash is immediately available to the Company, it directly impacts the availability of the Company's operating cash. The amount of proceeds from stock option exercises is dependent upon a number of variables, including the number and exercise price of outstanding options and the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the timing of stock option exercises is under the control of the individual option holder and is not in the control of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of any proceeds from stock option exercises.
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities plus restructuring payments. Restructuring payments are the cash payments made during the period for employee severance and facility consolidation costs. The Company believes that restructuring payments should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the cash flow from operations.
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is presented below:
Operating net income and operating earnings per share
Management believes that operating net income, defined by the Company as net income plus reconciling items, and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provide investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in a way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Reconciling items include amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions, the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps, employee severance and facility consolidation costs, historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs and current legal matters costs. Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below.
Amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
 
Page 9
Asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions
The Company incurs non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years. Specifically, this non-cash expenditure is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets. Asset write-ups are depreciated over their remaining useful life which generally falls between one to five years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed from acquisition to the end of the asset's useful life and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps
To mitigate the risk of interest-rate fluctuations associated with the Company's variable rate debt, the Company entered into two separate interest-rate swaps ("interest-rate swaps") that do not qualify as a cash flow hedge. Thus, the Company records the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps as an asset/liability within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with the offset to Interest expense (income) within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Management excludes this non-cash expense and the related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Employee severance and facility consolidation costs
The Company believes that incurring costs in the current period(s) in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services will result in a long-term positive impact on financial performance in the future. Employee severance and facility consolidation costs are presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. However, due to the amount of additional costs incurred during a single or possibly successive periods, Management believes that exclusion of these costs and their related tax impact provides a more accurate reflection of the Company's ongoing financial performance.
Historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs
The Company incurs costs in connection with its investigation of historical stock option granting practices, including the related SEC investigation, shareholder derivative lawsuit, tax matters and insurance/indemnification matters. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Current legal matters costs
The Company incurs costs arising from current legal matters associated with the ongoing operations of the Company. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009 comparability
During Fiscal 2009, the Company excluded stock-based compensation expense when evaluating the continuing operations of the Company. Beginning with the first quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company will not exclude such expenses. For comparability purposes only, the Company has restated reconciling items, operating net income and operating EPS for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009 and Fiscal 2009 to reflect this change in presentation.
Information on stock-based compensation expense and its after-tax impact on net income and EPS is presented below:

The effective tax rate utilized to determine Reconciling items, after tax, for each period, is the effective tax rate utilized to determine Net income for such period.

A reconciliation of diluted EPS to operating EPS is presented below:
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
Management believes that EBITDA, defined as income before provision for income taxes plus interest, depreciation and amortization, is a widely accepted measure of profitability that may be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Adjusted EBITDA, defined as EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense, may also be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Stock-based compensation is an integral part of ongoing operations since it is considered similar to other types of compensation to employees. However, Management believes that varying levels of stock-based compensation expense could result in misleading period-over-period comparisons and is providing an adjusted disclosure which excludes stock-based compensation.
A reconciliation of income before provision for income taxes to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is presented below:

Geographical Segment Results
Management is presented with and reviews revenues, operating income and adjusted operating income by geographical segment. Adjusted operating income is defined by the Company as operating income plus reconciling items. Reconciling items include amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions, employee severance and facility consolidation costs, historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs and current legal matters costs. See above for additional details provided by Management regarding non-GAAP financial measures. Revenues, operating income and adjusted operating income for North America, Europe and All Other are presented below:
During Fiscal 2009, the Company excluded stock-based compensation expense when evaluating the continuing operations of the Company.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
Item 5.02   Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
            (e) Unless otherwise noted below, each of the actions set forth in this Current Report on Form 8-K (this "Form 8-K") occurred on May 11, 2010.
            The Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Black Box Corporation (the "Company") recommended that the Board approve, and the Board approved, increases in the annual base salaries of certain executive officers of the Company. The annual base salary of R. Terry Blakemore, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and President, was increased to $600,000. In recognition of increased responsibilities, Michael McAndrew was promoted to Executive Vice President, continues as Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary and received an annual base salary increase to $350,000.
            The Committee recommended that the Board approve, and the Board approved, an annual incentive bonus plan (the "FY11 Annual Incentive Plan") under the Black Box Corporation 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2008 Plan") for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2011 ("Fiscal 2011"). The performance goals for the FY11 Annual Incentive Plan are, as defined below, "operating earnings per share," "adjusted operating margin percent," "adjusted EBITDA" and "DSOs." "Operating earnings per share" means "operating net income" divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted) with "operating net income" meaning net income plus "Reconciling Items" (as defined below); "adjusted operating margin percent" means operating income plus Reconciling Items divided by total revenues; "adjusted EBITDA" means EBITDA (net income before provision for income taxes plus interest, depreciation and amortization) plus Reconciling Items; and "DSOs" is an internal management calculation based on the balances in net accounts receivable, cost in excess of billings and billings in excess of costs at the end of the measurement period. "Reconciling Items" means: (i) amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) asset write-up expense on acquisitions; (iv) expenses, settlements, judgments and fines associated with material litigation ($500,000 or greater per matter); (v) changes in fair value of any interest-rate swaps; (vi) certain pension plan funding expenses; (vii) the impact of any goodwill impairment; and (viii) the effect of changes in tax laws or accounting principles affecting reported results.
            The performance goals for the FY11 Annual Incentive Plan will be equally weighted. Under the FY11 Annual Incentive Plan, the achievement of the performance goals at 80% of target (90% of target for the DSOs performance goal) will result in a payout of 50% of targeted annual bonus, the achievement of the performance goals at 100% of target will result in a payout of 100% of targeted annual bonus and the achievement of the performance goals at 120% of target (110% of target for the DSOs performance goal) will result in a payout of 150% of targeted annual bonus.
            Following Board review and approval, the Committee made targeted annual bonus awards under the FY11 Annual Incentive Plan to the Company's executive officers as follows: R. Terry Blakemore -- 100% of base salary or $600,000; Michael McAndrew -- 100% of base salary or $350,000; and Francis W. Wertheimber, Senior Vice President -- approximately 50% of base salary or $133,000. Key, non-executive employees are also participating in the FY11 Annual Incentive Plan generally on the same terms as the executive officers.
 
            The Committee recommended that the Board approve, and the Board approved, a new Long-Term Incentive Program (the "FY11 LTIP") under the 2008 Plan for the three fiscal years ending March 31, 2013 (the "Performance Period"). The FY11 LTIP is comprised of a restricted stock unit grant payable in shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value $.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), representing 20% of the award, a stock option grant representing 30% of the award and a performance share award (the "Performance Award") payable in shares of the Common Stock representing 50% of the award.
            The restricted stock units and stock options granted pursuant to the FY11 LTIP will vest in equal increments over three years. The payout on the Performance Awards will be based on the Company's performance of (i) a cumulative adjusted EBITDA goal (the "EBITDA Goal") and (ii) the Company's total shareholder return ("TSR") relative to a peer group of companies for the Performance Period. These two (2) performance goals will be equally weighted. As a result, for purposes of determining the payout of the Performance Awards: (A) the achievement of 75% of the EBITDA Goal will result in a payout of 25% of the targeted Performance Award, the achievement of 100% of the EBITDA Goal will result in a payout of 50% of the targeted Performance Award and the achievement of 120% of the EBITDA Goal will result in a payout of 75% of the targeted Performance Award; and (B) the ranking of the Company's TSR in the 25 percentile of the peer group's TSR will result in a payout of 25% of the targeted Performance Award, the ranking of the Company's TSR at the median level of performance of the Company's TSR as compared to the Company's peer group's TSR will result in a payout of 50% of the targeted Performance Award and the ranking of the Company's TSR in the 75 percentile of the peer group's TSR will result in a payout of 75% of the targeted Performance Award.
th
th
            Following Board review and approval, the Committee approved the following awards under the FY11 LTIP to the Company's executive officers: Mr. Blakemore -- a restricted stock unit award of 16,000 shares of the Common Stock, a stock option grant for 80,000 shares of the Common Stock and a Performance Award of 27,000 shares of the Common Stock; Mr. McAndrew -- a restricted stock unit award of 8,000 shares of the Common Stock, a stock option grant for 40,000 shares of the Common Stock and a Performance Award of 13,500 shares of the Common Stock; and Mr. Wertheimber -- a restricted stock unit award of 2,500 shares of the Common Stock, a stock option grant for 12,000 shares of the Common Stock and a Performance Award of 4,000 shares of the Common Stock. Key, non-executive employees are also participating in the FY11 LTIP generally on the same relative basis as the executive officers.
            The foregoing awards under the 2008 Plan were granted on May 11, 2010 except that the stock options will be granted and will have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock on May 17, 2010.
            The Committee recommended that the Board approve, and the Board approved, the following cash bonuses for the Executive Officers: Mr. Blakemore -- $600,000; Mr. McAndrew -- $150,000 and Mr. Wertheimber -- $75,000.
 
Item 5.03   Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
            On May 11, 2010, the Board amended Article I, Section 10, of the Amended and Restated By-laws, as amended (the "By-laws"), of the Company to require, from any stockholder proposing nominees for director or making any other proposal, additional information regarding such stockholder's agreements, arrangements and understandings with respect to the Company's securities, regardless as to whether such proposal is or is not requested to be included in the Company's proxy statement. The By-laws, as so amended, are filed as Exhibit 3(ii) to this Form 8-K.
Item 8.01   Other Events.
            Except for the annual retainer for the Chair of the Committee, there were no changes in the compensation arrangements for the non-employee members of the Board. The following are such arrangements, effective for Fiscal 2011.
             In addition, on May 11, 2010, each non-employee director received a restricted stock unit award of 3,000 shares of the Common Stock which vested immediately upon grant.
Item 9.01   Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(d) Exhibits.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

As Amended Through May 11, 2010

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, August 3, 2010 - Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported results for the first quarter of Fiscal 2011 ended July 3, 2010.
For the first quarter of Fiscal 2011, diluted earnings per share were 75 on net income of $13.1 million or 5.0% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of 44 on net income of $7.8 million or 3.3% of revenues for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010 diluted earnings per share were 43 on net income of $7.5 million or 3.1% of revenues. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) for the first quarter of Fiscal 2011 were 84 on operating net income (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) of $14.7 million or 5.6% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of 71 on operating net income of $12.4 million or 5.3% of revenues for the same quarter last year.
For the first quarter of Fiscal 2011, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $2.6 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $1.6 million and 9, respectively. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $7.4 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $4.6 million and 27, respectively. See below for further discussion regarding Management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements and a detailed presentation of the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the periods presented above.
First quarter of Fiscal 2011 total revenues were $264 million, an increase of $29 million or 12% from $235 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010 total revenues were $241 million.
First quarter of Fiscal 2011 cash provided by operating activities was $1 million or 9% of net income, compared to $16 million or 206% of net income for the same quarter last year. First quarter of Fiscal 2011 free cash flow (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) was $0.2 million compared to $16 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010 cash provided by operating activities was $20 million or 264% of net income and free cash flow was $18 million. Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company.
The Company's six-month order backlog was $229 million at July 3, 2010 compared to $210 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter-end comparison basis, the Company's six-month order backlog was $203 million at March 31, 2010.

For Fiscal 2011, the Company is targeting reported revenues of approximately $1.025 billion to $1.04 billion and corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of $3.10 to $3.25. Included in these projections is an effective tax rate of 38.0%. For the second quarter of Fiscal 2011, the Company is targeting reported revenues of approximately $255 million to $260 million and corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of 76 to 81.
All of the above exclude acquisition-related expense and the impact of changes in the fair market value of the Company's interest-rate swaps, and all of the above are before any new mergers and acquisition activity that has not been announced.

We continue to invest our resources strategically with the goal of continued organic growth and through strategic acquisitions."

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
As a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures such as free cash flow, cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments (see below for reference), operating net income, operating earnings per share ("EPS"), Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income and same-office revenue comparisons to illustrate the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided Management explanations regarding their use and the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which are provided below.
The Company's management ("Management") uses non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and (e) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members. Moreover, the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, they do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years which is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets, (iv) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash change in fair value of the Company's interest-rate swaps which will continue to impact the Company's earnings until the interest-rate swaps are settled, (v) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude costs for employee severance and facility consolidations ("employee severance and facility consolidation costs") incurred during the periods reported in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services that will impact future operating results, (vi) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs, including costs associated with the related Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") investigation, shareholder derivative lawsuit, tax matters and insurance/indemnification matters, (vii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude costs of settlement or resolution arising from current legal matters associated with the ongoing operations of the Company ("current legal matters costs") and (viii) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow
Free cash flow is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, plus proceeds from stock option exercises. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
Net capital expenditures
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be taken into account along with cash provided by operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures are typically material and directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.
Foreign currency exchange impact on cash
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to U.S. dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive and/or negative impact of such adjustments as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in U.S. dollars.
 
Page 7
The Company believes that proceeds from stock option exercises should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the actual cash available to the Company. The Company has demonstrated a recurring inflow of cash related to its stock-based compensation plans and, since this cash is immediately available to the Company, it directly impacts the availability of the Company's operating cash. The amount of proceeds from stock option exercises is dependent upon a number of variables, including the number and exercise price of outstanding options and the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the timing of stock option exercises is under the control of the individual option holder and is not in the control of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of any proceeds from stock option exercises.
Proceeds from stock option exercises
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
Management believes that operating net income, defined by the Company as net income plus reconciling items, and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provide investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in a way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Reconciling items include amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions, the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps, employee severance and facility consolidation costs, historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs and current legal matters costs. Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below.
Operating net income and operating earnings per share
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions
 
Page 8
The Company incurs non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years. Specifically, this non-cash expenditure is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets. Asset write-ups are depreciated over their remaining useful life which generally falls between one to five years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed from acquisition to the end of the asset's useful life and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions
To mitigate the risk of interest-rate fluctuations associated with the Company's variable rate debt, the Company entered into two separate interest-rate swaps ("interest-rate swaps") that do not qualify as a cash flow hedge. Thus, the Company records the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps as an asset/liability within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with the offset to Interest expense (income) within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Management excludes this non-cash expense and the related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps
The Company believes that incurring costs in the current period(s) in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services will result in a long-term positive impact on financial performance in the future. Employee severance and facility consolidation costs are presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. However, due to the amount of additional costs incurred during a single or possibly successive periods, Management believes that exclusion of these costs and their related tax impact provides a more accurate reflection of the Company's ongoing financial performance.
Employee severance and facility consolidation costs
The Company incurs costs in connection with its investigation of historical stock option granting practices, including the related SEC investigation, shareholder derivative lawsuit, tax matters and insurance/indemnification matters. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs
The Company incurs costs arising from current legal matters associated with the ongoing operations of the Company. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Current legal matters costs

For the second quarter of Fiscal 2011, diluted earnings per share were 77 on net income of $13.6 million or 5.0% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of 47 on net income of $8.2 million or 3.5% of revenues for the same quarter last year.

All of the above exclude acquisition-related expense and the impact of changes in the fair market value of the Company's interest-rate swaps, and all of the above are before any new mergers and acquisition activity that has not been announced.
Commenting on the second quarter of Fiscal 2011 results and the third quarter of Fiscal 2011 outlook, Terry Blakemore, President and Chief Executive Officer said, "I am very proud to report the record revenues delivered by the Black Box team in the quarter.

"Black Box clients continue to recognize that our unique business model provides them with access to a broad portfolio of leading communication solutions coupled with world-class technical expertise. The strength of our financial model continues to provide us with the resources to explore and invest in profitable organic growth and strategic acquisition opportunities. We remain committed to delivering strong financial performance to grow profitably and ultimately increase value to our shareholders."

As a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures such as free cash flow, cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments (see below for reference), operating net income, operating earnings per share ("EPS"), Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income and same-office revenue comparisons to illustrate the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided Management explanations regarding their use and the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which are provided below.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company's management ("Management") uses non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and (e) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members. Moreover, the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, they do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years which is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets, (iv) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash change in fair value of the Company's interest-rate swaps which will continue to impact the Company's earnings until the interest-rate swaps are settled, (v) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude costs for employee severance and facility consolidations ("employee severance and facility consolidation costs") incurred during the periods reported in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services that will impact future operating results, (vi) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs, including costs associated with the related Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") investigation, shareholder derivative lawsuit, tax matters and insurance/indemnification matters, (vii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude costs of settlement or resolution arising from current legal matters associated with the ongoing operations of the Company ("current legal matters costs") and (viii) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, plus proceeds from stock option exercises. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
Free cash flow
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be taken into account along with cash provided by operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures are typically material and directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.
Net capital expenditures
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to U.S. dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive and/or negative impact of such adjustments as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in U.S. dollars.
Foreign currency exchange impact on cash
 
Page 8
The Company believes that proceeds from stock option exercises should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the actual cash available to the Company. The Company has demonstrated a recurring inflow of cash related to its stock-based compensation plans and, since this cash is immediately available to the Company, it directly impacts the availability of the Company's operating cash. The amount of proceeds from stock option exercises is dependent upon a number of variables, including the number and exercise price of outstanding options and the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the timing of stock option exercises is under the control of the individual option holder and is not in the control of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of any proceeds from stock option exercises.
Proceeds from stock option exercises
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities plus restructuring payments. Restructuring payments are the cash payments made during the period for employee severance and facility consolidation costs. The Company believes that restructuring payments should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the cash flow from operations.
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is presented below:
Management believes that operating net income, defined by the Company as net income plus reconciling items, and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provide investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in a way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Reconciling items include amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions, the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps, employee severance and facility consolidation costs, historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs and current legal matters costs. Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below.
Operating net income and operating earnings per share
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions
 
Page 9
The Company incurs non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years. Specifically, this non-cash expenditure is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets. Asset write-ups are depreciated over their remaining useful life which generally falls between one to five years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed from acquisition to the end of the asset's useful life and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions
To mitigate the risk of interest-rate fluctuations associated with the Company's variable rate debt, the Company entered into two separate interest-rate swaps ("interest-rate swaps") that do not qualify as a cash flow hedge. Thus, the Company records the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps as an asset/liability within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with the offset to Interest expense (income) within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Management excludes this non-cash expense and the related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps
The Company believes that incurring costs in the current period(s) in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services will result in a long-term positive impact on financial performance in the future. Employee severance and facility consolidation costs are presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. However, due to the amount of additional costs incurred during a single or possibly successive periods, Management believes that exclusion of these costs and their related tax impact provides a more accurate reflection of the Company's ongoing financial performance.
Employee severance and facility consolidation costs
The Company incurs costs in connection with its investigation of historical stock option granting practices, including the related SEC investigation, shareholder derivative lawsuit, tax matters and insurance/indemnification matters. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs
The Company incurs costs arising from current legal matters associated with the ongoing operations of the Company. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Current legal matters costs

The effective tax rate utilized to determine Reconciling items, after tax, for each period, is the effective tax rate utilized to determine Net income for such period.

A reconciliation of diluted EPS to operating EPS is presented below:
Management believes that EBITDA, defined as Net income plus provision for income taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization, is a widely accepted measure of profitability that may be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Adjusted EBITDA, defined as EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense, may also be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Stock-based compensation is an integral part of ongoing operations since it is considered similar to other types of compensation to employees. However, Management believes that varying levels of stock-based compensation expense could result in misleading period-over-period comparisons and is providing an adjusted disclosure which excludes stock-based compensation.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
A reconciliation of income before provision for income taxes to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is presented below:

Supplemental Information
Management is presented with and reviews revenues, operating income and adjusted operating income by geographical segment. Adjusted operating income is defined by the Company as operating income plus reconciling items. Reconciling items include amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions, employee severance and facility consolidation costs, historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs and current legal matters costs. See above for additional details provided by Management regarding non-GAAP financial measures.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, February 1, 2011 - Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported results for the third quarter of Fiscal 2011 ended January 1, 2011.
Third quarter of Fiscal 2011 diluted earnings per share were 78 on net income of $13.9 million or 5.0% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of 63 on net income of $11.0 million or 4.3% of revenues for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, second quarter of Fiscal 2011 diluted earnings per share were 77 on net income of $13.6 million or 5.0% of revenues. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) for the third quarter of Fiscal 2011 were 84 on operating net income (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) of $15.0 million or 5.4% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of 77 on operating net income of $13.6 million or 5.4% of revenues for the same quarter last year.
Third quarter of Fiscal 2011 pre-tax reconciling items were $1.8 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $1.1 million and 6, respectively. During the third quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $4.1 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $2.6 million and 14, respectively. See below for further discussion regarding Management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements and a detailed presentation of the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the periods presented above.
Third quarter of Fiscal 2011 total revenues were $277 million, an increase of $24 million or 9% from $253 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, second quarter of Fiscal 2011 total revenues were $273 million.
Third quarter of Fiscal 2011 cash provided by operating activities was $28 million or 201% of net income, compared to $12 million or 105% of net income for the same quarter last year.

Black Box utilized its third quarter of Fiscal 2011 free cash flow primarily to fund acquisition activity of $13 million, fund debt reduction of $9 million and to pay dividends of $1 million. Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company.
 
For the nine-month period ended January 1, 2011, diluted earnings per share were $2.30 on net income of $40.6 million or 5.0% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.54 on net income of $27.0 million or 3.7% of revenues for the same period last year. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share for the nine-month period ended January 1, 2011 were $2.55 on operating net income of $45.0 million or 5.5% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of $2.20 on operating net income of $38.6 million or 5.4% of revenues for the same period last year.
For the nine-month period ended January 1, 2011, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $7.1 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $4.4 million and 25, respectively. For the nine-month period ended December 26, 2009, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $18.6 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $11.6 million and 66, respectively.
For the nine-month period ended January 1, 2011, total revenues were $813 million, an increase of $92 million or 13% from $721 million for the same period last year.
Cash provided by operating activities for the nine-month period ended January 1, 2011 was $36 million or 89% of net income compared to $42 million or 156% of net income for the same period last year. Free cash flow was $39 million compared to $41 million for the same period last year. Black Box utilized its nine-month period free cash flow primarily to fund acquisition activity of $15 million, fund debt reduction of $13 million and to pay dividends of $3 million.
The Company's six-month order backlog was $212 million at January 1, 2011 compared to $191 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter-end comparison basis, the Company's six-month order backlog was $213 million at October 2, 2010.
For Fiscal 2011, the Company is targeting reported revenues of approximately $1.073 billion to $1.078 billion and corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of $3.34 to $3.39. Included in these projections is an effective tax rate of 38.0%. For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011, the Company is targeting reported revenues of approximately $260 million to $265 million and corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of 79 to 84. These targets exclude acquisition-related expense and the impact of changes in the fair market value of the Company's interest-rate swaps, and are before any new mergers and acquisition activity that has not been announced.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
As a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures such as free cash flow, cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments (see below for reference), operating net income, operating earnings per share ("EPS"), Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income and same-office revenue comparisons to illustrate the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided explanations of the Company's management ("Management") regarding their use and the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which are provided below.
Management uses non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and (e) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members. Moreover, the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, they do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years which is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets, (iv) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash change in fair value of the Company's interest-rate swaps which will continue to impact the Company's earnings until the interest-rate swaps are settled, (v) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude costs for employee severance and facility consolidations ("employee severance and facility consolidation costs") incurred during the periods reported in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services that will impact future operating results, (vi) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs, including costs associated with the related Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") investigation, shareholder derivative lawsuit, tax matters and insurance/indemnification matters, (vii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude costs of settlement or resolution arising from current legal matters associated with the ongoing operations of the Company ("current legal matters costs") and (viii) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow
Free cash flow is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, plus proceeds from stock option exercises. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
Net capital expenditures
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be taken into account along with cash provided by operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures are typically material and directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.
6
 
Foreign currency exchange impact on cash
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to U.S. dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive and/or negative impact of such adjustments as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in U.S. dollars.
Proceeds from stock option exercises
The Company believes that proceeds from stock option exercises should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the actual cash available to the Company. The Company has demonstrated a recurring inflow of cash related to its stock-based compensation plans and, since this cash is immediately available to the Company, it directly impacts the availability of the Company's operating cash. The amount of proceeds from stock option exercises is dependent upon a number of variables, including the number and exercise price of outstanding options and the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the timing of stock option exercises is under the control of the individual option holder and is not in the control of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of any proceeds from stock option exercises.
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities plus restructuring payments. Restructuring payments are the cash payments made during the period for employee severance and facility consolidation costs. The Company believes that restructuring payments should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the cash flow from operations.
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is presented below:
Operating net income and operating earnings per share
Management believes that operating net income, defined by the Company as net income plus reconciling items, and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provide investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in a way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Reconciling items include amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions, the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps, employee severance and facility consolidation costs, historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs and current legal matters costs. Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below.
Amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
7
 
Asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions
The Company incurs non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years. Specifically, this non-cash expenditure is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets. Asset write-ups are depreciated over their remaining useful life which generally falls between one to five years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed from acquisition to the end of the asset's useful life and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps
To mitigate the risk of interest-rate fluctuations associated with the Company's variable rate debt, the Company entered into two separate interest-rate swaps ("interest-rate swaps") that do not qualify as a cash flow hedge. Thus, the Company records the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps as an asset/liability within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with the offset to Interest expense (income) within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Management excludes this non-cash expense and the related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Employee severance and facility consolidation costs
The Company believes that incurring costs in the current period(s) in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services will result in a long-term positive impact on financial performance in the future. Employee severance and facility consolidation costs are presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. However, due to the amount of additional costs incurred during a single or possibly successive periods, Management believes that exclusion of these costs and their related tax impact provides a more accurate reflection of the Company's ongoing financial performance.
Historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs
The Company incurs costs in connection with its investigation of historical stock option granting practices, including the related SEC investigation, shareholder derivative lawsuit, tax matters and insurance/indemnification matters. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Current legal matters costs
The Company incurs costs arising from current legal matters associated with the ongoing operations of the Company. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
The following table represents the Company's pre-tax reconciling items:

A reconciliation of net income to operating net income is presented below:
A reconciliation of diluted EPS to operating EPS is presented below:
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
Management believes that EBITDA, defined as Net income plus provision for income taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization, is a widely accepted measure of profitability that may be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Adjusted EBITDA, defined as EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense, may also be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Stock-based compensation is an integral part of ongoing operations since it is considered similar to other types of compensation to employees. However, Management believes that varying levels of stock-based compensation expense could result in misleading period-over-period comparisons and is providing an adjusted disclosure which excludes stock-based compensation.
A reconciliation of income before provision for income taxes to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is presented below:

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, May 12, 2011  Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported results for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011.
Fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 diluted earnings per share were 68 on net income of $12.3 million or 4.8% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of 43 on net income of $7.5 million or 3.1% of revenues for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, third quarter of Fiscal 2011 diluted earnings per share were 78 on net income of $13.9 million or 5.0% of revenues. Excluding reconciling items (which are identified below), operating earnings per share (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 were 75 on operating net income (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) of $13.5 million or 5.3% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of 78 on operating net income of $13.8 million or 5.7% of revenues for the same quarter last year.
Fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 pre-tax reconciling items were $2.0 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $1.3 million and 7, respectively. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $9.6 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $6.3 million and 35, respectively. See below for further discussion regarding Management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements and a detailed presentation of the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the periods presented above.
Fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 total revenues were $255 million, an increase of 6% from $241 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, third quarter of Fiscal 2011 total revenues were $277 million.
Fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 cash provided by operating activities was $19 million or 153% of net income, compared to $20 million or 264% of net income for the same quarter last year. Fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 free cash flow (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) was $22 million compared to $18 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, third quarter of Fiscal 2011 cash provided by operating activities was $28 million or 201% of net income and free cash flow was $31 million. Black Box utilized its fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 free cash flow primarily to fund debt reduction of $17 million and to pay dividends of $1 million. Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company.
Fiscal 2011 diluted earnings per share were $2.97 on net income of $52.9 million or 4.9% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.97 on net income of $34.5 million or 3.6% of revenues for the same period last year. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share for Fiscal 2011 were $3.29 on operating net income of $58.5 million or 5.5% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of $2.99 on operating net income of $52.4 million or 5.5% of revenues for the same period last year.

Fiscal 2011 pre-tax reconciling items were $9.1 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $5.7 million and 32, respectively. Fiscal 2010 pre-tax reconciling items were $28.2 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $17.9 million and $1.02, respectively.
Fiscal 2011 total revenues were $1,068 million, an increase of 11% from $961 million for the same period last year.
Fiscal 2011 cash provided by operating activities was $55 million or 104% of net income compared to $62 million or 180% of net income for the same period last year. Free cash flow was $61 million compared to $59 million for the same period last year. Black Box utilized its Fiscal 2011 free cash flow primarily to fund debt reduction of $30 million, to fund acquisition activity of $15 million and to pay dividends of $4 million.
The Company's six-month order backlog was $223 million at March 31, 2011 compared to $203 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter-end comparison basis, the Company's six-month order backlog was $212 million at January 1, 2011.
For Fiscal 2012, the Company is targeting reported revenues of approximately $1.125 billion to $1.145 billion and corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of $3.50 to $3.70. Included in these projections is an effective tax rate of 38.0%. For the first quarter of Fiscal 2012, the Company is targeting reported revenues of approximately $260 million to $265 million and corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of 80 to 85. These targets exclude acquisition-related expense and the impact of changes in the fair market value of the Company's interest-rate swaps, and are before any new mergers and acquisition activity that has not been announced.
Commenting on the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 results and the first quarter of Fiscal 2012 outlook, Terry Blakemore, President and Chief Executive Officer said, "I am proud to announce our record revenue for Fiscal 2011. Our results for the year demonstrate the power of our diversified solution offering and client base. As different sectors of the global economy improved, Black Box was able to capture the benefit of that improvement and grow revenues organically by nine percent. Through disciplined management, our teams provided world-class solutions to our global clients and expanded our adjusted operating income margins for the year."
"In Fiscal 2012, we look forward to strengthening our position as a communication system integrator by investing in our business and making select, strategic acquisitions. We remain committed to grow profitably and deliver value to our clients and shareholders."

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
As a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures such as free cash flow, cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments (see below for reference), operating net income, operating earnings per share ("EPS"), Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income and same-office revenue comparisons to illustrate the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided explanations of the Company's management ("Management") regarding their use and the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which are provided below.
Management uses non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and (e) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members. Moreover, the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, they do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions related to acquisitions made during recent years which is derived from the book value to fair market value write-up on acquired assets, (iv) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash change in fair value of the Company's interest-rate swaps which will continue to impact the Company's earnings until the interest-rate swaps are settled, (v) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude costs for employee severance and facility consolidations ("employee severance and facility consolidation costs") incurred during the periods reported in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services that will impact future operating results, (vi) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs, including costs associated with the related Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") investigation, shareholder derivative lawsuit, tax matters and insurance/indemnification matters, (vii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude costs of settlement or resolution arising from current legal matters associated with the ongoing operations of the Company ("current legal matters costs") and (viii) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow
Free cash flow is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, plus proceeds from stock option exercises. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be taken into account along with cash provided by operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures are typically material and directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.
Net capital expenditures
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to U.S. dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive and/or negative impact of such adjustments as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in U.S. dollars.

Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments
Cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities plus restructuring payments. Restructuring payments are the cash payments made during the period for employee severance and facility consolidation costs. The Company believes that restructuring payments should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the cash flow from operations.
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to cash provided by operating activities excluding restructuring payments is presented below:
Operating net income and operating earnings per share
Management believes that operating net income, defined by the Company as net income plus reconciling items, and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provide investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in a way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Reconciling items include amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions, the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps, employee severance and facility consolidation costs, historical stock option granting practices investigation and related matters costs and current legal matters costs. Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below.
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.

Asset write-up depreciation expense on acquisitions
To mitigate the risk of interest-rate fluctuations associated with the Company's variable rate debt, the Company entered into two separate interest-rate swaps ("interest-rate swaps") that do not qualify as a cash flow hedge.

Change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps
The Company believes that incurring costs in the current period(s) in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services will result in a long-term positive impact on financial performance in the future.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
Item 5.02   Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
     (e) Each of the actions set forth in this Item 5.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K (this "Form 8-K") occurred on May 17, 2011.
     The Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Black Box Corporation (the "Company") recommended that the Board approve, and the Board approved, an annual incentive bonus plan (the "FY12 Annual Incentive Plan") under the Black Box Corporation 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2008 Plan") for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012 ("Fiscal 2012"). The performance goals for the FY12 Annual Incentive Plan are, as defined below, "operating earnings per share," "adjusted operating margin percent," "adjusted EBITDA" and "DSOs." "Operating earnings per share" means "operating net income" divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted) with "operating net income" meaning net income plus "Reconciling Items" (as defined below); "adjusted operating margin percent" means operating income plus Reconciling Items divided by total revenues; "adjusted EBITDA" means EBITDA (defined as net income plus provision for income taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization) plus Reconciling Items; and "DSOs" is an internal management calculation based on the balances in net accounts receivable, costs in excess of billings and billings in excess of costs at the end of the measurement period. "Reconciling Items" means: (i) amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) asset write-up expense on acquisitions; (iv) expenses, settlements, judgments and fines associated with material litigation ($500,000 or greater per matter); (v) changes in fair value of any interest-rate swaps; (vi) certain pension plan funding expenses; (vii) the impact of any goodwill impairment; and (viii) the effect of changes in tax laws or accounting principles affecting reported results.
     The performance goals for the FY12 Annual Incentive Plan will be equally weighted. Under the FY12 Annual Incentive Plan, the achievement of the performance goals at 80% of target (90% of target for the DSOs performance goal) will result in a payout of 50% of targeted annual bonus, the achievement of the performance goals at 100% of target will result in a payout of 100% of targeted annual bonus and the achievement of the performance goals at 120% of target (110% of target for the DSOs performance goal) will result in a payout of 150% of targeted annual bonus. The achievement of the performance goals at target levels between the levels of target performance stated above will result in payouts of targeted annual bonus amounts calculated on a straight-line basis. The Compensation Committee retained negative discretion to decrease the amount of any award earned under the FY12 Annual Incentive Plan.
     Following Board review and approval, the Compensation Committee made targeted annual bonus awards under the FY12 Annual Incentive Plan to the Company's executive officers as follows: R. Terry Blakemore, President and CEO  100% of base salary or $600,000; Michael McAndrew, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer  100% of base salary or $350,000; Kenneth P. Davis, Vice President  100% of base salary or $330,000; and Francis W. Wertheimber, Senior Vice President  approximately 50% of base salary or $133,000. Key, non-executive officer employees are also participating in the FY12 Annual Incentive Plan generally on the same terms as the executive officers.
 
     The Compensation Committee recommended that the Board approve, and the Board approved, a new Long-Term Incentive Program (the "FY12 LTIP") under the 2008 Plan for the three fiscal years ending March 31, 2014 (the "Performance Period"). The FY12 LTIP is comprised of a restricted stock unit grant payable in shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value $.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), representing 20% of the award, a stock option grant representing 30% of the award and performance share awards (the "Performance Awards") payable in shares of the Common Stock representing 50% of the award.
     The restricted stock units and stock options granted pursuant to the FY12 LTIP will vest in equal increments over three years. The performance goal for 50% of the Performance Awards is the Company's performance of a cumulative adjusted EBITDA goal (the "EBITDA Goal") and the performance goal for the remaining Performance Awards is the Company's total shareholder return ("TSR") relative to a peer group of companies for the Performance Period. For purposes of determining the payout of the Performance Awards: (A) the achievement of 75% of the EBITDA Goal will result in a payout of 50% of the Performance Awards subject to the EBITDA Goal, the achievement of 100% of the EBITDA Goal will result in a payout of 100% of the Performance Awards subject to the EBITDA Goal and the achievement of 120% of the EBITDA Goal will result in a payout of 150% of the Performance Awards subject to the EBITDA Goal; and (B) the ranking of the Company's TSR in the 35 percentile of the peer group's TSR will result in a payout of 50% of the Performance Awards subject to TSR, the ranking of the Company's TSR in the 55 percentile of the peer group's TSR will result in a payout of 100% of the Performance Awards subject to TSR, the ranking of the Company's TSR in the 75 percentile of the peer group's TSR will result in a payout of 150% of the Performance Awards subject to TSR and the ranking of the Company's TSR in the 100 percentile of the peer group's TSR will result in a payout of 200% of the Performance Awards subject to TSR. In the event of a negative Company TSR, the payout will be capped at 100% of the Performance Awards subject to TSR.

     Following Board review and approval, the Compensation Committee approved the following targeted amounts and awards (rounded to the nearest ten shares) under the FY12 LTIP to the Company's executive officers: Mr. Blakemore  $2,324,000 comprised of a restricted stock unit award for 14,350 shares of the Common Stock, a stock option grant for 56,150 shares of the Common Stock and Performance Awards for 34,030 shares of the Common Stock; Mr. McAndrew  $1,162,000 comprised of a restricted stock unit award for 7,180 shares of the Common Stock, a stock option grant for 28,080 shares of the Common Stock and Performance Awards for 17,010 shares of the Common Stock; Mr. Davis  $800,000 comprised of a restricted stock unit award for 4,940 shares of the Common Stock, a stock option grant for 19,330 shares of the Common Stock and Performance Awards for 11,710 shares of the Common Stock; and Mr. Wertheimber  $350,000 comprised of a restricted stock unit award for 2,160 shares of the Common Stock, a stock option grant for 8,460 shares of the Common Stock and Performance Awards for 5,120 shares of the Common Stock. Key, non-executive officer employees are also participating in the FY12 LTIP generally on the same relative basis as the executive officers.
     The foregoing awards under the 2008 Plan were granted on May 17, 2011.
 
Item 8.01   Other Events.
     Each of the actions set forth in this Item 8.01 of this Form 8-K occurred on May 17, 2011.
     Except for the annual retainer for the Chairs of the Governance Committee of the Board (the "Governance Committee") and the Nominating Committee of the Board (the "Nominating Committee"), the Board, upon the recommendation of the Governance Committee, made no changes in the compensation arrangements for the non-employee members of the Board. The following are such compensation arrangements effective for Fiscal 2012.
     In addition, on May 17, 2011, each non-employee director received an immediately-vested restricted stock unit award with a value of $100,000 on such date. Based on the closing price of the Common Stock on the date of grant (and rounding to the nearest ten shares), this grant resulted in a restricted stock unit award to each non-employee director for 3,090 shares of the Common Stock which vested immediately upon grant.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, August 2, 2011 - Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported results for the first quarter of Fiscal 2012 ended July 2, 2011.
First quarter of Fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share were 53 on net income of $9.6 million or 3.6% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of 75 on net income of $13.1 million or 5.0% of revenues for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 diluted earnings per share were 68 on net income of $12.3 million or 4.8% of revenues. Excluding reconciling items (which are identified below), operating earnings per share (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) for the first quarter of Fiscal 2012 were 60 on operating net income (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) of $10.9 million or 4.1% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of 84 on operating net income of $14.7 million or 5.6% of revenues for the same quarter last year.
First quarter of Fiscal 2012 pre-tax reconciling items were $2.1 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $1.3 million and 7, respectively. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2011, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $2.6 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $1.6 million and 9, respectively. See below for further discussion regarding Management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements and a detailed presentation of the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the periods presented above.
First quarter of Fiscal 2012 total revenues were $268 million, an increase of 2% from $264 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 total revenues were $255 million.
First quarter of Fiscal 2012 cash provided by operating activities was $14 million or 141% of net income, compared to $1 million or 10% of net income for the same quarter last year. First quarter of Fiscal 2012 free cash flow (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) was $12 million compared to $0.2 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 cash provided by operating activities was $19 million or 153% of net income and free cash flow was $22 million. Black Box utilized its first quarter of Fiscal 2012 free cash flow primarily to fund debt reduction of $8 million and to pay dividends of $1 million. Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company.
The Company's six-month order backlog was $230 million at July 2, 2011 compared to $229 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter-end comparison basis, the Company's six-month order backlog was $223 million at March 31, 2011.
For Fiscal 2012, the Company is targeting reported revenues of approximately $1.115 billion to $1.130 billion and corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of $3.25 to $3.40. Included in these projections is an effective tax rate of 38.0%. For the second quarter of Fiscal 2012, the Company is targeting reported revenues of approximately $278 million to $283 million and corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of 81 to 86. These targets exclude acquisition-related expense and the impact of changes in the fair market value of the Company's interest-rate swaps, and are before any new mergers and acquisition activity that has not been announced.
Commenting on the first quarter of Fiscal 2012 results and the second quarter of Fiscal 2012 outlook, Terry Blakemore, President
 
 
 
 
and Chief Executive Officer said, "The first quarter of Fiscal 2012 presented both strategic opportunities and near-term margin challenges for Black Box. Sequential revenue grew by 5% and we generated $14 million in cash flow from operating activities. We continued our growth plan of aggressively pursuing high quality engagements within our existing client base as well as with new strategic clients. In the long-term, we believe the incremental market share gain that will result from this approach will position Black Box to capture additional downstream quality client spend."
"In the first quarter, we saw our gross margins decrease which is attributable to our strategic pricing initiative. I am confident that obtaining these new engagements will ultimately result in a return to historic adjusted operating income levels."
The Company will conduct a conference call beginning at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time today, August 2, 2011. Terry Blakemore, President and Chief Executive Officer, will host the call.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
As a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures such as free cash flow, operating net income, operating earnings per share ("EPS"), Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income and same-office revenue comparisons to illustrate the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided explanations of the Company's management ("Management") regarding their use and the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which are provided below.
Management uses non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and (e) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members. Moreover, the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, they do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash change in fair value of the Company's interest-rate swaps which will continue to impact the Company's earnings until the interest-rate swaps are settled and (iv) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow
Free cash flow is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, plus proceeds from stock option exercises. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
Net capital expenditures
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be taken into account along with cash provided by operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures are typically material and directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.
Foreign currency exchange impact on cash
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to U.S. dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive and/or negative impact of such adjustments as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in U.S. dollars.
Proceeds from stock option exercises
The Company believes that proceeds from stock option exercises should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the actual cash available to the Company. The Company has demonstrated a recurring inflow of cash related to its stock-based compensation plans and, since this cash is immediately available to the Company, it directly impacts the availability of the Company's operating cash. The amount of proceeds from stock option exercises is dependent upon a number of variables, including the number and exercise price of outstanding options and the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the timing of stock option exercises is under the control of the individual option holder and is not in the control of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of any proceeds from stock option exercises.

A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
 
Operating net income and operating earnings per share
Management believes that operating net income, defined by the Company as net income plus reconciling items, and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provide investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in a way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Reconciling items include amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions and the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps each of which are non-cash charges. Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below.
Amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps
To mitigate the risk of interest-rate fluctuations associated with the Company's variable rate debt, the Company entered into two separate interest-rate swaps ("interest-rate swaps") that do not qualify as a cash flow hedge. Thus, the Company records the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps as an asset/liability within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with the offset to Interest expense (income) within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Management excludes this non-cash expense and the related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
The following table represents the Company's pre-tax reconciling items:
 
A reconciliation of net income to operating net income is presented below:

The effective tax rate utilized to determine Reconciling items, after tax, for each period, is the effective tax rate utilized to determine Net income for such period.

A reconciliation of diluted EPS to operating EPS is presented below:
 
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
Management believes that EBITDA, defined as Net income plus provision for income taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization, is a widely accepted measure of profitability that may be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Adjusted EBITDA, defined as EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense, may also be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Stock-based compensation is an integral part of ongoing operations since it is considered similar to other types of compensation to employees. However, Management believes that varying levels of stock-based compensation expense could result in misleading period-over-period comparisons and is providing an adjusted disclosure which excludes stock-based compensation.
A reconciliation of income before provision for income taxes to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is presented below:

Supplemental Information
The following supplemental information, including geographical segment results, service type results, same-office revenue comparisons and significant balance sheet ratios and other information is being provided for comparisons of reported results for the first quarter of Fiscal 2012, fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 and first quarter of Fiscal 2011. All dollar amounts are in thousands unless noted otherwise.
Geographical Segment Results
Management is presented with and reviews revenues, operating income and adjusted operating income by geographical segment. Adjusted operating income is defined by the Company as operating income plus reconciling items. Reconciling items include amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions. See above for additional details provided by Management regarding non-GAAP financial measures. Revenues, operating income and adjusted operating income for North America, Europe and All Other are presented below:

Service Type Results
Management is presented with and reviews revenues and gross profit for Data Infrastructure, Voice Communications and Technology Products which are presented below:
 
Same-office revenue comparisons
Management is presented with and reviews revenues on a same-office basis which excludes the effects of revenues from acquisitions. While the information provided below is presented on a consolidated basis, all of the revenue from offices added as shown below relates to Voice Communications in the Company's North America segment. Reported same-office comparisons of consolidated revenues, therefore, can be determined by excluding the revenues for Voice Communications in the Company's North America segment from offices added since April 1, 2010 (for comparison of 1Q12 to 1Q11) or January 2, 2011 (for comparison of 1Q12 to 4Q11) as shown below.
Information on quarterly revenues on a same-office basis compared to the same period last year is presented below:
 
Information on revenues on a same-office basis compared to the sequential quarter is presented below:

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, November 1, 2011 - Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported results for the second quarter of Fiscal 2012 ended October 1, 2011.
Second quarter of Fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share were 83 on net income of $14.8 million or 5.2% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of 77 on net income of $13.6 million or 5.0% of revenues for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, first quarter of Fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share were 53 on net income of $9.6 million or 3.6% of revenues. Excluding reconciling items (which are identified below), operating earnings per share (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) for the second quarter of Fiscal 2012 were 93 on operating net income (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) of $16.6 million or 5.8% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of 86 on operating net income of $15.2 million or 5.6% of revenues for the same quarter last year.
Second quarter of Fiscal 2012 pre-tax reconciling items were $2.6 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $1.8 million and 10, respectively. During the second quarter of Fiscal 2011, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $2.7 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $1.7 million and 9, respectively. See below for further discussion regarding Management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements and a detailed presentation of the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the periods presented above. Included in our second quarter and year-to-date Fiscal 2012 results is a $1.6 million reduction in our provision for income taxes primarily related to the settlement of an Internal Revenue Service audit for Fiscal 2007 through Fiscal 2010. This reduction increased second quarter and year-to-date Fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share and operating earnings per share by 9 each.
Second quarter of Fiscal 2012 total revenues were $287 million, an increase of 5% from $273 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, first quarter of Fiscal 2012 total revenues were $268 million.
Second quarter of Fiscal 2012 cash used for operating activities was $0.3 million or (2)% of net income, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $7 million or 51% of net income for the same quarter last year. Second quarter of Fiscal 2012 free cash flow (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) was $(3) million compared to $7 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, first quarter of Fiscal 2012 cash provided by operating activities was $14 million or 141% of net income and free cash flow was $12 million. During the second quarter of Fiscal 2012, Black Box invested $13 million in acquisition activity, $8 million to repurchase its common stock and $1 million to pay dividends. Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company.

For the six (6) month period ending October 1, 2011, diluted earnings per share were $1.36 on net income of $24.5 million or 4.4% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.51 on net income of $26.7 million or 5.0% of revenues for the same period last year. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share for the six (6) month period ending October 1, 2011 were $1.53 on operating net income of $27.6 million or 5.0% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of $1.70 on operating net income of $30.0 million or 5.6% of revenues for the same period last year.
For the six (6) month period ending October 1, 2011, pre-tax reconciling items were $4.7 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $3.1 million and 17, respectively. For the six (6) month period ending October 2, 2010, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $5.3 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $3.3 million and 19, respectively.
For the six (6) month period ending October 1, 2011, total revenues were $556 million, an increase of 4% from $537 million for the same period last year.
For the six (6) month period ending October 1, 2011, cash provided by operating activities was $13 million or 54% of net income, compared to $8 million or 30% of net income for the same period last year. For the six (6) month period ending October 1, 2011, free cash flow was $9 million compared to $8 million for the same period last year. For the six (6) month period ending October 1, 2011, Black Box invested $14 million in acquisition activity, $10 million to repurchase its common stock and $2 million to pay dividends.
The Company's six-month order backlog was $223 million at October 1, 2011 compared to $213 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter-end comparison basis, the Company's six-month order backlog was $230 million at July 2, 2011.
For Fiscal 2012, the Company is targeting reported revenues of approximately $1.105 billion to $1.115 billion and corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of $3.10 to $3.20. Included in these projections is an effective tax rate of 38.0%. For the third quarter of Fiscal 2012, the Company is targeting reported revenues of approximately $280 million to $285 million and corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of 77 to 82. These targets exclude acquisition-related expense and the impact of changes in the fair market value of the Company's interest-rate swaps, and are before any new mergers and acquisition activity that has not been announced.
Commenting on the second quarter of Fiscal 2012 results and the third quarter of Fiscal 2012 outlook, Terry Blakemore, President and Chief Executive Officer said, "I am pleased to report record revenue and organic growth in our commercial sector for the second quarter of our fiscal year.

"During the quarter, we returned $10 million to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividend payments. We remain committed to increasing shareholder return and will continue to invest in our core business while pursuing additional strategic acquisitions."

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
As a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures such as free cash flow, operating net income, operating earnings per share ("EPS"), Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income and same-office revenue comparisons to illustrate the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided explanations of the Company's management ("Management") regarding their use and the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which are provided below.
Management uses non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and (e) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members. Moreover, the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, they do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash change in fair value of the Company's interest-rate swaps which will continue to impact the Company's earnings until the interest-rate swaps are settled and (iv) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
Free cash flow
Free cash flow is defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, plus proceeds from stock option exercises. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
Net capital expenditures
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be taken into account along with cash provided by operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures are typically material and directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.
Foreign currency exchange impact on cash
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to U.S. dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive and/or negative impact of such adjustments as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in U.S. dollars.
Proceeds from stock option exercises
The Company believes that proceeds from stock option exercises should be added to cash provided by operating activities to more accurately reflect the actual cash available to the Company. The Company has demonstrated a recurring inflow of cash related to its stock-based compensation plans and, since this cash is immediately available to the Company, it directly impacts the availability of the Company's operating cash. The amount of proceeds from stock option exercises is dependent upon a number of variables, including the number and exercise price of outstanding options and the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the timing of stock option exercises is under the control of the individual option holder and is not in the control of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of any proceeds from stock option exercises.
 
7                                                                          
 
 
A reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
 
Operating net income and operating earnings per share
Management believes that operating net income, defined by the Company as net income plus reconciling items, and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provide investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in a way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Reconciling items include amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions and the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps each of which are non-cash charges. Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below.
Amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps
To mitigate the risk of interest-rate fluctuations associated with the Company's variable rate debt, the Company entered into two separate interest-rate swaps ("interest-rate swaps") that do not qualify as a cash flow hedge. Thus, the Company records the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps as an asset/liability within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with the offset to Interest expense (income) within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Management excludes this non-cash expense and the related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
The following table represents the Company's pre-tax reconciling items:
 
 
8                                                                          
 
 
A reconciliation of net income to operating net income is presented below:

The effective tax rate utilized to determine Reconciling items, after tax, for each period, is the effective tax rate utilized to determine Net income for such period.
A reconciliation of diluted EPS to operating EPS is presented below:
 
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
Management believes that EBITDA, defined as Net income plus provision for income taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization, is a widely accepted measure of profitability that may be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Adjusted EBITDA, defined as EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense, may also be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Stock-based compensation is an integral part of ongoing operations since it is considered similar to other types of compensation to employees. However, Management believes that varying levels of stock-based compensation expense could result in misleading period-over-period comparisons and is providing an adjusted disclosure which excludes stock-based compensation.
A reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is presented below:
 
 
9

Geographical Segment Results
Management is presented with and reviews revenues, operating income and adjusted operating income by geographical segment.

Item 2.06
    
Material Impairments.
On January 23, 2012, Black Box Corporation (the Company), after consultation by Company management with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, concluded that the Company will record a non-cash, pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of approximately $320 million (consisting of approximately $280 million and approximately $40 million in its North America and Europe reporting units, respectively) during the third quarter ended December 31, 2011 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012 (Fiscal 2012) as a result of its annual goodwill assessment conducted as of October 1, 2011. The Company does not expect the impairment charge to impact its business operations, compliance with debt covenants or future cash flows, or to result in any current or future cash expenditures.
Beginning in 1998 and continuing through the present time, the Company has pursued a strategy to expand its technical capabilities and geographic footprint to include Data Infrastructure and Voice Communications solutions in North America and Data Infrastructure solutions in Europe by acquiring over one hundred companies that resulted in recording goodwill on its balance sheet. The North America and Europe reporting units continue to operate profitably and generate positive cash flow from operations, and the Company expects that each will continue to do so in Fiscal 2012 and beyond. However, the current fair value, derived from a discounted cash flow model, of the North America and Europe reporting units do not support the book value of goodwill recorded from those acquisitions. The primary factors contributing to the difference in fair value to book value were an increased weighted-average cost of capital for North America (primarily driven by an increase in the risk premium associated with the Company's industry segment relative to a control group) and lower profitability as a result of competitive market conditions for both North America and Europe.
In determining the impairment charge, the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill was compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill. The implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill was determined as the residual between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of its assets (including any unrecognized intangible assets) and liabilities as of the annual goodwill assessment date.
The Company further believes that, although it will record the impairment charge, the acquisition strategy for the North America and Europe reporting units was an appropriate use of capital to expand the Company's geographic scope, breadth of services and technical expertise.  The Company anticipates that it will continue to target acquisitions as part of a comprehensive strategy to expand its product and service offerings.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, January 31, 2012 - Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX) today reported results for the third quarter of Fiscal 2012 ended December 31, 2011.
Third quarter of Fiscal 2012 diluted loss per share was $16.12 on a net loss of $283.4 million or (102.7)% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of 78 on net income of $13.9 million or 5.0% of revenues for the same quarter last year. As previously disclosed, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of Fiscal 2012 ($317.8 million, pre-tax and $296.0 million, after-tax). On a sequential quarter comparison basis, second quarter of Fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share were 83 on net income of $14.8 million or 5.2% of revenues. Excluding reconciling items (which are identified below), operating earnings per share (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) for the third quarter of Fiscal 2012 were 85 on operating net income (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) of $15.0 million or 5.4% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of 84 on operating net income of $15.0 million or 5.4% of revenues for the same quarter last year.
Third quarter of Fiscal 2012 pre-tax reconciling items including the goodwill impairment charge were $321.8 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $298.5 million and $16.97, respectively. During the third quarter of Fiscal 2011, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $1.8 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $1.1 million and 6, respectively. See below for further discussion regarding Management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements and a detailed presentation of the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the periods presented above.
Third quarter of Fiscal 2012 total revenues were $276 million, relatively equivalent to $277 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, second quarter of Fiscal 2012 total revenues were $287 million.
Third quarter of Fiscal 2012 cash provided by operating activities was $30.6 million or (11)% of net loss, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $28 million or 201% of net income for the same quarter last year. Third quarter of Fiscal 2012 free cash flow (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) was $27 million compared to $31 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, second quarter of Fiscal 2012 cash used for operating activities was $0.3 million or (2)% of net income and free cash flow was $(3) million. During the third quarter of Fiscal 2012, Black Box invested $21 million to pay down debt, $5 million to repurchase its common stock and $1 million to pay dividends.
For the nine (9) month period ended December 31, 2011, diluted loss per share was $14.54 on a net loss of $259.0 million or (31.1)% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of $2.30 on net income of $40.6 million or 5.0% of revenues for the same period last year. Excluding reconciling items, operating earnings per share for the nine (9) month period ended December 31, 2011 were $2.38 on operating net income of $42.6 million or 5.1% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of $2.55 on operating net income of $45.0 million or 5.5% of revenues for the same period last year.

For the nine (9) month period ended January 1, 2011, the Company's pre-tax reconciling items were $7.1 million with an after-tax impact on net income and EPS of $4.4 million and 25, respectively. Included in our results for the nine (9) month period ended December 31, 2011 is a $1.6 million reduction in our provision for income taxes primarily related to the settlement of an Internal Revenue Service audit for Fiscal 2007 through Fiscal 2010. This reduction increased nine (9) month period ended December 31, 2011 diluted earnings per share and operating earnings per share by 9 each.
For the nine (9) month period ended December 31, 2011, total revenues were $832 million, an increase of 2% from $813 million for the same period last year.

For the nine (9) month period ended December 31, 2011, free cash flow was $36 million compared to $39 million for the same period last year. For the nine (9) month period ended December 31, 2011, Black Box invested $15 million in acquisition activity, $15 million to repurchase its common stock, $8 million to pay down debt and $4 million to pay dividends.
The Company's six-month order backlog was $208 million at December 31, 2011, including $11.5 million from the acquisition of InnerWireless, Inc. announced earlier today, compared to $212 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter-end comparison basis, the Company's six-month order backlog was $223 million at October 1, 2011.
For Fiscal 2012, the Company is targeting reported revenues of approximately $1.092 billion to $1.097 billion and corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of $3.07 to $3.12. Included in these projections is an effective tax rate of 38.0%. For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012, the Company is targeting reported revenues of approximately $260 million to $265 million and corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of 70 to 75. These targets include the impact from our acquisition of InnerWireless, Inc. announced earlier today and exclude acquisition-related expense and the impact of changes in the fair market value of the Company's interest-rate swaps, and are before any new mergers and acquisition activity that has not been announced.
Commenting on the third quarter of Fiscal 2012 results and the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012 outlook, Terry Blakemore, President and Chief Executive Officer said, "I am pleased with our strong positive cash flow and improving operating margins in the current quarter."

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
As a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures such as free cash flow, operating net income, operating earnings per share ("EPS"), Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") (as adjusted), Adjusted EBITDA (as adjusted), adjusted operating income and same-office revenue comparisons to illustrate the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided explanations of the Company's management ("Management") regarding their use and the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which are provided below.
Management uses non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and (e) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members. Moreover, the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, they do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash change in fair value of the Company's interest-rate swaps which will continue to impact the Company's earnings until the interest-rate swaps are settled (iv) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash goodwill impairment and (v) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow
Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by (used for) operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
Net capital expenditures
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be taken into account along with cash provided by (used for) operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.
Foreign currency exchange impact on cash
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to U.S. dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive or negative impact of such adjustments as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in U.S. dollars.
 
Proceeds from stock option exercises
The Company believes that proceeds from stock option exercises should be added to cash provided by (used for) operating activities to more accurately reflect the actual cash available to the Company. The Company has demonstrated a recurring inflow of cash related to its stock-based compensation plans and, since this cash is immediately available to the Company, it directly impacts the availability of the Company's operating cash. The amount of proceeds from stock option exercises is dependent upon a number of variables, including the number and exercise price of outstanding options and the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the timing of stock option exercises is under the control of the individual option holder and is not in the control of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of any proceeds from stock option exercises.
A reconciliation of cash provided by (used for) operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
 
Operating net income and operating earnings per share
Management believes that operating net income, defined by the Company as net income (loss) plus reconciling items, and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provide investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in a way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Reconciling items include amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps and goodwill impairment, each of which are non-cash charges. Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below.
Amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps
To mitigate the risk of interest-rate fluctuations associated with the Company's variable rate debt, the Company enters into interest-rate swaps ("interest-rate swaps") that do not qualify as a cash flow hedge. Thus, the Company records the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps as an asset/liability within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with the offset to Interest expense (income) within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Management excludes this non-cash expense and the related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Goodwill impairment
The Company incurred a loss due to goodwill impairment in its North America and Europe reporting segments. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
 
The following table represents the Company's pre-tax reconciling items:
 
A reconciliation of net income to operating net income is presented below:
 
1
The effective tax rate utilized to determine Reconciling items, after tax, is the effective tax rate utilized to determine Net income with the exception of third quarter and year-to-date Fiscal 2012 which excludes the tax impacts of the goodwill impairment loss.
A reconciliation of diluted EPS to operating EPS is presented below:
 
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
Management believes that EBITDA (as adjusted), defined as Net income (loss) plus provision for income taxes, interest, depreciation, amortization and goodwill impairment, is a widely accepted measure of profitability that may be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Adjusted EBITDA (as adjusted), defined as EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense, may also be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Stock-based compensation is an integral part of ongoing operations since it is considered similar to other types of compensation to employees. However, Management believes that varying levels of stock-based compensation expense could result in misleading period-over-period comparisons and is providing an adjusted disclosure which excludes stock-based compensation.
A reconciliation of net income to EBITDA (as adjusted) and Adjusted EBITDA (as adjusted) is presented below:
 
 
Supplemental Information
The following supplemental information, including geographical segment results, service type results, same-office revenue comparisons and significant balance sheet ratios and other information is being provided for comparisons of reported results for the third quarter of Fiscal 2012, second quarter of Fiscal 2012, third quarter of Fiscal 2011 and third quarter year-to-date Fiscal 2012 and 2011. All dollar amounts are in thousands unless noted otherwise.
Geographical Segment Results
Management is presented with and reviews revenues, operating income (loss) and adjusted operating income by geographical segment. Adjusted operating income is defined by the Company as operating income plus reconciling items. Reconciling items include amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions and goodwill impairment. See above for additional details provided by Management regarding non-GAAP financial measures. Revenues, operating income and adjusted operating income for North America, Europe and All Other are presented below:
 
 
Service Type Results
Management is presented with and reviews revenues and gross profit for Data Infrastructure, Voice Communications and Technology Products which are presented below:
 
Same-office revenue comparisons
Management is presented with and reviews revenues on a same-office basis which excludes the effects of revenues from acquisitions. While the information provided below is presented on a consolidated basis, all of the revenue from offices added as shown below relates to Voice Communications in the Company's North America segment. Reported same-office comparisons of consolidated revenues, therefore, can be determined by excluding the revenues for Voice Communications in the Company's North America segment from offices added since April 1, 2010 (for comparison of 3Q12 to 3Q11 and 3QYTD12 to 3QYTD11) or April 1, 2011 (for comparison of 3Q12 to 2Q12) as shown below.
Information on quarterly revenues on a same-office basis compared to the same period last year is presented below:
 
Information on quarterly revenues on a same-office basis compared to the sequential quarter is presented below:
 
 
Information on year-to-date revenues on a same-office basis compared to the same period last year is presented below:
 
Significant Balance Sheet ratios and Other Information

On March 23, 2012, Black Box Corporation ("Parent" or "Borrower") and certain directly or indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries of Parent (collectively, the "Guarantors" and together with Parent, the "Loan Parties") entered into a revolving senior credit facility (the "Loan Facility") in the form of a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania, as administrative agent ("Agent"), and certain other lender parties (together with the Agent, the "Lenders").
Borrowings under the Loan Facility are permitted up to a maximum amount of $400,000,000, including up to $25,000,000 of swingline loans and $25,000,000 of letters of credit. The Loan Facility may be increased by Borrower up to an additional $100,000,000 with the approval of the Lenders and may be unilaterally and permanently reduced by Borrower to not less than the then outstanding amount of all borrowings (including letters of credit and swingline loans) under the Loan Facility upon not less than ten business days' written notice.
Initial borrowings under the Loan Facility were used to refinance the existing credit facility of certain subsidiaries of Parent. Borrowings under the Loan Facility may also be used for acquisitions, to provide Parent funds for the repurchase of its common stock and for other general corporate purposes.
The Loan Facility is unsecured, but is guaranteed by all of Parent's directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries that are incorporated (or organized) under the laws of the District of Columbia or under the laws of any state or commonwealth of the United States.
Interest on outstanding indebtedness under the Loan Facility currently accrues, at the Company's option, at a rate based on either: (a) the greater of (i) the prime rate per annum of Agent then in effect and (ii) 0.50% the rate per annum announced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as being the weighted average of the rates on overnight Federal funds transactions arranged by Federal funds brokers on the previous trading day, in each case 0% to .75% (determined by a leverage ratio based on the Parent's consolidated EBITDA) or (b) a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR rate 0.875% to 1.750% (determined by a leverage ratio based on the Parent's consolidated EBITDA).

Agent's Clawback
(a)        .  Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any borrowing of Loans that such Lender will not make available to the Agent such Lender's share of such borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.03 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable borrowing available to the Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable borrowing to the Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Agent.
Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Agent
(b)        .  Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

WHEREAS, it is a condition precedent to the extension of credit under the Credit Agreement that the Guarantors execute and deliver this Agreement; and
WHEREAS, this Agreement, among other things, is made by the Guarantors to induce the Lenders to enter into the Loan Documents (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and to induce the Lenders to extend credit under the Credit Agreement.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged by each Guarantor, and intending to be legally bound, each Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:
1.01.      
Definitions.
(a)          .  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given in the Credit Agreement. In addition to the other terms defined elsewhere in this Agreement, as used herein the following terms shall have the following meanings:
Certain Definitions

Without limitation of the foregoing, such obligations include all obligations arising from any extensions of credit under or in connection with the Loan Documents from time to time, regardless of whether any such extensions of credit are in excess of the amount committed under or contemplated by the Loan Documents or are made in circumstances in which any condition to extension of credit is not satisfied. Without limitation of the foregoing, any of the Lenders (or any successive assignee or transferee) from time to time may assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of their rights or obligations under the Loan Documents in accordance with Section 10.14 of the Credit Agreement (including, without limitation, all or any portion of any commitment to extend credit), or any other Guaranteed Obligations, to any other Person, and such Guaranteed Obligations (including, without limitation, any Guaranteed Obligations resulting from extension of credit by such other Person under or in connection with the Loan Documents) shall be and remain Guaranteed Obligations entitled to the benefit of the Credit Agreement.
Guaranteed Obligations

This Agreement is an agreement of suretyship as well as of guaranty, is a guarantee of payment and performance and not merely of collectibility, and is in no way conditioned upon any attempt to collect from or proceed against the Borrower or any other Person or any other event or circumstance. The obligations of the Guarantors under this Agreement are direct and primary obligations of each Guarantor and are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations, and a separate action or actions may be brought against any Guarantor regardless of whether action is brought against the Borrower or any other Person or whether the Borrower or any other Person is joined in any such action or actions.
Guaranty and Suretyship
2.03.      .  Each Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid and performed strictly in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting the Guaranteed Obligations, any of the terms of the Loan Documents or the rights of the Agent or any Lender or any other Person with respect thereto. The obligations of the Guarantors under
Obligations Absolute
this Agreement shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, irrespective of any of the following:
(a)        any lack of legality, validity, enforceability, allowability (in a bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, dissolution or similar proceeding, or otherwise), or any avoidance or subordination, in whole or in part, of any Loan Document or any of the Guaranteed Obligations;
(b)        any change in the amount, nature, time, place or manner of payment or performance of, or in any other term of, any of the Guaranteed Obligations (whether or not such change is contemplated by the Loan Documents as presently constituted, and specifically including any increase in the Guaranteed Obligations, whether resulting from the extension of additional credit to the Borrower or otherwise), any execution of any additional Loan Documents or any amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any Loan Document;
(c)        any taking, exchange, release, impairment or nonperfection of any collateral, or any taking, release, impairment or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guaranty or other direct or indirect security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations;
(d)        any manner of application of collateral or other direct or indirect security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or proceeds thereof, to any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any commercially reasonable manner of sale or other disposition of any collateral for any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other assets of the Borrower;
(e)        any permanent impairment by any Lender or any other Person of any recourse of the Guarantor against the Borrower or any other Person, or any other permanent impairment by any Lender or any other Person of the suretyship status of the Guarantor;
(f)        any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, dissolution or similar proceedings with respect to, or any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate structure or existence of, the Borrower, any Guarantor or any other Person; or
(g)        any failure of any Lender or any other Person to disclose to any Guarantor any information pertaining to the business, operations, condition (financial or other) or prospects of the Borrower or any other Person, or to give any other notice, disclosure or demand.
2.04.    .  Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defense to or limitation on its obligations under this Agreement arising out of or based upon any matter referred to in Section 2.2 and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any requirement of promptness, diligence or notice of acceptance, any other notice, disclosure or demand with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations and this Agreement, any requirement of acceptance hereof, reliance hereon or knowledge hereof by the Agent or any Lender, and any requirement that the Agent or any Lender protect, secure, perfect or insure any lien or any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against the Borrower or any other Person or any collateral or other direct or indirect security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, each Guarantor's waiver under this Section 2.3 shall apply only to each Guarantor's obligations hereunder and shall not limit or waive any of such Guarantor's subrogation rights.
Waivers, etc
2.05.    .  This Agreement shall continue to be effective, or be automatically reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is avoided, rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Agent or any Lender for any reason, all as though such payment had not been made.
Reinstatement
2.06.    .  Without limiting the generality of any other provision of this Agreement, if any acceleration of the time for payment or performance of any Guaranteed Obligation, or any condition to any such acceleration, shall at any time be stayed, enjoined or prevented for any reason (including stay or injunction resulting from the pendency against the Borrower or any other Person of a bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, dissolution or similar proceeding), each Guarantor agrees that, for purposes of this Agreement and its obligations hereunder, at the option of the Agent such Guaranteed Obligation shall be deemed to have been accelerated and such condition to acceleration shall be deemed to have been met.
No Stay
2.07.    .  All payments to be made by the Guarantors pursuant to this Agreement shall be made at the times and in the manner prescribed for payments in Articles II and III of the Credit Agreement, without setoff, counterclaim, withholding or other deduction of any nature.

Payments
2.08.    .  Any rights which any Guarantor may have or acquire by way of subrogation, reimbursement, restitution, exoneration, contribution or indemnity, and any similar rights (whether arising by operation of law, by agreement or otherwise), against the Borrower arising from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of any of the obligations of any Guarantor under or in connection with this Agreement, shall be subordinate in right of payment to the Guaranteed Obligations, and the Guarantors shall not exercise any such rights until all Guaranteed Obligations and all other obligations under this Agreement have been paid in cash or such other manner as may be acceptable to the Agent and performed in full and all commitments to extend credit under, and all Letters of Credit issued under, the Loan Documents shall have terminated. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, any amount shall be received by any Guarantor on account of any such rights at any time prior to the time at which all Guaranteed Obligations and all other obligations under this Agreement shall have been paid in cash or such other manner as may be acceptable to the Agent and performed in full and all commitments to extend credit under, and all Letters of Credit issued under, the Loan Documents shall have terminated, such amount shall be held by such Guarantor in trust for the benefit of the Lenders, segregated from other funds held by such Guarantor, and shall be forthwith delivered to Agent for the benefit of the Lenders in the exact form received by such Guarantor (with any necessary endorsement), to be applied to the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as the Agent may elect, or to be held by the Agent as security for the Guaranteed Obligations and disposed of by the Agent in any lawful manner, all as the Agent may elect.
Subrogation. Etc
2.09.    .  This Agreement is a continuing guaranty and shall continue in full force and effect until all Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Agreement have been paid in cash or such other manner as may be acceptable to the Agent and performed in full, and all commitments to extend credit under, and all Letters of Credit issued under, the Loan Documents have terminated, subject in any event to reinstatement in accordance with Section 2.4. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any right to terminate or revoke this Agreement.
Continuing Agreement
2.10.    .  Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, to the extent that mandatory and nonwaivable provisions of applicable Law pertaining to fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance otherwise would render the full amount of the obligations of the Guarantors under this Agreement avoidable, invalid or unenforceable, the obligations of each Guarantor under this Agreement shall be limited to the maximum amount which does not result in such avoidability, invalidity or unenforceability. In any action, suit or proceeding pertaining to this Agreement, the burden of proof, by clear and convincing evidence, shall be on the Person claiming that this Section 2.9 applies to limit any obligation of any Guarantor under this Agreement, or claiming that any obligation of any Guarantor under this Agreement is avoidable, invalid or unenforceable, as to each element of such claim.
Limitation on Obligations

Failure by the Agent to receive notice from any Guarantor to the contrary before the Lenders make any extension of credit under any Loan Document shall constitute a further representation and warranty by the Guarantors to the Agent and the Lenders that the representations and warranties made by the Guarantors in this Article III are true and correct on and as of the date of such extension of credit with the same effect as though made on and as of such date.
Representations and Warranties Remade at Each Extension of Credit

Any such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.
Amendments, etc
5.15.    .  No delay or failure of the Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy.

No Implied Waiver: Remedies Cumulative

Such right shall be absolute and unconditional in all circumstances and, without limitation, shall exist whether such obligation to such Guarantor is absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured (it being agreed that each Lender may deem such obligation to be then due and payable at the time of such setoff), regardless of the offices or branches through which the parties are acting with respect to the offset obligations, regardless of whether the offset obligations are denominated in the same or different currencies and regardless of the existence or adequacy of any other direct or indirect security or any other right or remedy available to such Lender. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be deemed a waiver of or restriction on any right of setoff or banker's lien available to any Lender under this Section 5.8, at law or otherwise. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that any affiliate of any Lender, and any holder of a participation in any Guaranteed Obligations of any Guarantor under this Agreement, shall have the same rights of setoff as each Lender as provided in this Section 5.8 (regardless of whether such affiliate or participant otherwise would be deemed a creditor of such Guarantor).

Section and other references in this Agreement are to this Agreement unless otherwise specified. This Agreement has been fully negotiated between the applicable parties, each party having the benefit of legal counsel, and accordingly neither any doctrine of construction of guaranties or suretyships in favor of the guarantor or surety, nor any doctrine of
Construction
construction of ambiguities against the party controlling the drafting, shall apply to this Agreement.
5.23.    .  This Agreement shall be binding upon each Guarantor, its successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Agent, the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Agent or any Lender (and any successive assignee or transferee) from time to time may assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights or obligations under the Loan Documents (including all or any portion of any commitment to extend credit), or any Guaranteed Obligations, to any other Person, and such Guaranteed Obligations (including any Guaranteed Obligations resulting from extension of credit by such other Person under or in connection with the Loan Documents) shall be and remain Guaranteed Obligations entitled to the benefit of this Agreement, and to the extent of its interest in such Guaranteed Obligations such other Person shall be vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to the Agent or any Lender, as the case may be, in this Agreement or otherwise.

In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the [Company] [Guarantor], or in the event of any receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization or arrangement with creditors, whether or not pursuant to bankruptcy laws, sale of all or substantially all of the assets or any other marshalling of the assets and liabilities of the [Company] [Guarantor], (i) Senior Debt and Post-petition Interest, if any, shall first be paid in full before the Subordinated Lender shall be entitled to receive any moneys, dividends or other assets in any such proceeding, and (ii) the Subordinated Lender will at the request of the Agent, file any claim, proof of claim or other instrument of similar character necessary to enforce the obligations of the [Company] [Guarantor] in respect of Subordinated Debt and will hold in trust for Agent and the Lenders and pay over to the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders, in the form received, to be applied on Senior Debt and Post-petition Interest, any and all moneys, dividends or other assets received in any proceeding on account of Subordinated Debt, unless and until Senior Debt and Post-petition Interest shall be paid in full. In the event the Subordinated Lender shall fail to take such action requested by the Agent, the Agent may as attorney-in-fact for the Subordinated Lender, take such action on behalf of the Subordinated Lender, and the Subordinated Lender appoints the Lender as attorney-in-fact for the Subordinated Lender to demand, sue for, collect and receive any and all such moneys, dividends or other assets and give acquittance therefor and to file any claim, proof of claim or other instrument of similar character and to take such other action (including acceptance or rejection of any plan of reorganization or arrangement) in the name of the Agent and the Lenders or in the name of the Subordinated Lender as the Agent may deem necessary or advisable for the enforcement of these subordination terms; and the Subordinated Lender will execute and deliver to the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders such other and further powers of attorney or other instruments as the Agent may request in order to accomplish the foregoing.
6.         To the extent that the [Company] [Guarantor] or any other Person makes any payment on the Senior Debt that is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential or set aside or is required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization act, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause (such payment being hereinafter referred to as a ""), then to the extent of
Voided Payment
such Voided Payment, that portion of the Senior Debt that had been previously satisfied by such Voided Payment shall be revived and continue in full force and effect as if such Voided Payment had never been made. In the event that a Voided Payment is recovered from the Lenders, an Event of Default shall be deemed to have existed and to be continuing under the Loan Documents from the date of the Agent's initial receipt of such Voided Payment until the full amount of such Voided Payment is restored to the Lenders. During any continuance of any such Event of Default, these subordination terms shall be in full force and effect with respect to the Subordinated Debt. To the extent that the Subordinated Lender has received any payments with respect to the Subordinated Debt subsequent to the date of the Agent's initial receipt of such Voided Payment and such payments have not been invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential or set aside or are required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver, or any other party under any bankruptcy act, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, the Subordinated Lender shall be obligated and hereby agrees that any such payment so made or received shall be deemed to have been received in trust for the benefit of the Lenders, and the Subordinated Lender shall pay to the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders, upon demand, the full amount so received by the Subordinated Lender during such period of time to the extent necessary fully to restore to the Lenders the amount of such Voided Payment.
7.         Any holder of the Senior Debt may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Subordinated Lender, without incurring responsibility to the Subordinated Lender, and without impairing or releasing the rights of any of the holders of the Senior Debt, or any of the obligations of the Subordinated Lender hereunder:
(a)        change the amount, manner, place or terms of payment or change or extend the time of payment of or renew or alter Senior Debt or amend the Loan Documents in any manner or enter into or amend in any manner any other agreement relating to Senior Debt (including provisions restricting or further restricting payments of principal of and interest on Subordinated Debt);
(b)        sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property by whomsoever at any time pledged or mortgaged to secure, or howsoever securing, Senior Debt;
(c)        release anyone liable in any manner for the payment or collection of Senior Debt, including any Person who may have guaranteed the Senior Debt;
(d)        exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Borrower and others (including the Subordinated Lender); and
(e)        apply any sums by whomsoever paid or however realized to Senior Debt.
8.         Notice of acceptance of these subordination terms shall be waived by the Subordinated Lender.
9.         The [Company] [Guarantor] and Subordinated Lender will cause all Subordinated Debt to be evidenced by a note or other instrument which shall bear upon its face a statement or legend to the effect that such note or other instrument is subordinated to Senior Debt in the manner and to the extent set forth in these subordination terms, and will mark its books to show that the Subordinated Debt is so subordinated to Senior Debt.
10.       Prior to the incurrence of any Subordinated Debt the Subordinated Lender will execute and deliver to the Agent an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent evidencing the Subordinated Lender's agreement to the foregoing terms. Such agreement shall include, without limitation, a representation that neither the execution nor delivery of such agreement nor fulfillment nor compliance with the terms and provisions thereof shall conflict with, or result in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any agreement or instrument to which the Subordinated Lender is subject and none of the Subordinated Debt will, at the time of incurrence thereof or at any time thereafter be subordinated to any Indebtedness of the Borrower other than Senior Debt.
11.       So long as any of the Senior Debt shall not have been paid in full, the [Company] [Guarantor] shall not, and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to, give and the holders of the Subordinated Debt shall not demand, accept or receive any security, direct or indirect, for any Subordinated Debt.
12.       None of the above paragraphs, nor any term thereof, may be changed or waived except with the prior written consent of the holders of all the Senior Debt at the time outstanding. No Subordinated Debt or any term thereof may be changed, waived or cancelled in any manner which would have any adverse effect upon the right of the holders of Senior Debt at the time outstanding.

Exhibit 10.2
THIS GUARANTY AND SURETYSHIP AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of the 23rd day of March, 2012, is made by the Guarantors identified as such on the signature page hereof (each, a "Guarantor" and, collectively, the "Guarantors"), to the lenders parties to the Credit Agreement (as defined below) from time to time (the "Lenders") and CITIZENS BANK OF PENNSYLVANIA, a banking association organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as agent for the Lenders (in such capacity, together with its successors in such capacity, the "Agent").
WHEREAS, the Guarantors, Black Box Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Borrower"), the Lenders and the Agent entered into that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of March 23, 2012 (as the same may be amended, restated, modified or supplemented from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"), pursuant to which the Lenders made a revolving credit facility available to Borrower; and
WHEREAS, the Guarantors will derive substantial direct and indirect benefit from the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement; and
WHEREAS, it is a condition precedent to the extension of credit under the Credit Agreement that the Guarantors execute and deliver this Agreement; and
WHEREAS, this Agreement, among other things, is made by the Guarantors to induce the Lenders to enter into the Loan Documents (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and to induce the Lenders to extend credit under the Credit Agreement.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged by each Guarantor, and intending to be legally bound, each Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:
1.1 .
Definitions
(a)        .  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given in the Credit Agreement. In addition to the other terms defined elsewhere in this Agreement, as used herein the following terms shall have the following meanings:
Certain Definitions
   "" shall mean all obligations from time to time of the Borrower to the Lenders under or in connection with any Loan Document, whether for principal, interest, fees, indemnities, expenses or otherwise, and all refinancings or refundings thereof, whether such obligations are direct or indirect, otherwise secured or unsecured, joint or several, absolute or contingent, due or to become due, whether for payment or performance, now existing or hereafter arising (specifically including but not
Guaranteed Obligations
limited to obligations arising or accruing after the commencement of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding with respect to the Borrower or any other Person, or which would have arisen or accrued but for the commencement of such proceeding, even if the claim for such obligation is not enforceable or allowable in such proceeding). Without limitation of the foregoing, such obligations include all obligations arising from any extensions of credit under or in connection with the Loan Documents from time to time, regardless of whether any such extensions of credit are in excess of the amount committed under or contemplated by the Loan Documents or are made in circumstances in which any condition to extension of credit is not satisfied. Without limitation of the foregoing, any of the Lenders (or any successive assignee or transferee) from time to time may assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of their rights or obligations under the Loan Documents in accordance with Section 10.14 of the Credit Agreement (including, without limitation, all or any portion of any commitment to extend credit), or any other Guaranteed Obligations, to any other Person, and such Guaranteed Obligations (including, without limitation, any Guaranteed Obligations resulting from extension of credit by such other Person under or in connection with the Loan Documents) shall be and remain Guaranteed Obligations entitled to the benefit of the Credit Agreement.
2.1 .  Each Guarantor hereby jointly and severally absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees and becomes surety for the full and punctual payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations as and when such payment or performance shall become due (at scheduled maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents. This Agreement is an agreement of suretyship as well as of guaranty, is a guarantee of payment and performance and not merely of collectibility, and is in no way conditioned upon any attempt to collect from or proceed against the Borrower or any other Person or any other event or circumstance. The obligations of the Guarantors under this Agreement are direct and primary obligations of each Guarantor and are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations, and a separate action or actions may be brought against any Guarantor regardless of whether action is brought against the Borrower or any other Person or whether the Borrower or any other Person is joined in any such action or actions.
Guaranty and Suretyship
2.2 .  Each Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid and performed strictly in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting the Guaranteed Obligations, any of the terms of the Loan Documents or the rights of the Agent or any Lender or any other Person with respect thereto. The obligations of the Guarantors under this Agreement shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, irrespective of any of the following:
Obligations Absolute
(a)        any lack of legality, validity, enforceability, allowability (in a bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, dissolution or similar proceeding, or otherwise), or any avoidance or subordination, in whole or in part, of any Loan Document or any of the Guaranteed Obligations;
 
(b)        any change in the amount, nature, time, place or manner of payment or performance of, or in any other term of, any of the Guaranteed Obligations (whether or not such change is contemplated by the Loan Documents as presently constituted, and specifically including any increase in the Guaranteed Obligations, whether resulting from the extension of additional credit to the Borrower or otherwise), any execution of any additional Loan Documents or any amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any Loan Document;
(c)        any taking, exchange, release, impairment or nonperfection of any collateral, or any taking, release, impairment or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guaranty or other direct or indirect security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations;
(d)        any manner of application of collateral or other direct or indirect security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or proceeds thereof, to any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any commercially reasonable manner of sale or other disposition of any collateral for any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other assets of the Borrower;
(e)        any permanent impairment by any Lender or any other Person of any recourse of the Guarantor against the Borrower or any other Person, or any other permanent impairment by any Lender or any other Person of the suretyship status of the Guarantor;
(f)        any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, dissolution or similar proceedings with respect to, or any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate structure or existence of, the Borrower, any Guarantor or any other Person; or
(g)        any failure of any Lender or any other Person to disclose to any Guarantor any information pertaining to the business, operations, condition (financial or other) or prospects of the Borrower or any other Person, or to give any other notice, disclosure or demand.
2.3 .  Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defense to or limitation on its obligations under this Agreement arising out of or based upon any matter referred to in Section 2.2 and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any requirement of promptness, diligence or notice of acceptance, any other notice, disclosure or demand with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations and this Agreement, any requirement of acceptance hereof, reliance hereon or knowledge hereof by the Agent or any Lender, and any requirement that the Agent or any Lender protect, secure, perfect or insure any lien or any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against the Borrower or any other Person or any collateral or other direct or indirect security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, each Guarantor's waiver under this Section 2.3 shall apply only to each Guarantor's obligations hereunder and shall not limit or waive any of such Guarantor's subrogation rights.
Waivers, etc
2.4 .  This Agreement shall continue to be effective, or be automatically reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is avoided, rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Agent or any Lender for any reason, all as though such payment had not been made.
Reinstatement
 
2.5 .  Without limiting the generality of any other provision of this Agreement, if any acceleration of the time for payment or performance of any Guaranteed Obligation, or any condition to any such acceleration, shall at any time be stayed, enjoined or prevented for any reason (including stay or injunction resulting from the pendency against the Borrower or any other Person of a bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, dissolution or similar proceeding), each Guarantor agrees that, for purposes of this Agreement and its obligations hereunder, at the option of the Agent such Guaranteed Obligation shall be deemed to have been accelerated and such condition to acceleration shall be deemed to have been met.
No Stay
2.6 .  All payments to be made by the Guarantors pursuant to this Agreement shall be made at the times and in the manner prescribed for payments in Articles II and III of the Credit Agreement, without setoff, counterclaim, withholding or other deduction of any nature. All payments made by the Guarantors pursuant to this Agreement may be applied to the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Agreement in such order as the Agent may elect.
Payments
2.7 .  Any rights which any Guarantor may have or acquire by way of subrogation, reimbursement, restitution, exoneration, contribution or indemnity, and any similar rights (whether arising by operation of law, by agreement or otherwise), against the Borrower arising from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of any of the obligations of any Guarantor under or in connection with this Agreement, shall be subordinate in right of payment to the Guaranteed Obligations, and the Guarantors shall not exercise any such rights until all Guaranteed Obligations and all other obligations under this Agreement have been paid in cash or such other manner as may be acceptable to the Agent and performed in full and all commitments to extend credit under, and all Letters of Credit issued under, the Loan Documents shall have terminated. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, any amount shall be received by any Guarantor on account of any such rights at any time prior to the time at which all Guaranteed Obligations and all other obligations under this Agreement shall have been paid in cash or such other manner as may be acceptable to the Agent and performed in full and all commitments to extend credit under, and all Letters of Credit issued under, the Loan Documents shall have terminated, such amount shall be held by such Guarantor in trust for the benefit of the Lenders, segregated from other funds held by such Guarantor, and shall be forthwith delivered to Agent for the benefit of the Lenders in the exact form received by such Guarantor (with any necessary endorsement), to be applied to the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as the Agent may elect, or to be held by the Agent as security for the Guaranteed Obligations and disposed of by the Agent in any lawful manner, all as the Agent may elect.
Subrogation. Etc
2.8 .  This Agreement is a continuing guaranty and shall continue in full force and effect until all Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Agreement have been paid in cash or such other manner as may be acceptable to the Agent and performed in full, and all commitments to extend credit under, and all Letters of Credit issued under, the Loan Documents have terminated, subject in any event to reinstatement in accordance with Section 2.4. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any right to terminate or revoke this Agreement.
Continuing Agreement
 
2.9 .  Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, to the extent that mandatory and nonwaivable provisions of applicable Law pertaining to fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance otherwise would render the full amount of the obligations of the Guarantors under this Agreement avoidable, invalid or unenforceable, the obligations of each Guarantor under this Agreement shall be limited to the maximum amount which does not result in such avoidability, invalidity or unenforceability. In any action, suit or proceeding pertaining to this Agreement, the burden of proof, by clear and convincing evidence, shall be on the Person claiming that this Section 2.9 applies to limit any obligation of any Guarantor under this Agreement, or claiming that any obligation of any Guarantor under this Agreement is avoidable, invalid or unenforceable, as to each element of such claim.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, May 10, 2012Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX), a leading communications system integrator dedicated to designing, sourcing, implementing and maintaining today's complex communications solutions, today reported results for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012 and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012.
Fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share was 64 on net income of $11.2 million or 4.4% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of 68 on net income of $12.3 million or 4.8% of revenues for the same quarter last year. Included in our results for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012 is a $2.1 million reduction in our provision (benefit) for income taxes primarily related to the settlement of a state audit for Fiscal 2005 through Fiscal 2011 that increased fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share by 12. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, third quarter of Fiscal 2012 diluted loss per share was $16.12 on net loss of $283.4 million or (102.7)% of revenues. Excluding provision (benefit) for income taxes and reconciling items (which are identified below) and utilizing an operational effective tax rate (as described below), operating earnings per share (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012 were 65 on operating net income (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) of $11.4 million or 4.4% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of 75 on operating net income of $13.5 million or 5.3% of revenues for the same quarter last year. Fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012 pre-tax reconciling items were $3.8 million compared to $2.0 million for the same quarter last year. See below for further discussion regarding Management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements and a detailed presentation of the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the periods presented above.
Fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012 total revenues were $256 million, relatively equivalent to $255 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, third quarter of Fiscal 2012 total revenues were $276 million.
Fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012 cash provided by operating activities was $22 million or 195% of net income, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $19 million or 153% of net income for the same quarter last year. Fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012 free cash flow (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) was $20 million compared to $22 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, third quarter of Fiscal 2012 cash provided by operating activities was $31 million or (11)% of net loss and free cash flow was $27 million. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012, Black Box invested $26 million in acquisition activity and $1 million to pay dividends.
Fiscal 2012 diluted loss per share was $13.98 on a net loss of $247.7 million or (22.8)% of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of $2.97 on net income of $52.9 million or 4.9% of revenues for the same period last year. Included in our results for Fiscal 2012 is a $3.7 million reduction in our provision (benefit) for income taxes of which $1.6 million (recorded during the second quarter) primarily related to the settlement of an Internal Revenue Service audit for Fiscal 2007 through Fiscal 2010 and $2.1 million (recorded during the fourth quarter) primarily related to the settlement of a state tax audit for Fiscal 2005 through Fiscal 2011 that increased Fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share by 21. As previously disclosed, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of Fiscal 2012 ($317.8 million, pre-tax and $296.0 million, after-tax). Excluding provision (benefit) for income taxes and reconciling items and utilizing an operational effective tax rate, operating earnings per share for Fiscal 2012 were $3.03 on operating net income of $54.0 million or 5.0% of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of $3.29 on operating net income of $58.5 million or 5.5% of revenues for the same period last year. Fiscal 2012 pre-tax reconciling items including the goodwill impairment charge were $330.2 million compared to $9.1 million for the same period last year.
 
Fiscal 2012 total revenues were $1,088 million, an increase of 2% from $1,068 million for the same period last year. Fiscal 2012 cash provided by operating activities was $66 million or (27)% of net loss, compared to $55 million or 104% of net income for the same period last year. Fiscal 2012 free cash flow was $56 million compared to $61 million for the same period last year. During Fiscal 2012, Black Box invested $41 million in acquisition activity, $15 million to repurchase its common stock and $5 million to pay dividends.
The Company's six-month order backlog was $199 million at March 31, 2012, compared to $223 million for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter-end comparison basis, the Company's six-month order backlog was $208 million at December 31, 2011.
For Fiscal 2013, the Company is targeting reported revenues of approximately $1.05 billion to $1.09 billion and corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of $2.70 to $3.10. Included in these projections is an effective tax rate of 38.0%. For the first quarter of Fiscal 2013, the Company is targeting reported revenues of approximately $250 million to $260 million and corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of 58 to 65. These targets exclude acquisition-related expense and the impact of changes in the fair market value of the Company's interest-rate swaps, and are before any new mergers and acquisition activity that has not been announced.
Commenting on the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012 results and the first quarter of Fiscal 2013 outlook, Terry Blakemore, President and Chief Executive Officer said, "As discussed last quarter, Black Box has experienced softening demand in our commercial markets along with the decreased spending from our federal clients. Throughout the fourth quarter, we continued to see delays in project awards which has resulted in unsatisfactory financial performance for the quarter."
"In the near term, we are committed to adjust our cost structure to align with our revenue outlook. In addition, we will continue to provide new technology offerings to our clients that leverage the strength of our existing platform."
"Our profitability and consistent positive cash flow continue to provide us with the flexibility to pursue growth initiatives and return value to our stockholders. With confidence in the future of the business, we announced today that our Board has increased our quarterly dividend by 14% to 8 per share and increased our stock buyback authorization by one million shares."

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
As a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures such as free cash flow, operating income before provision for income taxes ("EBIT"), operating net income, operating earnings per share ("EPS"), Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") (as adjusted), Adjusted EBITDA (as adjusted), adjusted operating income and same-office revenue comparisons to illustrate the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided explanations of the Company's management ("Management") regarding their use and the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures and these reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which are provided below.
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources and (d) to measure operational profitability. Management uses similar non-GAAP measures as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members. Moreover, the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, they do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash change in fair value of the Company's interest-rate swaps which will continue to impact the Company's earnings until the interest-rate swaps are settled, (iv) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash goodwill impairment and (v) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow
Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by (used for) operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
Net capital expenditures
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be taken into account along with cash provided by (used for) operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.
 
Foreign currency exchange impact on cash
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to U.S. dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive or negative impact of such adjustments as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in U.S. dollars.
Proceeds from stock option exercises
The Company believes that proceeds from stock option exercises should be added to cash provided by (used for) operating activities to more accurately reflect the actual cash available to the Company. The Company has demonstrated a recurring inflow of cash related to its stock-based compensation plans and, since this cash is immediately available to the Company, it directly impacts the availability of the Company's operating cash. The amount of proceeds from stock option exercises is dependent upon a number of variables, including the number and exercise price of outstanding options and the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the timing of stock option exercises is under the control of the individual option holder and is not in the control of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of any proceeds from stock option exercises.
A reconciliation of cash provided by (used for) operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
 
Operating net income and operating earnings per share
Management believes that operating net income, defined by the Company as net income (loss) plus provision (benefit) for income taxes and reconciling items less taxes, and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provide investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in a way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Beginning with this earnings release, operating net income and operating EPS exclude provision (benefit) for income taxes and the reconciling items identified below and utilize an operational effective tax rate (as described below), as Management believes that it provides a better operational view of the Company. Reconciling items include amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps and goodwill impairment, each of which are non-cash charges. Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below.
Amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
 
Change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps
To mitigate the risk of interest-rate fluctuations associated with the Company's variable rate debt, the Company enters into interest-rate swaps ("interest-rate swaps") that do not qualify as a cash flow hedge. Thus, the Company records the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps as an asset/liability within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with the offset to Interest expense (income) within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Management excludes this non-cash expense and the related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Goodwill impairment
The Company incurred a loss due to goodwill impairment in its North America and Europe reporting segments. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
A reconciliation of net income (loss) to operating net income is presented below:
 
 
 
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
Management believes that EBITDA (as adjusted), defined as Net income (loss) plus provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest, depreciation, amortization and goodwill impairment, is a widely-accepted measure of profitability that may be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Adjusted EBITDA (as adjusted), defined as EBITDA (as adjusted) plus stock-based compensation expense, may also be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Stock-based compensation is an integral part of ongoing operations since it is considered similar to other types of compensation to employees. However, Management believes that varying levels of stock-based compensation expense could result in misleading period-over-period comparisons and is providing an adjusted disclosure which excludes stock compensation expense.
A reconciliation of net income to EBITDA (as adjusted) and Adjusted EBITDA (as adjusted) is presented below:
 
Supplemental Information
The following supplemental information, including geographical segment results, service type results, same-office revenue comparisons and significant balance sheet ratios and other information is being provided for comparisons of reported results for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012, third quarter of Fiscal 2012, fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2012 and 2011. All dollar amounts are in thousands unless noted otherwise.
 
Geographical Segment Results
Management is presented with and reviews revenues, operating income (loss) and adjusted operating income by geographical segment. Adjusted operating income is defined by the Company as operating income (loss) plus reconciling items. Reconciling items include amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions and goodwill impairment. See above for additional details provided by Management regarding non-GAAP financial measures. Revenues, operating income (loss) and adjusted operating income for North America, Europe and All Other are presented below:
 
 
Service Type Results
Management is presented with and reviews revenues and gross profit for Data Infrastructure, Voice Communications and Technology Products which are presented below:

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(e) Each of the actions set forth in this Item 5.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K (this "Form 8-K") occurred on May 15, 2012.
The Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Black Box Corporation (the "Company") recommended that the Board approve, and the Board approved, an annual incentive bonus plan (the "FY13 Annual Incentive Plan") under the Black Box Corporation 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2008 Plan") for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013 ("Fiscal 2013"). The performance goals for the FY13 Annual Incentive Plan are, as defined below, "operating earnings per share," "adjusted operating margin percent," "adjusted EBITDA" and "DSOs." "Operating earnings per share" means "operating net income" divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted) with "operating net income" meaning net income plus "Reconciling Items" (as defined below); "adjusted operating margin percent" means operating income plus Reconciling Items divided by total revenues; "adjusted EBITDA" means EBITDA (defined as net income plus provision for income taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization) plus Reconciling Items; and "DSOs" is an internal management calculation based on the balances in net accounts receivable, costs in excess of billings and billings in excess of costs at the end of the measurement period. "Reconciling Items" means: (i) amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) asset write-up expense on acquisitions; (iv) expenses, settlements, judgments and fines associated with material litigation ($500,000 or greater per matter); (v) changes in fair value of any interest-rate swaps; (vi) certain pension plan funding expenses; (vii) the impact of any goodwill impairment; and (viii) the effect of changes in tax laws or accounting principles affecting reported results.
The performance goals for the FY13 Annual Incentive Plan will be equally weighted. Under the FY13 Annual Incentive Plan, the achievement of the performance goals at 85% of target (90% of target for the DSOs performance goal) will result in a payout of 50% of targeted annual bonus, the achievement of the performance goals at 100% of target will result in a payout of 100% of targeted annual bonus and the achievement of the performance goals at 115% of target (110% of target for the DSOs performance goal) will result in a payout of 150% of targeted annual bonus. The achievement of the performance goals at target levels between the levels of target performance stated above will result in payouts of targeted annual bonus amounts calculated on a straight-line basis. The Compensation Committee retained negative discretion to decrease the amount of any award earned under the FY13 Annual Incentive Plan.
Following Board review and approval, the Compensation Committee made targeted annual bonus awards under the FY13 Annual Incentive Plan to the Company's executive officers as follows: R. Terry Blakemore, President and CEO  100% of base salary or $600,000; Michael McAndrew, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer  100% of base salary or $350,000; and Kenneth P. Davis, Vice President  100% of base salary or $330,000. Key, non-executive officer employees are also participating in the FY13 Annual Incentive Plan generally on the same terms as the executive officers.
 
The Compensation Committee recommended that the Board approve, and the Board approved, a new Long-Term Incentive Program (the "FY13 LTIP") under the 2008 Plan for the three fiscal years ending March 31, 2015 (the "Performance Period"). The FY13 LTIP is comprised of a restricted stock unit grant payable in shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value $.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), representing 20% of the award, a stock option grant representing 30% of the award and performance share awards (the "Performance Awards") payable in shares of the Common Stock representing 50% of the award.
The restricted stock units and stock options granted pursuant to the FY13 LTIP will vest in equal increments over three years. The performance goal for 50% of the Performance Awards is the Company's performance of a cumulative adjusted EBITDA goal (the "EBITDA Goal") and the performance goal for the remaining Performance Awards is the Company's total shareholder return ("TSR") relative to a peer group of companies for the Performance Period. For purposes of determining the payout of the Performance Awards: (A) the achievement of 75% of the EBITDA Goal will result in a payout of 50% of the Performance Awards subject to the EBITDA Goal, the achievement of 100% of the EBITDA Goal will result in a payout of 100% of the Performance Awards subject to the EBITDA Goal and the achievement of 120% of the EBITDA Goal will result in a payout of 150% of the Performance Awards subject to the EBITDA Goal; and (B) the ranking of the Company's TSR in the 35th percentile of the peer group's TSR will result in a payout of 50% of the Performance Awards subject to TSR, the ranking of the Company's TSR in the 55th percentile of the peer group's TSR will result in a payout of 100% of the Performance Awards subject to TSR, the ranking of the Company's TSR in the 75th percentile of the peer group's TSR will result in a payout of 150% of the Performance Awards subject to TSR and the ranking of the Company's TSR in the 100th percentile of the peer group's TSR will result in a payout of 200% of the Performance Awards subject to TSR. In the event of a negative Company TSR, the payout will be capped at 100% of the Performance Awards subject to TSR.
Following Board review and approval, the Compensation Committee approved targeted amounts and awards under the FY13 LTIP to the Company's executive officers, although the number of shares of Common Stock for each award under the FY13 LTIP could not exceed 110% of the number of shares granted for such award under the Long-Term Incentive Program (the "FY12 LTIP") for the three fiscal years ending March 31, 2014 (rounded to the nearest ten shares). The following are the awards made to the Company's executive officers in accordance with the foregoing: Mr. Blakemore  a restricted stock unit award for 15,790 shares of the Common Stock, a stock option grant for 61,770 shares of the Common Stock and Performance Awards for 37,430 shares of the Common Stock with a grant day value of $1,742,351 (as compared to $2,324,000 under the FY12 LTIP); Mr. McAndrew  a restricted stock unit award for 7,900 shares of the Common Stock, a stock option grant for 30,890 shares of the Common Stock and Performance Awards for 18,710 shares of the Common Stock with a grant day value of $871,215 (as compared to $1,162,000 under the FY12 LTIP); and Mr. Davis  a restricted stock unit award for 5,430 shares of the Common Stock, a stock option grant for 21,260 shares of the Common Stock and Performance Awards for 12,880 shares of the Common Stock with a grant day value of $599,521 (as compared to $800,000 under the FY12 LTIP). Key, non-executive officer employees are also participating in the FY13 LTIP generally on the same relative basis as the executive officers.
 
The foregoing awards under the 2008 Plan were granted on May 15, 2012.
 
Each of the actions set forth in this Item 8.01 of this Form 8-K occurred on May 15, 2012.
The Board, upon the recommendation of the Governance Committee of the Board (the "Governance Committee"), made no changes in the compensation arrangements for the non-employee members of the Board. The following are such compensation arrangements effective for Fiscal 2013.
Each non-employee member of the Board will continue to receive an annual retainer of $35,000 per year, payable quarterly.
Meeting fees for Board and Board committee meetings will remain as follows: $2,000 for each Board meeting attended in person; $1,000 for each Board meeting attended by telephone; $1,500 for each meeting of the Audit Committee of the Board (the "Audit Committee") attended in person or by telephone; and $1,000 for each meeting of the Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee"), the Governance Committee and the Nominating Committee of the Board (the "Nominating Committee") attended in person or by telephone.
The Chairpersons of each of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee will continue to receive an annual retainer of $15,000, payable quarterly. The Chairperson of each of the Governance Committee and the Nominating Committee will receive an annual retainer of $7,500, payable quarterly.
The non-executive Chairperson of the Board will continue to receive an annual retainer of $75,000, payable quarterly.
In addition, on May 15, 2012, each non-employee director received an immediately-vested restricted stock unit award with a value of $100,000 on such date (which was the same amount for the previous two (2) fiscal years). Based on the closing price of the Common Stock on the date of grant (and rounding to the nearest ten shares), this grant resulted in a restricted stock unit award to each non-employee director for 4,530 shares of the Common Stock which vested immediately upon grant.
The Company maintains directors' and officers' liability insurance. Directors also are reimbursed customary expenses for attending meetings of the board of directors, board committees and stockholders.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

QUARTER OF FISCAL
2013

PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA,
July 31, 2012
- Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX), a leading communications system integrator dedicated to designing, sourcing, implementing and maintaining today's complex communications solutions, today reported results for the
first
quarter of Fiscal
2013
.
First
quarter of Fiscal
2013
diluted earnings per share was
34
 on net income of
$5.9 million
or
2.4%
of revenues compared to diluted earnings per share of
53
 on net income of
$9.6 million
or
3.6%
of revenues for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis,
fourth
quarter of Fiscal
2012
diluted earnings per share was
64
 on net income of
$11.2 million
or
4.4%
of revenues. Excluding provision for income taxes and reconciling items (which are identified below) and utilizing an operational effective tax rate (as described below), operating earnings per share (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) for the
first
quarter of Fiscal
2013
were
56
 on operating net income (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) of
$9.7 million
or
3.9%
of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of
60
 on operating net income of
$10.9 million
or
4.1%
of revenues for the same quarter last year. The Company's fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012 earnings release included first quarter of Fiscal 2013 guidance for Operating EPS in the range of 58 to 65, which range did not exclude restructuring estimated at that time to be $1.5 million. First quarter of Fiscal 2013 Operating EPS of 56 excludes restructuring of $2.0 million which represents a 7 after-tax benefit to Operating EPS. The Company's guidance throughout the remainder of Fiscal 2013 will exclude restructuring.
First
quarter of Fiscal
2013
pre-tax reconciling items were
$6.1 million
compared to
$2.1 million
for the same quarter last year. See below for further discussion regarding Management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements and a detailed presentation of the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the periods presented above.
First
quarter of Fiscal
2013
total revenues were
$248 million
, a decrease of
8%
from
$268 million
for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis,
fourth
quarter of Fiscal
2012
total revenues were
$256 million
.
First
quarter of Fiscal
2013
cash used for operating activities was
$3 million
or
(57)%
of net income, compared to cash provided by operating activities of
$14 million
or
141%
of net income for the same quarter last year.
First
quarter of Fiscal
2013
free cash flow (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) was
$(5) million
compared to
$12 million
for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis,
fourth
quarter of Fiscal
2012
cash provided by operating activities was
$22 million
or
195%
of net income and free cash flow was
$20 million
. During the
first
quarter of Fiscal
2013
, Black Box invested $17 million to repurchase common stock and $1 million to pay dividends.
Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company.
The Company's six-month order backlog was
$192 million
at
June 30, 2012
, compared to
$230 million
for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter-end comparison basis, the Company's six-month order backlog was
$199 million
at
March 31, 2012
.
For Fiscal
2013
, the Company is targeting reported revenues of approximately
$990
million to
$1.03
billion and corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of
$2.45
to
$2.85
. Included in these projections is an effective tax rate of
38.0%
. For the
second
quarter of Fiscal
2013
, the Company is targeting reported revenues of approximately
$247
million to
$257
million and corresponding operating earnings per share in the range of
68
 to
75
. These targets exclude acquisition-related expense, restructuring and the impact of changes in the fair market value of the Company's interest-rate swaps, and are before any new mergers and acquisition activity that has not been announced.

Exhibit 99.1
Commenting on the
first
quarter of Fiscal
2013
results, Terry Blakemore, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "In the first quarter of Fiscal 2013, our expected revenue and profitability levels were negatively impacted by delays in anticipated awards from our Federal clients.  In addition,
a
t a macro level, we continue to see weak IT spending and slower than expected economic growth, lengthening sales cycles and deferring project starts."
"However, I am confident that Black Box is well-positioned competitively, and know that our broad portfolio of products and world-class service capabilities will strengthen our results when client spend returns.  Until that time, we are focused on managing our flexible cost structure to ensure continued profitability and strong cash flow."

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
As a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures such as free cash flow, operating income before provision for income taxes ("EBIT"), operating net income, operating earnings per share (EPS), Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA), Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income and same-office revenue comparisons to illustrate the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided explanations of the Company's management ("Management") regarding their use and the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which are provided below.
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources and (d) to measure operational profitability. Management uses similar non-GAAP measures as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members. Moreover, the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, they do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash change in fair value of the Company's interest-rate swaps which will continue to impact the Company's earnings until the interest-rate swaps are settled, (iv) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude costs, primarily cash costs, for restructuring incurred during the periods reported in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services that will impact future operating results and (v) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow
Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by (used for) operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
Net capital expenditures
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be taken into account along with cash provided by (used for) operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.
Foreign currency exchange impact on cash
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to U.S. dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive or negative impact of such adjustments as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in U.S. dollars.
6
                                                
Proceeds from stock option exercises
The Company believes that proceeds from stock option exercises should be added to cash provided by (used for) operating activities to more accurately reflect the actual cash available to the Company. The Company has demonstrated a recurring inflow of cash related to its stock-based compensation plans and, since this cash is immediately available to the Company, it directly impacts the availability of the Company's operating cash. The amount of proceeds from stock option exercises is dependent upon a number of variables, including the number and exercise price of outstanding options and the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the timing of stock option exercises is under the control of the individual option holder and is not in the control of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of any proceeds from stock option exercises.
A reconciliation of cash provided by (used for) operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
Operating net income and operating earnings per share
Management believes that operating net income, defined by the Company as net income plus provision for income taxes and reconciling items less operational income taxes, and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provide investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in a way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Reconciling items include amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions and the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps, each of which are non-cash charges, and restructuring, which is a cash charge. Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below.
Amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an
acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps
To mitigate the risk of interest-rate fluctuations associated with the Company's variable rate debt, the Company enters into interest-rate swaps (interest-rate swaps) that do not qualify as a cash flow hedge. Thus, the Company records the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps as an asset/liability within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with the offset to Interest expense (income) within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Management excludes this non-cash expense and the related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Restructuring
The Company believes that incurring costs for employee severance and facility consolidations in the current period(s) in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services will result in a long-term positive impact on financial performance in the future. Restructuring costs are presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. However, due to the amount of additional costs incurred during a single or possibly successive periods, Management believes that exclusion of these costs and their related tax impact provides a more accurate reflection of the Company's ongoing financial performance.
7
                                                
A reconciliation of net income to operating net income is presented below:
1
During 1Q12, the effective tax rate utilized to determine Operational income taxes was the effective tax rate utilized to determine Net income. In 4Q12 and 1Q13, the effective tax rate utilized to determine Operational income taxes was the Company's operational effective tax rate that excludes discreet tax items.
A reconciliation of Diluted EPS to Operating EPS is presented below:
1
EPS impact is the result of excluding the provision for income taxes and the reconciling items and utilizing an operational effective tax rate.
2
The Company's fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012 earnings release included first quarter of Fiscal 2013 guidance for Operating EPS in the range of 58 to 65, which range did not exclude restructuring estimated at that time to be $1.5 million. First quarter of Fiscal 2013 Operating EPS of 56 excludes restructuring of $2.0 million which represents a 7 after-tax benefit to Operating EPS.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
Management believes that EBITDA, defined as Net income plus provision for income taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization, is a widely-accepted measure of profitability that may be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Adjusted EBITDA, defined as EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense, may also be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Stock-based compensation is an integral part of ongoing operations since it is considered similar to other types of compensation to employees. However, Management believes that varying levels of stock-based compensation expense could result in misleading period-over-period comparisons and is providing an adjusted disclosure which excludes stock compensation expense.
A reconciliation of Net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is presented below:

first
quarter of Fiscal
2013
diluted earnings per share was
34
 on net income of
$5.9 million
or
2.4%
of revenues. Excluding provision for income taxes and reconciling items (which are identified below) and utilizing an operational effective tax rate (as described below), operating earnings per share (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) for the
second
quarter of Fiscal
2013
was
65
 on operating net income (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) of
$10.9 million
or
4.2%
of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of
93
 on operating net income of
$16.6 million
or
5.8%
of revenues for the same quarter last year.
Second
quarter of Fiscal
2013
pre-tax reconciling items were
$6.1 million
compared to
$2.6 million
for the same quarter last year. See below for further discussion regarding Management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements and a detailed presentation of the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the periods presented above.
Second
quarter of Fiscal
2013
total revenues were
$260 million
, a decrease of
9%
from
$287 million
for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis,

quarter of Fiscal
2013
total revenues were
$248 million
.
Second
quarter of Fiscal
2013
cash provided by operating activities was

on net income of
$13.1 million

Exhibit 99.1
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
As a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures such as free cash flow, operating income before provision for income taxes ("EBIT"), operating net income, operating earnings per share (EPS), Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA), Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income and same-office revenue comparisons to illustrate the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided explanations regarding use by the Company's management ("Management") and the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which are provided below.
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources and (d) to measure operational profitability. Management uses similar non-GAAP measures as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members. Moreover, the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, they do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash change in fair value of the Company's interest-rate swaps which will continue to impact the Company's earnings until the interest-rate swaps are settled, (iv) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude costs, primarily cash costs, for restructuring incurred during the periods reported in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services that will impact future operating results and (v) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow
Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by (used for) operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
Net capital expenditures
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be taken into account along with cash provided by (used for) operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.
Foreign currency exchange impact on cash
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to U.S. dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive or negative impact of such adjustments as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in U.S. dollars.
6
Exhibit 99.1
Proceeds from stock option exercises
The Company believes that proceeds from stock option exercises should be added to cash provided by (used for) operating activities to more accurately reflect the actual cash available to the Company. The Company has demonstrated a recurring inflow of cash related to its stock-based compensation plans and, since this cash is immediately available to the Company, it directly impacts the availability of the Company's operating cash. The amount of proceeds from stock option exercises is dependent upon a number of variables, including the number and exercise price of outstanding options and the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the timing of stock option exercises is under the control of the individual option holder and is not under the control of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of any proceeds from stock option exercises.
A reconciliation of cash provided by (used for) operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
Operating net income and operating earnings per share
Management believes that operating net income, defined by the Company as net income plus provision for income taxes and reconciling items less operational income taxes, and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provide investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in a way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Reconciling items include amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions and the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps, each of which are non-cash charges, and restructuring, which is a cash charge. Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below.
Amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an
acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps
To mitigate the risk of interest-rate fluctuations associated with the Company's variable rate debt, the Company enters into interest-rate swaps (interest-rate swaps) that do not qualify as a cash flow hedge. Thus, the Company records the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps as an asset/liability within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with the offset to Interest expense (income) within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Management excludes this non-cash expense and the related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Restructuring
The Company believes that incurring costs for employee severance and facility consolidations in the current period(s) in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services will result in a long-term positive impact on financial performance in the future. Restructuring costs are presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. However, due to the amount of additional costs incurred during a single or possibly successive periods, Management believes that exclusion of these costs and their related tax impact provides a more accurate reflection of the Company's ongoing financial performance.

Exhibit 99.1
A reconciliation of net income to operating net income is presented below:
1
For 2Q12 and 2QYTD12, the effective tax rate utilized to determine Operational income taxes was the effective tax rate utilized to determine Net income. For 2Q13, 1Q13 and 2QYTD13, the effective tax rate utilized to determine Operational income taxes was the Company's operational effective tax rate that excludes discreet tax items.
A reconciliation of Diluted EPS to Operating EPS is presented below:
1
EPS impact is the result of excluding the provision for income taxes and the reconciling items and utilizing an operational effective tax rate.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
Management believes that EBITDA, defined as Net income plus provision for income taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization, is a widely-accepted measure of profitability that may be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Adjusted EBITDA, defined as EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense, may also be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Stock-based compensation is an integral part of ongoing operations since it is considered similar to other types of compensation to employees. However, Management believes that varying levels of stock-based compensation expense could result in misleading period-over-period comparisons and is providing an adjusted disclosure which excludes stock-based compensation expense.
A reconciliation of Net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is presented below:

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BLACK BOX CORPORATION REPORTS
THIRD
QUARTER OF FISCAL
2013
RESULTS
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA,
January 29, 2013
- Black Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX), a leading communications system integrator dedicated to designing, sourcing, implementing and maintaining today's complex communications solutions, today reported results for the
third
quarter of Fiscal
2013
.
Third
quarter of Fiscal
2013
diluted earnings per share was
52
 on net income of
$8.5 million
or
3.4%
of revenues compared to diluted loss per share of
$16.12
on net loss of
$283.4 million
or
(102.7)%
of revenues for the same quarter last year. Included in our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of Fiscal 2013 and the third quarter of Fiscal 2012 was a loss ($2.7 million, pre-tax and $1.7 million, after-tax) resulting from the expected divestiture of our non-controlling interest in Genesis Networks Integration Services, LLC and the previously disclosed goodwill impairment charge ($317.8 million, pre-tax and $296.0 million, after-tax), respectively. On a sequential quarter comparison basis,
second
quarter of Fiscal
2013
diluted earnings per share was
43
 on net income of
$7.1 million
or
2.7%
of revenues. Excluding provision (benefit) for income taxes and reconciling items (which are identified below) and utilizing an operational effective tax rate (as described below), operating earnings per share (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) for the
third
quarter of Fiscal
2013
was
79
 on operating net income (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) of
$13.0 million
or
5.2%
of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of
85
 on operating net income of
$15.0 million
or
5.4%
of revenues for the same quarter last year.
Third
quarter of Fiscal
2013
pre-tax reconciling items, including the divestiture charge noted above, were
$7.3 million
compared to
$321.8 million
, which included the goodwill impairment loss, for the same quarter last year. See below for further discussion regarding Management's use of non-GAAP accounting measurements and a detailed presentation of the Company's pre-tax reconciling items for the periods presented above.
Third
quarter of Fiscal
2013
total revenues were
$252 million
, a decrease of
9%
from
$276 million
for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis,
second
quarter of Fiscal
2013
total revenues were
$260 million
.
Third
quarter of Fiscal
2013
cash provided by operating activities was
$16 million
or
191%
of net income, compared to cash provided by operating activities of
$30.6 million
or
(11)%
of net loss for the same quarter last year.
Third
quarter of Fiscal
2013
free cash flow (which is a non-GAAP term and is defined below) was
$15 million
compared to
$27 million
for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter comparison basis,
second
quarter of Fiscal
2013
cash provided by operating activities was
$18 million
or
250%
of net income and free cash flow was
$17 million
. During the
third
quarter of Fiscal
2013
, Black Box invested $6 million to repurchase common stock and $1 million to pay dividends.
Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by (used for) operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company.
For the
nine
months ended
December 29, 2012
, diluted earnings per share was
$1.28
on net income of
$21.6 million
or
2.8%
of revenues compared to diluted loss per share of
$14.54
on net loss of
$259.0 million
or
(31.1)%
of revenues for the same period last year. Excluding provision (benefit) for income taxes and reconciling items and utilizing an operational effective tax rate, operating earnings per share for the
nine
months ended
December 29, 2012
was
$1.99
on operating net income of
$33.6 million
or
4.4%
of revenues compared to operating earnings per share of
$2.38
on operating net income of
$42.6 million
or
5.1%
of revenues for the same period last year. Pre-tax reconciling items for the
nine
months ended
December 29, 2012
were
$19.4 million
compared to
$326.4 million
for the same period last year.

Exhibit 99.1
For the
nine
months ended
December 29, 2012
, total revenues were
$760 million
, a decrease of
9%
from
$832 million
for the same period last year.
For the
nine
months ended
December 29, 2012
, cash provided by operating activities was
$31 million
or
142%
of net income, compared to cash provided by operating activities of
$44 million
or
(17)%
of net income for the same period last year. Free cash flow for the
nine
months ended
December 29, 2012
was
$27 million
compared to

for the same period last year. For the
nine
months ended
December 29, 2012
, Black Box invested $33 million to repurchase common stock and $4 million to pay dividends.
The Company's six-month order backlog was
$188 million
at
December 29, 2012
, compared to
$208 million
for the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter-end comparison basis, the Company's six-month order backlog was
$203 million
at
September 29, 2012
.
For Fiscal
2013
, the Company is targeting reported revenues of approximately
$990 million

Exhibit 99.1
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
As a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures such as free cash flow, operating income before provision for income taxes ("EBIT"), operating net income, operating earnings per share ("EPS"), Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") (as adjusted), Adjusted EBITDA (as adjusted), adjusted operating income and same-office revenue comparisons to illustrate the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided explanations regarding use by the Company's management ("Management") and the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which are provided below.
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources and (d) to measure operational profitability. Management uses similar non-GAAP measures as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members. Moreover, the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, they do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash change in fair value of the Company's interest-rate swaps which will continue to impact the Company's earnings until the interest-rate swaps are settled, (iv) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash goodwill impairment loss, (v) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude costs, primarily cash costs, for restructuring incurred during the periods reported in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services that will impact future operating results, (vi) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash joint venture investment loss and (vii) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow
Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by (used for) operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
Net capital expenditures
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be taken into account along with cash provided by (used for) operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.
Foreign currency exchange impact on cash
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to U.S. dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive or negative impact of such adjustments as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in U.S. dollars.
7
Exhibit 99.1
Proceeds from stock option exercises
The Company believes that proceeds from stock option exercises should be added to cash provided by (used for) operating activities to more accurately reflect the actual cash available to the Company. The Company historically has demonstrated a recurring inflow of cash related to its stock-based compensation plans and, since this cash is immediately available to the Company, it directly impacts the availability of the Company's operating cash. The amount of proceeds from stock option exercises is dependent upon a number of variables, including the number and exercise price of outstanding options and the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the timing of stock option exercises is under the control of the individual option holder and is not under the control of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of any proceeds from stock option exercises.
A reconciliation of cash provided by (used for) operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
Operating net income and operating earnings per share
Management believes that operating net income, defined by the Company as net income (loss) plus provision (benefit) for income taxes and reconciling items less operational income taxes, and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provide investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in the way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Reconciling items include amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps, the goodwill impairment loss and the joint venture investment loss, each of which are non-cash charges, and restructuring, which is a cash charge. Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below.
Amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an
acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps
To mitigate the risk of interest-rate fluctuations associated with the Company's variable rate debt, the Company enters into interest-rate swaps (interest-rate swaps) that do not qualify as a cash flow hedge. Thus, the Company records the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps as an asset/liability within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with the offset to Interest expense (income) within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Management excludes this non-cash expense and the related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Goodwill impairment
The Company incurred a loss during the third quarter of Fiscal 2012 due to goodwill impairment in its North America and Europe reporting segments. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
8
Exhibit 99.1
Restructuring
The Company believes that incurring costs for employee severance and facility consolidations in the current period(s) in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services will result in a long-term positive impact on financial performance in the future. Restructuring costs are presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. However, due to the amount of additional costs incurred during a single or possibly successive periods, Management believes that exclusion of these costs and their related tax impact provides a more accurate reflection of the Company's ongoing financial performance.
Joint venture investment loss
The Company incurred a loss during the third quarter of Fiscal 2013 due to the expected divestiture of our non-controlling interest in Genesis Networks Integration Services, LLC, a minority business enterprise joint venture company which was formed in conjunction with Genesis Networks Enterprises, LLC. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
A reconciliation of net income (loss) to operating net income is presented below:
* The effective tax rate utilized to determine Operational income taxes was the Company's operational effective tax rate that excludes discreet tax items.
A reconciliation of Diluted EPS to Operating EPS is presented below:
* EPS impact is the result of excluding the provision (benefit) for income taxes and the reconciling items and utilizing an operational effective tax rate.
9
Exhibit 99.1
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
Management believes that EBITDA (as adjusted), defined as Net income (loss) plus provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest, depreciation, amortization, the goodwill impairment loss and the joint venture investment loss, is a widely-accepted measure of profitability that may be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Adjusted EBITDA (as adjusted), defined as EBITDA plus stock compensation expense, may also be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Stock compensation is an integral part of ongoing operations since it is considered similar to other types of compensation to employees. However, Management believes that varying levels of stock compensation expense could result in misleading period-over-period comparisons and is providing an adjusted disclosure which excludes stock compensation expense.
A reconciliation of Net income (loss) to EBITDA (as adjusted) and Adjusted EBITDA (as adjusted) is presented below:

Mr. Heller retired from Caterpillar Inc. (manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives) in February 2012.

He is a graduate of Millikin University with a bachelor's degree in Business Administration and holds an M.B.A. from the University of Illinois.
Mr. Trammell is a Managing Partner of Lone Rock Technology Group (private equity) since 2011. Mr. Trammell was a founder and the CEO of CacheIQ, Inc.

(network management software and services) from June 2000 to November 2009. Mr. Trammell is a graduate of Louisiana Tech University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering.
Messrs. Heller and Trammell will receive compensation payable to non-employee directors as summarized in Exhibit 10.21 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012.
New CEO Agreement
As previously disclosed, Michael McAndrew became the Company's Chief Executive Officer and joined the Board as a director effective April 1, 2013, succeeding Terry Blakemore who will remain on the Board until the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders.
In connection therewith, on March 27, 2013, the Compensation Committee of the Board recommended that the Board approve, and the Board approved, a new agreement for Mr. McAndrew that supersedes, effective April 1, 2013, his previous agreement dated December 26, 2008.
The new agreement provides for severance payments to Mr. McAndrew upon termination of employment by the Company (other than due to death, disability, retirement or for cause) or by Mr. McAndrew for good reason (
i.e.
, a material diminution in base compensation, authority, duties or responsibilities) prior to a change-in-control of the Company. The severance owed in this case is a lump sum payment of not less than twelve (12) months' base salary and not more than the amount of base salary remaining to be paid to Mr. McAndrew to the third anniversary of the date of the agreement.
This agreement also provides for severance payments to Mr. McAndrew upon termination of employment by the Company (other than due to death, disability, retirement or for cause) or by Mr. McAndrew for good reason (
i.e.
, a material diminution in base compensation, authority, duties or responsibilities or a relocation), in each case within two (2) years following a change-in-control of the Company. The amount of severance obligation owed in this case generally is an amount equal to three (3) times Mr. McAndrew's annual base salary and average incentive bonus received over the preceding three (3) years plus the amount that would be paid under any existing long-term incentive plan. In addition, if severance is owed under the scenario described in this paragraph, (i) all stock options held by the executive which did not immediately vest and/or become exercisable upon the occurrence of a change-in-control will vest and remain outstanding for their stated term, not to exceed ten (10) years and (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable law and the medical insurance and benefits policies to which Mr. McAndrew is entitled to participate, the Company will maintain Mr. McAndrew's paid coverage for health insurance (through the payment of Mr. McAndrew's insurance premiums) generally for eighteen (18) months. Such payments are not required to be grossed up for the effect of any excise taxes that might be due under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.
2
The agreement also contains provisions relating to non-disclosure of the Company's proprietary information, assignment of intellectual property rights to the Company and non-competition with the Company for a period of five (5) years following termination of employment with the Company. The term of the agreement is five (5) years with an evergreen renewal on a one-year basis thereafter, absent notice of non-renewal six (6) months prior to the renewal date. The foregoing summary of the new agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the agreement with Mr. McAndrew attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference thereto.

Exhibit 99.1
    
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
As a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures such as free cash flow, operating income before provision for income taxes ("EBIT"), operating net income, operating earnings per share ("EPS"), Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") (as adjusted), Adjusted EBITDA (as adjusted), adjusted operating income and same-office revenue comparisons to illustrate the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided explanations regarding use by the Company's management ("Management") and the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which are provided below.
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources and (d) to measure operational profitability. Management uses similar non-GAAP measures as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members. Moreover, the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The limitations include (i) the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation, (ii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain non-cash amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, however, they do not specifically exclude the added benefits of these costs, such as revenue and contributing operating margin, (iii) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash change in fair value of the Company's interest-rate swaps which will continue to impact the Company's earnings until the interest-rate swaps are settled, (iv) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash goodwill impairment loss, (v) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude costs, primarily cash costs, for restructuring incurred during the periods reported in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services that will impact future operating results, (vi) the non-GAAP financial measures exclude the non-cash joint venture investment loss and (vii) there is no assurance the excluded items in the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measurements, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow
Management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash provided by (used for) operating activities less net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from stock option exercises, plus or minus foreign currency translation adjustments, is an important measurement of liquidity as it represents the total cash available to the Company. Management's reasons for exclusion of each item are explained in further detail below.
Net capital expenditures
The Company believes net capital expenditures must be taken into account along with cash provided by (used for) operating activities to more properly reflect the actual cash available to the Company. Net capital expenditures directly impact the availability of the Company's operating cash. Net capital expenditures are comprised of capital expenditures and capital disposals.
Foreign currency exchange impact on cash
Due to the size of the Company's international operations, and the ability of the Company to utilize cash generated from foreign operations locally without the need to convert such currencies to U.S. dollars on a regular basis, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust its operating cash flows to take into account the positive or negative impact of such adjustments as such adjustment provides an appropriate measure of the availability of the Company's operating cash on a world-wide basis. A limitation of adjusting cash flows to account for the foreign currency impact is that it may not provide an accurate measure of cash available in U.S. dollars.
6
Exhibit 99.1
    
Proceeds from stock option exercises
The Company believes that proceeds from stock option exercises should be added to cash provided by (used for) operating activities to more accurately reflect the actual cash available to the Company. The Company historically has demonstrated a recurring inflow of cash related to its stock-based compensation plans and, since this cash is immediately available to the Company, it directly impacts the availability of the Company's operating cash. The amount of proceeds from stock option exercises is dependent upon a number of variables, including the number and exercise price of outstanding options and the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the timing of stock option exercises is under the control of the individual option holder and is not under the control of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of any proceeds from stock option exercises.
A reconciliation of cash provided by (used for) operating activities to free cash flow is presented below:
Operating net income and operating earnings per share
Management believes that operating net income, defined by the Company as net income (loss) plus provision (benefit) for income taxes and reconciling items less operational income taxes, and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provide investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in the way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Reconciling items include amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions, the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps, the goodwill impairment loss and the joint venture investment loss, each of which are non-cash charges, and restructuring, which is a cash charge. Management's reason for exclusion of each item is explained in further detail below.
Amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions
The Company incurs non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an
acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management after the acquisition.
Change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps
To mitigate the risk of interest-rate fluctuations associated with the Company's variable rate debt, the Company enters into interest-rate swaps (interest-rate swaps) that do not qualify as a cash flow hedge. Thus, the Company records the change in fair value of the interest-rate swaps as an asset/liability within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with the offset to Interest expense (income) within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Management excludes this non-cash expense and the related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs generally cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
Goodwill impairment
The Company incurred a loss during the third quarter of Fiscal 2012 due to goodwill impairment in its North America and Europe reporting segments. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.

Exhibit 99.1
    
Restructuring
The Company believes that incurring costs for employee severance and facility consolidations in the current period(s) in an attempt to right-size the organization and more appropriately align the expense structure with anticipated revenues and changing market demand for its solutions and services will result in a long-term positive impact on financial performance in the future. Restructuring costs are presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. However, due to the amount of additional costs incurred during a single or possibly successive periods, Management believes that exclusion of these costs and their related tax impact provides a more accurate reflection of the Company's ongoing financial performance.
Joint venture investment loss
The Company incurred a loss during the third quarter of Fiscal 2013 due to the expected divestiture of our non-controlling interest in Genesis Networks Integration Services, LLC, a minority business enterprise joint venture company which was formed in conjunction with Genesis Networks Enterprises, LLC. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP financial measures when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are generally non-recurring and cannot be changed or influenced by Management.
A reconciliation of net income (loss) to operating net income is presented below:
* The effective tax rate utilized to determine Operational income taxes was the Company's operational effective tax rate that excludes discreet tax items.
A reconciliation of Diluted EPS to Operating EPS is presented below:
* EPS impact is the result of excluding the provision (benefit) for income taxes and the reconciling items and utilizing an operational effective tax rate.

Exhibit 99.1
    
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
Management believes that EBITDA (as adjusted), defined as Net income (loss) plus provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest, depreciation, amortization, the goodwill impairment loss and the joint venture investment loss, is a widely-accepted measure of profitability that may be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Adjusted EBITDA (as adjusted), defined as EBITDA plus stock compensation expense, may also be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Stock compensation is an integral part of ongoing operations since it is considered similar to other types of compensation to employees. However, Management believes that varying levels of stock compensation expense could result in misleading period-over-period comparisons and is providing an adjusted disclosure which excludes stock compensation expense.
A reconciliation of Net income (loss) to EBITDA (as adjusted) and Adjusted EBITDA (as adjusted) is presented below:

(e) Each of the actions set forth in this Item 5.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K (this Form 8-K) occurred on May 14, 2013 unless otherwise noted.
The Compensation Committee (the Compensation Committee) of the Board of Directors (the Board) of Black Box Corporation (the Company) recommended (on May 13, 2013) that the Board approve, and the Board approved, an annual incentive bonus plan (the FY14 Annual Incentive Plan) under the Black Box Corporation 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2008 Plan) for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2014 (Fiscal 2014). The performance goals for the FY14 Annual Incentive Plan are, as defined below, operating earnings per share, adjusted operating margin percent, adjusted EBITDA and DSOs. Operating earnings per share means operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted) with operating net income meaning net income plus Reconciling Items (as defined below); adjusted operating margin percent means operating income plus Reconciling Items divided by total revenues; adjusted EBITDA means EBITDA (defined as net income plus provision for income taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization) plus Reconciling Items; and DSOs is an internal management calculation based on the balances in net accounts receivable, costs in excess of billings and billings in excess of costs at the end of the measurement period. Reconciling Items means: (i) amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions; (ii) asset write-up expense on acquisitions; (iii) expenses, settlements, judgments and fines associated with material litigation ($500,000 or greater per matter); (iv) changes in fair value of any interest-rate swaps; (v) the impact of any goodwill impairment; (vi) the effect of changes in tax laws or accounting principles affecting reported results; and (vii) restructuring expense in excess of $3 million in any fiscal year.
The performance goals for the FY14 Annual Incentive Plan will be equally weighted. Under the FY14 Annual Incentive Plan, the achievement of the performance goals at 85% of target (90% of target for the DSOs performance goal) will result in a payout of 50% of targeted annual bonus, the achievement of the performance goals at 100% of target will result in a payout of 100% of targeted annual bonus and the achievement of the performance goals at 115% of target (110% of target for the DSOs performance goal) will result in a payout of 150% of targeted annual bonus. The achievement of the performance goals at target levels between the levels of target performance stated above will result in payouts of targeted annual bonus amounts calculated on a straight-line basis. The Compensation Committee retained negative discretion to decrease the amount of any award earned under the FY14 Annual Incentive Plan.
Subject to Board review and approval, the Compensation Committee made targeted annual bonus awards under the FY14 Annual Incentive Plan to the Company's executive officers as follows: Michael McAndrew, President and CEO - 100% of base salary or $550,000; Kenneth P. Davis, Executive Vice President - 100% of base salary or $400,000; Timothy C. Huffmyer, Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer - 70% of base salary or $210,000; and Ronald Basso, Executive Vice President -80% of base salary or $280,000. Key, non-executive officer employees are also participating in the FY14 Annual Incentive Plan generally on the same terms as the executive officers.
The Compensation Committee recommended (on May 13, 2013) that the Board approve, and the Board approved, a new Long-Term Incentive Program (the FY14 LTIP) under the 2008 Plan for the three fiscal years ending March 31, 2016 (the Performance Period). The FY14 LTIP is comprised of a restricted stock unit grant payable in shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value $.001 per share (the Common Stock), representing 20% of the award, a stock option grant representing 30% of the award and performance share awards (the Performance Awards) payable in shares of the Common Stock representing 50% of the award.
The restricted stock units and stock options granted pursuant to the FY14 LTIP will vest in equal increments over three years. The performance goal for 50% of the Performance Awards is the Company's performance of a cumulative adjusted EBITDA goal (the EBITDA Goal) and the performance goal for the remaining Performance Awards is the Company's total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a peer group of companies for the Performance Period. For purposes of determining the payout of the Performance Awards: (A) the achievement of 75% of the EBITDA Goal will result in a payout of 50% of the Performance Awards subject to the EBITDA Goal, the achievement of 100% of the EBITDA Goal will result in a payout of 100% of the Performance Awards subject to the EBITDA Goal and the achievement of 120% of the EBITDA Goal will result in a payout of 150% of the Performance Awards subject to the EBITDA Goal; and (B) the ranking of the Company's TSR in the 35th percentile of the peer group's TSR will result in a payout of 50% of the Performance Awards subject to TSR, the ranking of the Company's TSR in the 55th percentile of the peer group's TSR will result in a payout of 100% of the Performance Awards subject to TSR, the ranking of the Company's TSR in the 75th percentile of the peer group's TSR will result in a payout of 150% of the Performance Awards subject to TSR and the ranking of the Company's TSR in the 100th percentile of the peer group's TSR will result in a payout of 200% of the Performance Awards subject to TSR. In the event of a negative Company TSR, the payout will be capped at 100% of the Performance Awards subject to TSR.

Subject to Board review and approval, the Compensation Committee approved the following targeted amounts and awards under the FY14 LTIP to the Company's executive officers: Mr. McAndrew - a restricted stock unit award for 11,800 shares of the Common Stock, a stock option grant for 46,070 shares of the Common Stock and Performance Awards for 26,720 shares of the Common Stock with a grant date value of approximately $1,545,000; Mr. Davis - a restricted stock unit award for 6,110 shares of the Common Stock, a stock option grant for 23,860 shares of the Common Stock and Performance Awards for 13,840 shares of the Common Stock with a grant date value of approximately $800,000; Mr. Huffmyer - a restricted stock unit award for 3,440 shares of the Common Stock, a stock option grant for 13,420 shares of the Common Stock and Performance Awards for 7,790 shares of the Common Stock with a grant date value of approximately $450,000; and Mr. Basso- a restricted stock unit award for 5,730 shares of the Common Stock, a stock option grant for 22,370 shares of the Common Stock and Performance Awards for 12,970 shares of the Common Stock with a grant date value of approximately $750,000. Key, non-executive officer employees are also participating in the FY14 LTIP generally on the same relative basis as the executive officers.
The foregoing awards under the 2008 Plan were granted on May 14, 2013.
Each of the actions set forth in this Item 8.01 of this Form 8-K occurred on May 14, 2013 unless otherwise noted.
The Board, upon the recommendation of the Governance Committee of the Board (the Governance Committee) on May 13, 2013, made no changes in the compensation arrangements for the non-employee members of the Board. The following are such compensation arrangements effective for Fiscal 2014.
Each non-employee member of the Board will continue to receive an annual retainer of $35,000 per year, payable quarterly.
Meeting fees for Board and Board committee meetings will remain as follows: $2,000 for each Board meeting attended in person; $1,000 for each Board meeting attended by telephone; $1,500 for each meeting of the Audit Committee of the Board (the Audit Committee) attended in person or by telephone; and $1,000 for each meeting of the Compensation Committee of the Board (the Compensation Committee), the Governance Committee and the Nominating Committee of the Board (the Nominating Committee) attended in person or by telephone.
The Chairpersons of each of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee will continue to receive an annual retainer of $15,000, payable quarterly. The Chairperson of each of the Governance Committee and the Nominating Committee will receive an annual retainer of $7,500, payable quarterly.
The non-executive Chairperson of the Board will continue to receive an annual retainer of $75,000, payable quarterly.
In addition, on May 14, 2013, each non-employee director received an immediately-vested restricted stock unit award with a value of $100,000 ($50,000 for Messrs. John S. Heller and Joel T. Trammell who recently joined the Board) on such date (which was the same amount for the previous three (3) fiscal years). Based on the closing price of the Common Stock on the date of grant (and rounding to the nearest ten shares), this grant resulted in a restricted stock unit award to each non-employee director for 3,820 shares (1,910 for Messrs. Heller and Trammell) of the Common Stock which vested immediately upon grant.
The Company maintains directors' and officers' liability insurance. Directors also are reimbursed customary expenses for attending meetings of the board of directors, board committees and stockholders.
