EXHIBIT 99.5
 
 
 
For the fiscal yearRevenues Increase 20%; Net income up 10%; Earnings per share increase 9%
 
 
AZZ incorporated (NYSE:AZZ), a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services, today announced unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 28, 2003. Revenues for the fourth quarter decreased 21 percent to $39.8 million compared to $50.5 million for the same quarter last year. Net income for the quarter was $1.4 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.8 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, in last year's fiscal fourth quarter.
April 3, 2003
FORT WORTH, TX
 
For the year, the Company reported unaudited revenues of $183.4 million compared to fiscal year 2002 revenues of $152.9 million; an increase of 20 percent. Net income for the year was $8.6 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, compared to net income of $7.8 million, or $1.50 per diluted share, last year. Guidance, which had previously been issued for fiscal 2003, was for earnings per diluted share of $1.60 to $1.70 and revenues of $180 to $190 million. Backlog at year-end was $49.1 million compared to $85.3 million at the end of fiscal 2002. Beginning March 1, 2002 in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 142, the Company no longer amortizes goodwill, which favorably impacted results for the three and twelve-month periods by approximately $ 0.05 and $0.18 per diluted shares, respectively.
 
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of AZZ incorporated, commented, "Fiscal 2003 was a year in which AZZ experienced significant changes in its served markets, particularly the domestic power generation market, and a weak industrial economy. The overall economic environment, and the industrial sector in particular, did not improve and provide opportunities for offsetting the decline in the power generation market. The softness in our markets, and intense competition that we have been reporting over the past quarters, is evident in

our fourth quarter results. The fiscal year results were favorably impacted by orders received during more favorable market conditions. Despite these volatile economic conditions, our new incoming orders for the fiscal year were $147 million, for a year to date book to ship ratio of 80 percent. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 book to ship ratio, while improved over the fourth quarter of the prior year, was 73%. The strong and improved earnings and cash flow performance of the past fiscal year resulted in an improved balance sheet, particularly the reduction in our outstanding debt. We ended the year with outstanding debt of $44.5 million down 30 percent or $19 million, when compared to the $63.5 million at February 28, 2002. Stringent cost controls, operating efficiency improvements, acquisition assimilation, and aggressive pursuit of all opportunities has contributed to the results for the past fiscal year, and has positioned us to better manage our operations in these current conditions, while maintaining our ability to capitalize on an improved economy."
 
Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment, including acquisitions, increased by 31 percent during the year to $134.9 million compared to $103.3 million in the previous year. Operating income for the segment increased 2 percent. Excluding the acquired businesses, revenues decreased 4 percent for the year and operating income decreased 1 percent.
 
Year-end revenues for the Company's Galvanizing Services Segment were $48.5 million compared to $49.6 million in the previous year; a decrease of 2 percent. Operating income for the year was $9.0 million; a 25 percent increase from last year.
 
Mr. Dingus continued, "We are particularly pleased with the results of our Galvanizing Services Segment. Despite a small decrease in volume, margins recovered significantly over the prior year. This was due to our cost containment efforts, complimented by favorable zinc and natural gas costs. When the industrial sector of the economy begins to show any improvement, our galvanizing, as well as industrial electrical segments, should begin to experience increased volume opportunities."
 
Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, management estimates FY 2004 earnings to be within the range of $.95 to $1.05 per diluted share, and revenues to be within the range of $145 to $155 million.

September 25, 2003  AZZ incorporated (NYSE:AZZ), a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services, today announced unaudited financial results for the three and six-month periods ended August 31, 2003. Revenues for the second quarter were $34.0 million, compared to $48.8 million for the comparable period last year. Net income for the second quarter was $1.0 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to net income of $2.6 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, in last year's fiscal second quarter.
FORT WORTH, TX
 
Backlog at the end of the second quarter was $48.5 million, compared to $ 45.7 million at the end of the first quarter and $49.1 million at end of the prior fiscal year end. Incoming orders for the second quarter totaled $36.8 million for a book to ship ratio of 108 percent for the quarter.
 
Outstanding debt at the end of the quarter was $32.2 million, down $7.9 million from the first quarter and down $12.4 from the year ended February 28,2003. AZZ's long-term debt to equity ratio of .40 to 1 at the end of the second quarter compares favorably to .77 to l for the same period last year.
 
For the six-month period, the Company reported revenues of $70.4 million, compared to $98.5 million for the comparable period last year. Net income for the six months was $1.9 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, compared to $5.2 million, or $0.99 per diluted share for the comparable six-month period last year. Incoming orders for the first six-month period were $69.8 million for a year to date book to ship ratio of 99 percent.
 
Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment were $22.1 million, compared to $36.3 million in the previous year's second quarter. Operating income for this Segment was $1.5 million, compared to $4.1 million in the second quarter of last year. For the first six months, revenues were $46.3 million and operating income was $3.0 million compared to $73.3 and $ 8.7 million respectively for the first six months of the prior year.
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of AZZ incorporated, commented, "While we have not seen any appreciable improvement in our market conditions, we remain cautiously optimistic that our markets have stabilized. Our quotation activity would support this, as well as, for the first time since the quarter ended in August 2001, our incoming orders exceeded our shipments for the quarter. With the reductions that we have made in our cost structure to better match our volume levels, and the improvement in our operating efficiency, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from any recovery we may see in our markets. The softness in the industrial markets combined with the continued deferral of needed upgrades to the transmission grid, has hampered our ability to offset the downturn in power generation projects. We are hopeful that recent events will reinforce the need to establish cost recovery methods for expenditures on the transmission grid, and we should begin to benefit from investment in the transmission grid and other infrastructure projects. Our products serving the distribution market have seen stable demand, and represent the largest portion of our backlog."
 
Revenues for the Company's Galvanizing Service Segment were $11.9 million for the second quarter, compared to $12.5 million in the previous year's comparable quarter. Operating income for the Segment was $2.0 million compared to $2.5 million in the same quarter last year. For the first six months of fiscal 2004, revenues were $24.1 million, and operating income was $4.0 million compared to $25.1 and $5.0 million respectively for the first six months of the prior year.
 
Mr. Dingus continued, "For many months, we have clearly felt the impact of the severe downturn in the steel fabrication market, particularly the cellular tower market. However, our volume levels during the last six months have been relatively consistent and lead us to believe that there has been some bottoming out in demand. Pricing pressures continue due to the imbalance between capacity and market demand. Operating margins continue to be negatively impacted by lower revenues, reduced selling prices and increased utility costs when compared to the same period last year. Our utility costs have increased 27 percent over the same period last year, and account for the largest portion of the reduction in operating margins when compared to the prior year. Favorable zinc cost has partially offset the unfavorable impact of reduced selling prices. Just as with our electrical and industrial products segment, any improvement in the industrial sector or the economy should provide for added volume and operating income opportunities for this segment."
 
Mr. Dingus concluded, "Due to the continued delays in receipt of key orders, particularly with those involved with high voltage transmission, and the timing of shipments of our backlog, we believe that we will not be able to achieve the earnings level that was provided in our previous guidance. Taking these factors into consideration, we believe that it is prudent to revise our previously issued earnings guidance for fiscal 2004. Our revised earning guidance is for earnings per diluted share to be within the range of $0.65 to $0.75, and revenues to be within the range of $125 to $135 million."
 
Based upon the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, the Board of Directors, at its regularly scheduled meeting on September 24, 2003, elected two members to the Board of Directors. This increases the size of the Board to eleven members, and increases the number of independent Directors to eight. Mr. W. C. Walker, a management consultant, and Mr. Robert H. Johnson, CPA and Financial Consultant were elected as Directors. Both of these gentlemen served as Directors of the Company for many years, and have served the last three years as an advisory director. Their extensive knowledge of the operations of the
Company, years of professional experience and experience as being a director of a public company, will provide additional guidance and leadership. The Company and Board of Directors are proud to announce their election to the Board of Directors of AZZ incorporated.

ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS
 
AZZ incorporated (the "Registrant") has reached an agreement in principal to amend its Amended and Restated Revolving and Term Credit Agreement dated as of November 1, 2001 (as since amended the "Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, N. A. (the "Administrative Agent") and other lenders (the "Lenders") in order to maintain the highest level of liquidity and better align its credit facility with the current business environment. This amendment would amend certain terms and provisions of the Credit Agreement by reducing the number of banks in the current banking facility from five banks to three banks, by reducing the Registrant's Revolving Credit Commitment from $45 million to $20 million, extending the Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, of 2.50:1 through 2/27/05 and 2.25:1 for the period ending 2/28/05 and thereafter, adjusting the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, to 1.10:1 for the periods ending 8/31/03 through 2/27/05 and to 1.25:1 for the period ending 2/28/05 and thereafter, and eliminating the Minimum Quarterly EBITDA covenant which is calculated on the last day of each month for the three month period then ended (the "EBITDA Covenant"). The EBITDA Covenant requires EBITDA of not less than $4,000,000 beginning with the three month period ended September 30, 2003 and ending with the month ended January 31, 2005 and not less than $4,500,000 for the period beginning with the month ended February 28, 2005 and thereafter. EBITDA means the sum of (i) Consolidated Net Income as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus (ii) the sum of all amounts deducted there from during such period in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, for interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. In order to allow time for the documentation and signing of the amendment between the Registrant and the Administrative Agent and Lenders, the Administrative Agent and Lenders have waived compliance by the Registrant with the EBITDA Covenant, for and only for the three-month period ending on September 30, 2003. While Registrant will not be in compliance with the EBITDA Covenant for that three-month period, the Agent and Lenders have agreed that the noncompliance by the Registrant with such Section for such period shall not constitute a default under the Credit Agreement. It is anticipated that this amendment will be executed by no later than October 31, 2003, the next date at which the minimum three month EBITDA Covenant is measured under the Credit Agreement.

EXHIBIT 99.8
 
 
 
 - AZZ incorporated (NYSE:AZZ), a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services, today announced unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 29, 2004. Revenues for the fourth quarter were $32.5 million compared to $39.8 million for the same quarter last year. Net income for the quarter was $1.2 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.4 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, in last year's fiscal fourth quarter. Incoming orders for the fourth quarter were $33.1 million for a book to ship ratio of 102 percent for the quarter.
April 15, 2004
FORT WORTH, TX
 
For the year, the Company reported unaudited revenues of $136.2 million compared to fiscal year 2003 revenues of $183.4 million. Net income for the year was $4.3 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, compared to net income of $8.6 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, last year. Guidance, which had previously been issued for fiscal 2004, was for earnings per diluted share of $0.72 to $0.78 and revenues of $135 to $140 million. Backlog at year-end was $53.1 million compared to $49.1 million at the end of fiscal 2003. Incoming orders were $140.2 for the year and resulted in a book to ship ratio of 103% for the year.
 
Outstanding bank debt at the end of the fiscal year was $30.9 million, a decrease of $13.7 million from the year ended February 28, 2003. AZZ's long-term debt to equity ratio of .37 to 1 at the end of the fiscal year compares favorably to the .60 to 1 for the same period last year.
 
Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment were $21.5 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $28.3 million for the comparable period last year. Operating income for this segment was $1.7 million, compared to $2.8 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For the fiscal year ended February 29, 2004, revenues for this segment were $88.9 million and operating income was $ 6.4 million compared to $134.9 million and $14.9 million, respectively, for the prior fiscal year.
 
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of AZZ incorporated commented, "The operating results for the quarter and year exceeded our internal expectations and earnings guidance we had previously issued, despite a continuation of the difficult market conditions and intense competition. We have sized our operations to reflect these conditions and have continued our efforts to improve operating efficiencies and financial performance. Improvement in coverage and participation in the international electrical markets was a key goal we set for ourselves. Fiscal 2004 saw some encouraging results in this program. With our previously

announced operating structure in China and, improved representation in the Middle East and Asia, we are better positioned to take advantage of these market which are experiencing growth. We believe all actions that have been taken in fiscal 2004 do position us to better compete in both domestic and international markets and we are positioned well to benefit from sustained recovery in our served markets. Additionally, we did see improvement in the fourth quarter of our quotation and bookings activity related to our transmission products, and we are encouraged by the increased quotation activity. ."
 
Revenues for the Company's Galvanizing Services Segment were $11.0 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $11.5 million in the previous year's comparable quarter. Operating income for the segment was $2.4 million for the quarter, compared to $ 2.0 million in the previous year's comparable quarter. For the fiscal year ended February 29, 2004, revenues were $47.3 million and operating income was $8.6 million compared to $48.5 million and $9.0 million, respectively for the prior fiscal year.
 
Mr. Dingus continued, "Despite the complexities brought about by the changes in price of steel and zinc, we had another solid year in our Galvanizing Services Segment. The decrease in operating income on a year over year basis can be directly linked to increased cost of natural gas. Going forward, we will be faced with the potential impact of steel price increases on our volume levels, and our ability to offset increases in the cost of zinc with improved efficiency and price increases. While market conditions may inhibit our ability to fully recover the anticipated increases, we are anticipating another solid year of performance from this segment."
 
Mr. Dingus concluded, "Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are estimating FY 2005 earnings to be within the range of $0.75 to $0.85 per diluted share, and revenues to be within the range of $140 to $150 million. Included in our projected earnings is a one-time expenditure of approximately $ 650,000 to be expensed during fiscal 2005 associated with the implementation cost of our ERP system. Anticipated benefits will be realized in FY 2006."
 
AZZ incorporated will conduct a conference call to discuss financial results for fiscal year 2004 at 4:15 P.M. Eastern on April 15, 2004.

September 23, 2004  - AZZ incorporated (NYSE:AZZ), a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services, today announced unaudited financial results for the three and six-month periods ended August 31, 2004. Revenues for the second quarter were $36.5 million, compared to $34.0 million for the comparable period last year. Net income for the second quarter was $0.9 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.0 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, in last year's fiscal second quarter.
FORT WORTH, TX
 
Backlog at the end of the second quarter was $53.8 million, compared to $ 51.9 million at the end of the previous quarter and $48.5 million for the comparable period last year. Incoming orders for the second quarter totaled $38.4 million for a book to ship ratio of 105 percent for the quarter.
 
Outstanding debt at the end of the quarter was $28.6 million, down 11 percent from the comparable period last year. AZZ's long-term debt to equity ratio is now .32 to 1. Compliance cost associated with Sarbanes Oxley and implementation cost associated with our new Oracle ERP system in the amount of $399,000 are included in Selling, General and Administrative expense for the six month period ending August 31, 2004.
 
For the six-month period, the Company reported revenues of $76.2 million, compared to $70.4 million for the comparable period last year. Net income for the six months was $2.2 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared to $1.9 million, or $0.35 per diluted share for the comparable six-month period last year. Incoming orders for the first six-month period were $76.9 million for a year to date book to ship ratio of 101 percent.
 
Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment were $23.4 million for the second quarter, compared to $22.1 million in the previous year's second quarter. Operating income for this segment was $1.3 million, compared to $1.5 million in the second quarter of last year.

David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of AZZ incorporated, commented, "Quotation activity in our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment continued to show some signs of improvement, both domestically and internationally. While our second quarter book to ship ratio showed improvement over the first quarter, several projects continued to be delayed due to some remaining economic uncertainty in the industrial markets, and pending energy legislation. Competitive pricing pressures continued and some opportunities were lost due to pricing being below our acceptable margin level. Additionally, margins continued to be adversely impacted by our inability to pass along many of the material cost increases we have incurred, due again to competitive pricing levels. We remain optimistic that our efforts to continually improve on our operating efficiency and lower our internal cost structure, combined with our expansion of served markets, should facilitate future improvement in revenues and operating margins."
 
Revenues for the Company's Galvanizing Service Segment were $13.1 million for the second quarter, compared to $11.9 million in the previous year's comparable quarter. Operating income for the Segment was $2.4 million compared to $2.0 million in the same quarter last year. For the first six months of fiscal 2004, revenues were $25.2 million, and operating income was $4.7 million compared to $24.1 and $4.0 million, respectively, for the first six months of the prior year.
 
Mr. Dingus continued, "We are very pleased with the operating results of this segment for the second quarter and year-to-date. The stabilization of our served markets, the ability to recover our cost increases in our pricing, and the leverage gained from prior adjustments to our cost and operating structure, allowed us to show a substantial improvement in margins on a modest increase in volume. We believe that a sustained improvement in our served markets will continue to reflect improved operating results for this Segment."
 
Mr. Dingus concluded, "On a year to date basis, our revenues and income are consistent with our internal targets. This combined with the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are continuing to estimate FY2005 earnings to be within the range of $0.75 to $0.85 per diluted share and revenues to be within the range of $140 to $150 million. Our earnings per share estimate includes the portion of Oracle ERP system implementation project cost of $650,000, which does not qualify for capitalization, in fiscal 2005. Approximately $280,000 of this amount was incurred in the first six months of the current fiscal year.
 
AZZ incorporated will conduct a conference call to discuss financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 at 4:15 P.M. Eastern on September 23, 2004. Interested parties can access the call at (719) 457-2625. The call will be web cast via the Internet at www.azz.com/AZZinvest.htm. A replay of the call will be available for three days at (719) 457-0820, confirmation #265129, or for 30 days at www.azz.com/AZZinvest.htm.

Exhibit 99.8
 
 
 
 
January 6, 2005  - AZZ incorporated (NYSE:AZZ), a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services today announced unaudited financial results for the three and nine-month periods ended November 30, 2004. Revenues for the third quarter were $38.3 million, compared to $33.3 million for the comparable period last year. Net income for the third quarter was $1.2 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.2 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, in last year's fiscal third quarter.
FORT WORTH, TX
 
Backlog at the end of the third quarter was $60.1 million, compared to $ 53.8 million at the end of the previous quarter and $52.5 million for the comparable period last year. Incoming orders for the third quarter totaled $44.6 million while shipments for the quarter totaled $38.3 million, resulting in a book to ship ratio of 116 percent.
 
Outstanding debt at the end of the quarter was $27.8 million, down 10 percent from the February 29,2004, fiscal year end, resulting in a long-term debt to equity ratio of .30 to 1. Shareholders Equity increased to $73.3 million or $13.30 per diluted share.
 
For the nine-month period, the Company reported revenues of $114.5 million, compared to $103.7 million for the comparable period last year. Net income for the nine months was $3.4 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, compared to $3.0 million, or $0.57 per diluted share for the comparable nine-month period last year. Incoming orders for the nine-month period were $121.5 million, while year to date shipments totaled $114.5 million, resulting in a book to ship ratio of 106 percent. Implementation cost associated with the installation of our new ERP system in the amount of $505,000 for the nine-month period are included in Selling, General and Administrative expense for the nine month period ending November 30, 2004.
 
Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment were $25.0 million for the third quarter, compared to $21.1 million in the previous year's third quarter. Operating income for this segment was $1.7 million, compared to $1.6 million in the third quarter of last year. For the first nine months, revenues were $76.0 million and operating income was $5.0 million compared to $67.4 and $ 4.6 million, respectively, for the first nine months of the prior year.
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of AZZ incorporated, commented, "We are pleased to see an increase in quotation activity in our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment, both domestically and internationally. We have been disappointed that this improved quotation level has not lead to improved pricing opportunities. Competitive pricing pressures continue as our industry still operates with a significant level of unused capacity. As we have seen in previous quarters of the current fiscal year, some opportunities were lost due to pricing being below our acceptable margin level. Pricing pressures combined with our inability to pass along many of the material cost increases we have incurred, continue to put downward margin pressure on our operating results. We will seek out all opportunities to recover our cost increases while continuing our efforts to improve our operating efficiency, lower our internal cost structure, and expand our served markets. Further sustained recovery of our served markets should lead to a better industry matching of capacity and demand, and assist us in our margin improvement efforts."
 
Revenues for the Company's Galvanizing Service Segment were $13.3 million for the third quarter, compared to $12.2 million in the previous year's comparable quarter. Operating income for the Segment was $2.4 million compared to $2.3 million in the same quarter last year. For the first nine months of fiscal 2004, revenues were $38.5 million, and operating income was $7.1 million compared to $36.3 and $6.3 million, respectively, for the first nine months of the prior year.
 
Mr. Dingus continued, "We have seen another quarter where the leverage that has been gained from market stabilization and some modest recovery improved our operating performance. The revenue and operating income for this segment continues at an encouraging pace. Zinc and natural gas cost continue to be extremely volatile, making it an extremely challenging environment to match our pricing and cost, and sustain our margin performance. While not as severe as in our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment, market capacity does exceed demand and inhibits our ability to achieve higher operating performance. We believe that a sustained improvement in our served markets should continue to reflect improved operating results for this Segment."
 
Mr. Dingus concluded, "On a year to date basis, our revenues and income are consistent with our internal targets. This combined with the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are continuing to estimate FY2005 earnings to be within the range of $0.75 to $0.85 per diluted share and revenues to be within the range of $140 to $150 million. Our earnings per share estimate includes the portion of Oracle ERP system implementation project cost of $650,000, which does not qualify for capitalization, in fiscal 2005.

On May 18, 2005, the Board of Directors approved two compensation plans; the 2006 Stock Appreciation Rights Plan for Directors and the 2006 Stock Appreciation Rights Plan for Key Employees. Our non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the Director Plan, and our executive officers are eligible to participate in the Key Employee Plan.
 
The Board approved the grant of rights under the Plans. All rights that have not previously accelerated due to events such as death or disability will vest when AZZ releases earnings for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2008. The value of each vested right will be paid in cash and such value shall be equal to the excess, if any, (i) of the average of the closing prices of a share of Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange for those days on which it trades during the ninety calendar days immediately following the public release of financial results for the year ended February 29, 2008, over (ii) the average of the closing prices of a share of Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange for those days on which it trades during the ninety calendar days immediately following the date on which AZZ released its earnings for the year ended February 28, 2005. The number of Stock Appreciation Rights granted to each participant will then be multiplied by the excess in the average stock price to determine the cash payment. The value of rights vesting before the normal vesting date will be measured by reference to the price of the Common Stock during a period at or near the accelerated vesting date.

AZZ incorporated, a Texas corporation (the "Company"), hereby establishes and sets forth the terms of the AZZ incorporated, FISCAL YEAR 2006 STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS PLAN FOR KEY EMPLOYEES (the "Plan") to be effective May 18, 2005.
 
ARTICLE 1. PURPOSE OF PLAN
 
The purpose of this Plan is to enable the Company to attract and retain key employees of the highest caliber by offering to them an opportunity to share in increases in the value of the Company to which they contribute. This Plan will seek to accomplish this purpose by granting such employees stock appreciation rights (collectively, the "Rights" and individually, a "Right"), which will be associated with shares of common stock of the Company, one dollar ($1.00) par value (the "Common Stock"), and which will be subject to all of the terms and conditions contained in this Plan.
 
ARTICLE 2. ADMINISTRATION OF PLAN
 
This Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Administrative Committee").
2.1
 
A majority of the members of the Administrative Committee shall constitute a quorum. All actions of the Administrative Committee shall require the affirmative vote of members who constitute a majority of such quorum.
2.2
 
The Administrative Committee shall have the following rights and powers:
2.3
 
 
ARTICLE 3. ELIGIBILITY AND GRANT
 
An individual shall be eligible to participate in this Plan provided that such individual (i) is an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company (as defined below), (ii) is determined by the Administrative Committee to be a key employee of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, and (iii) is selected by the Administrative Committee to receive Rights under this Plan.
3.1
 
A key employee of the Company so selected by the Administrative Committee may be granted a Right only by a written Stock Appreciation Rights Agreement signed by the Company and such key employee, in form and substance approved by the Administrative Committee, in accordance with Article 12 hereof. Each key employee of the Company who so enters into a written Stock Appreciation Rights Agreement with the Company shall sometimes be referred to in this Plan as a "Holder."
3.2
 
ARTICLE 4. TERMS OF RIGHTS
 
Each Right granted to a Holder selected by the Administrative Committee in accordance with Section 3 shall have the following terms:
 
The Right shall be granted effective as of the effective date of the Stock Appreciation Rights Agreement evidencing the grant of the Right;
4.1
 
The Right shall be associated with one share of Common Stock;
4.2
 
Unless it earlier terminates as provided in Section 9, the Right shall vest (if the Holder is still employed by the Company at such time) upon the public release of financial results by the Company for its fiscal year ending on February 29, 2008 (the "Normal Vesting Date") or (if the Holder is still employed by the Company at such time) upon the occurrence of an Accelerating Event under Section 10.2, which shall accelerate vesting (the "Accelerated Vesting Date") as provided in Section 10.2;
4.3
 
Each Right shall have a base value (the "Base Value") equal to the average of the closing prices of one share of the Common Stock as listed on the New York Stock Exchange for those days on which it trades during the ninety calendar days period immediately following the public release of financial results for the Company's fiscal year ended February 28, 2005; and
4.4
 
Each Right shall be subject to such other terms and conditions as the Administrative Committee deems advisable and as are consistent with the terms and conditions of this Plan. Except as expressly provided herein, nothing contained in this Plan shall require that the terms and conditions of Rights granted hereunder be uniform.
4.5
 
 
ARTICLE 5. LIMITATIONS ON NUMBER OF RIGHTS AND DATE OF GRANT
 
The aggregate number of Rights that may be granted under this Plan and the maximum number of Rights which may be granted to any one individual during any calendar year shall be [one hundred fifteen thousand (115,000)]. This number shall be subject to any adjustment required or permitted pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.
5.1
 
No Rights may be granted under this Plan after May 18, 2005.
5.2
 
ARTICLE 6. APPRECIATION AMOUNT
 
Effective as of the Normal Vesting Date or Accelerated Vesting Date of a Right, the Holder of the Right shall have the full, unconditional and nonforfeitable ownership of the Right and shall be entitled to receive the amount by which the fair market value (the "FMV") of one share of Common Stock as determined by the methods provided below exceeds the Base Value of the Right (the "Appreciation Amount"). Prior to the occurrence of a Normal Vesting Date or Accelerated Vesting Date, a Right may be terminated or otherwise adjusted as allowed herein.
6.1
 
The FMV for the purpose of calculating the Appreciation Amount for a Right that reaches maturity on the Normal Vesting Date, shall be the average of the closing prices of one share of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange for those days on which it traded during the ninety calendar days period immediately following the public release of financial results for the Company's fiscal year ended February 29, 2008 (the "Normal Determination Period"). The FMV for the purpose of calculating the Appreciation Amount for a Right that reaches maturity on an Accelerated Vesting Date shall be determined as set forth in Section 10.2 below (an "Accelerated Determination Period").
6.2
 
ARTICLE 7. PAYMENT OF APPRECIATION AMOUNT
 
 
 
In the event of the death of a Holder of a Right, that has not been terminated, the right to receive any Appreciation Amounts due to the Holder pursuant to this Plan may pass to the person or persons entitled thereto pursuant to the will of the Holder or, if no such will exists, pursuant to applicable laws of descent and distribution.
7.2
 
The Company shall be entitled to deduct from any payment required by this Plan (including any Appreciation Amounts payable under Section 10.2) any amounts that the Company is required by applicable federal, state or local law to withhold therefrom on account of employment, income or similar taxes.
7.3
 
ARTICLE 8. NATURE OF RIGHTS
 
The Rights are intended solely as a means to measure the Appreciation Amounts that may become payable under this Plan. The Rights shall not constitute equity or other securities of the Company, and Holders of Rights shall not be shareholders of the Company and shall not have any right of access to financial or other information regarding the Company. The Company shall not be required to set aside any amounts for purposes of this Plan, in trust or otherwise, in advance of the respective dates prescribed for the payment of Appreciation Amounts. All Holders shall, except as otherwise provided by law, be general creditors of the Company with respect to the Rights and the right to payment of any Appreciation Amounts under this Plan.
8.1
 
Except as expressly allowed in Section 7.2 above or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order (within the meaning of Section 414(p) of the Code), no Holder shall have any right to sell, assign, pledge or otherwise transfer the Rights or any other rights that the Holder may have under this Plan, and any attempt to do so shall be void.

ARTICLE 1. PURPOSE OF PLAN
 
The purpose of this Plan is to enable the Company to attract and retain directors of the highest caliber by offering to them an opportunity to share in increases in the value of the Company to which they contribute. This Plan will seek to accomplish this purpose by granting such directors stock appreciation rights (collectively, the "Rights" and individually, a "Right"), which will be associated with shares of common stock of the Company, one dollar ($1.00) par value (the "Common Stock"), and which will be subject to all of the terms and conditions contained in this Plan.
 
ARTICLE 2. ADMINISTRATION OF PLAN
 
This Plan shall be administered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Administrative Committee").
2.1
 
A majority of the members of the Administrative Committee shall constitute a quorum. All actions of the Administrative Committee shall require the affirmative vote of members who constitute a majority of such quorum.
2.2
 
The Administrative Committee shall have the following rights and powers:

ARTICLE 3. ELIGIBILITY AND GRANT
 
An individual shall be eligible to participate in this Plan provided that such individual is a non-employee director of the Company (a "Director")

A Director of the Company may be granted a Right only by a written Stock Appreciation Rights Agreement signed by the Company and the Director granting to a Director a number of SARs in accordance with action taken by the Board of Directors, in form and substance approved by the Administrative Committee, in accordance with Article 12 hereof. Each Director of the Company who so enters into a written Stock Appreciation Rights Agreement with the Company shall sometimes be referred to in this Plan as a "Holder."
3.2
 
ARTICLE 4. TERMS OF RIGHTS
 
Each Right granted to a Holder in accordance with Section 3 shall have the following terms:
 
The Right shall be granted effective as of the effective date of the Stock Appreciation Rights Agreement evidencing the grant of the Right;

The Right shall be associated with one share of Common Stock;

Unless it earlier terminates as provided in Section 9, the Right shall vest (if the Holder is still a Director at such time) upon the public release of financial results by the Company for its fiscal year ending on February 29, 2008 (the "Normal Vesting Date") or (if the Holder is still a Director at such time) upon the occurrence of an Accelerating Event under Section 10.2, which shall accelerate vesting (the "Accelerated Vesting Date") as provided in Section 10.2;
4.3
 
Each Right shall have a base value (the "Base Value") equal to the average of the closing prices of one share of the Common Stock as listed on the New York Stock Exchange for those days on which it trades during the ninety calendar days period immediately following the public release of financial results for the Company's fiscal year ended February 28, 2005; and
4.4
 
Each Right shall be subject to such other terms and conditions as the Administrative Committee deems advisable and as are consistent with the terms and conditions of this Plan.

Effective as of the Normal Vesting Date or Accelerated Vesting Date of a Right, the Holder of the Right shall have the full, unconditional and nonforfeitable ownership of the Right and shall be entitled to receive the amount by which the fair market value (the "FMV") of one share of Common Stock as determined by the methods provided below exceeds the Base Value of the Right (the "Appreciation Amount"). Prior to the occurrence of a Normal Vesting Date or Accelerated Vesting Date, a Right may be terminated or otherwise adjusted as allowed herein.

The FMV for the purpose of calculating the Appreciation Amount for a Right that reaches maturity on the Normal Vesting Date, shall be the average of the closing prices of one share of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange for those days on which it traded during the ninety calendar days period immediately following the public release of financial results for the Company's fiscal year ended February 29, 2008 (the "Normal Determination Period").

ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
Attached is Exhibit 99.1, AZZ incorporated's Press Release reporting the Company's unaudited earnings and other selected financial information for the three month period ended May 31, 2005, dated June 24, 2005.

Attached is Exhibit 99.2, Unaudited Financial and Other Statistical Information, for the three month period ended May 31, 2005 and Guidance for Fiscal Year 2006, which compiles AZZ incorporated's unaudited financial and other statistical information for the three month period ended May 31, 2005 and provides forward looking guidance for the fiscal year ending February 28, 2006. The guidance for the fiscal year to end February 28, 2006, consists of either a projected range or management's estimate of most likely results.

The following exhibits are filed as part of this report.
 
 
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
Except for the statements of historical fact, this report may contain "forward-looking statements" that involve risks and uncertainties that are detailed from time to time in documents filed by the Company with the SEC. Those risks, uncertainties, and factors include, but are not limited to: change in demand, prices and raw material cost, including zinc which is used in the hot dip galvanizing process; changes in the economic conditions of the various markets the Company serves, foreign and domestic, acquisition opportunities, adequacy of financing, and availability of experienced management employees to implement the Company's growth strategy; and customer demand and response to products and services offered by the Company. The Company can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
For the first quarterRevenues Increase13%: Net Income Up 71%; Earnings per Share Increase 65%; Backlog Increases 25%
 
 
 - AZZ incorporated , a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services, today announced unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended May 31, 2005. Revenues for the first quarter increased 13 percent to $44.7 million compared to $39.7 million for the same quarter last year. Net income for the quarter increased to $2.1 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.2 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in last year's fiscal first quarter, an increase of 71 and 65 percent, respectively. Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $65.0 million versus $51.9 million at May 31, 2004, an increase of 25 percent. Backlog at February 28, 2005 year-end was $64.8 million. Incoming orders for the first quarter totaled $45.0 million while shipments for the quarter totaled $44.7 million, resulting in a book to ship ratio of 101 percent. Incoming orders increased 17 percent over the same period of a year ago, and compare favorably to incoming orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, reflecting a 6 percent increase.
June 24, 2005
FORT WORTH, TX
(NYSE:AZZ)
 
Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment increased by 4 percent during the first quarter to $28.8 million compared to $27.6 million in the previous year. Operating income for the segment increased 9 percent to $2.1 million.
 
Revenue for the Company's Galvanizing Service Segment for the first quarter was $15.9 million, an increase of 32 percent compared to the $12.1 million in the same period last year. Operating income improved 60 percent to $3.7 million.
 
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of AZZ incorporated, commented, "We are pleased to report the double digit increases in our operating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2006. In the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment, we have seen improvement in our markets; however, competitive pricing pressures continue to inhibit our ability to further increase our volumes and profitability. We continue our emphasis on booking of business at specific targeted margin levels and pursue pricing actions that will recover the significant increases in the price of steel, aluminum and copper that we have incurred over the past year. The increase in incoming orders for this Segment during the first quarter over the same period in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to strong bookings in the high voltage transmission, petroleum, and mining markets. Distribution and power generation orders were essentially flat with prior periods. The Galvanizing Services Segment achieved record setting results in the first quarter. The excellent

operating results are reflective of improved market conditions and aggressive pursuit of pricing opportunities to offset the increasing cost of zinc and the continuing high cost of natural gas. This segment was very favorably impacted by the leverage gained from increased volumes."
 
Mr. Dingus concluded, "Operating efficiency improvement, cost containment, cost escalation recovery through pricing actions, expansion of domestic and international served markets, and seeking out new product opportunities to further enhance our strategic position, continues to be the focus and emphasis of our activities. Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are increasing our estimate of FY2006 earnings to be within the range of $1.08 to $1.18 per diluted share and revenues to be within the range of $170 to $180 million. Our earnings per share estimate includes the completion of Oracle ERP system implementation costs and Sarbanes-Oxley compliance costs of $550,000, which compares to an actual expense of $775,000 for fiscal 2005."

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
2005 Long Term Incentive Plan
 
On May 9, 2005, the board of directors approved AZZ incorporated's 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "LTIP") to become effective on that date, subject to the approval of the shareholders. On July 12, 2005, the shareholders of the company approved the LTIP in the form recommended by the board of directors at the annual meeting of shareholders. The following description of the LTIP was included in, and a copy of the plan was attached to, the proxy statement delivered to shareholders for the annual meeting and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 7, 2005. A copy of the LTIP is also attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated into this filing by reference. The following summary of the plan is not intended to be complete.
 
The purpose of the LTIP is to promote AZZ's growth and general prosperity by enabling the Company to grant to its employees and directors awards of stock options, performance awards, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights and stock unit awards. The LTIP is designed to assist the Company and its subsidiaries in attracting and retaining superior personnel for positions of substantial responsibility, to provide employees and directors with an additional incentive to contribute to the success of AZZ and to align employees' and directors' long-term financial interests with those of its other shareholders.
 
Available Shares
 
The maximum number of shares of AZZ common stock which may be issued under the LTIP (or with respect to which awards may be granted) is 250,000 shares. The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be granted to any one person during any calendar year is 100,000 shares. Shares issued under the LTIP may be either authorized and unissued shares of common stock or shares of common stock issued and later acquired by AZZ. Any shares of common stock subject to a stock option that are not issued prior to the time the award expires, or any restricted stock that is forfeited, will again be available for award under the LTIP.
 
Persons Eligible To Participate
 
All AZZ employees and directors are eligible to participate in the LTIP. Subject to the provisions of the LTIP, the compensation committee of the board of directors may grant awards in its sole discretion. Awards of incentive stock options, however, may be granted only to persons who are employees of AZZ or of an affiliate whose employees qualify, under federal income tax law, to receive incentive stock options.
 
Administration
 
The compensation committee has broad powers under the LTIP to, among other things, administer and interpret the LTIP, establish guidelines for the LTIP's operation, select persons to whom awards are to be made under the LTIP, determine the types and sizes of awards to be granted under the LTIP and determine other terms and conditions of an award. In addition, except as the LTIP otherwise provides, the committee also has the power to waive restrictions or limitations on the exercisability of awards and to accelerate and extend existing awards. The compensation committee also has the power to modify or amend the terms of existing awards.
 
Types of Awards
 
The LTIP provides for the grant of any or all of the following types of awards:
 
 
 
 
 
. Under the LTIP, the committee may grant awards in the form of options to purchase shares of common stock. Options may be in the form of incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. The committee will, with regard to each stock option, determine the number of shares subject to the option, the term of the option (which, for both incentive and nonqualified stock options, may not exceed ten years), the exercise price per share of stock subject to the option (which, for both incentive and nonqualified stock options, must not be less than the fair market value of the shares of common stock at the time of grant), the vesting schedule (which will be over a four year term, unless the committee determines otherwise), and the other material terms of the option. Any option granted in the form of an incentive stock option must satisfy the applicable requirements of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
Stock Options
 
The option price upon exercise shall be paid by the optionee, as the committee may in each case determine:
 
 
 
 
 
 
. The LTIP authorizes the committee to grant awards in the form of restricted shares of AZZ common stock. The awards may be in amounts and subject to terms and conditions the committee may determine, provided that the shares will be restricted for a period of not more than ten years. During this period, the sale, assignment, transfer, pledge or other encumbrance of the shares is restricted, and the shares are subject to forfeiture to AZZ in the event the awardee ends his position as an employee or director of AZZ or one of its subsidiaries before the period of restriction expires. However, if an awardee's employment or service ends due to his death, permanent disability or retirement, or termination without cause, or constructive termination after a change in control (as defined in the LTIP), his shares are not forfeited.
Restricted Stock Awards
 
The LTIP also authorizes the committee to grant awards in the form of stock appreciation rights. A stock appreciation right represents the right to receive payment in cash, AZZ common stock or a combination of cash and common stock in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value (as defined in the LTIP) of a specified number of shares of AZZ common stock at the time the right is exercised over the exercise price of such right at the time it was granted (which may not be less than 100% of the fair market value (as defined in the LTIP) of the same number of share of AZZ common stock at the time the right was granted). The committee has the authority to designate the terms and conditions of stock appreciation rights granted under the LTIP, which terms may differ from one grant to another, although rights may
Stock Appreciation Rights.
not expire more than ten years from the date of grant. All AZZ employees and directors are eligible to receive stock appreciation rights, and, as a condition to receiving an award, each awardee must enter a written stock appreciation rights agreement with the Company.
 
The committee may also grant stock unit awards under the LTIP. Awards of stock units are denominated in shares of common stock, but may be paid either in shares of common stock or cash, as the committee determines. The committee has the authority to designate the terms and conditions of stock unit awards granted under the LTIP, which terms may differ from one grant to another, although awards may not expire [less than three or] more than ten years from the date of grant. All AZZ employees and directors are eligible to receive these awards, and, as a condition to receiving an award, each awardee must enter a written stock unit award agreement with the Company.
Stock Unit Awards.
 
. The LTIP also authorizes the committee to grant performance awards. These awards are divided into two categories:
Performance Awards
 
 
 
The committee can grant performance awards for no cash consideration or for any other consideration required by law or specified at the time of the grant. Each performance award will have its own terms and conditions (determined and modified at the committee's discretion), which can include provisions establishing the performance period, the performance criteria to be achieved during a performance period and the maximum and minimum settlement values. These awards may be valued according to the fair market value of AZZ shares or any method chosen by the committee. Performance awards may be paid in cash, shares of AZZ common stock (including restricted stock) and/or other consideration. Achievement of the performance objective can constitute consideration as well. These awards may be paid in a single payment or in installments and can be paid at a specified date or upon attaining the performance objective, all at the committee's discretion. All AZZ employees and directors are eligible to receive these awards, and, as a condition to receiving an award, each awardee must enter a written performance award agreement with the Company.
 
Termination of Awards
 
Awards of options granted under the LTIP may terminate early upon the death, disability, or termination of awardee's employment. If an awardee's employment is terminated for cause, the awardee's awards (other than restricted stock that has already vested) will automatically expire on the termination date.
 
Compliance With Securities Laws
 
No awards may be granted under the LTIP unless the Company complies with applicable securities laws and lists the shares of common stock granted by awards with the New York Stock Exchange. With regard to any shares granted under the LTIP through options or restricted stock, AZZ management plans to register these shares under the federal securities laws and list them with the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Transferability
 
Awards granted under the LTIP (other than restricted stock that has fully vested) cannot be
transferred except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, or with respect to nonqualified stock options, by the terms of a qualified domestic relations order. Incentive stock options awarded under the LTIP may be exercised during the life of an optionee only by the optionee or his legally authorized representative. The committee, in its discretion, may permit nonqualified stock options to be transferred to members of the awardee's immediate family, trusts for the benefit of immediate family members, and partnerships in which immediate family members are the only partners, but only if there is no consideration for the transfer.
 
Acceleration of Awards
 
The committee may accelerate the exercisability or other vesting of any award at any time. Awards granted under the LTIP will vest in full immediately if AZZ experiences an actual or a threatened change in control (as determined by the committee in its sole discretion).
 
Term
 
The LTIP terminates on May 9, 2015. No award will be granted under the LTIP after that date.
 
Independent Director Compensation Plan
 
On July 12, 2005, the compensation committee of the board of directors of the registrant recommended to the board, and the board approved, the Independent Director Compensation Plan (the "Plan") for the independent directors, which is to remain in place until replaced or modified by the board. The following is a description of the Plan provided pursuant to Paragraph 10 (iii) (B) to Item 601 of Regulation S-K, which requires a written description of a compensatory plan when no formal document contains the compensation information.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to Paragraph 10 (iii) (B) to Item 601 of Regulation S-K, a copy of the foregoing description is also included as Exhibit 10.2 hereto and is incorporated into this filing by reference.
 
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
SIGNATURES
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

EXHIBIT 10.1
 
 
 
1.1 This Plan shall be known as the "AZZ incorporated 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan." Capitalized terms used herein are defined in Article IX hereof.
Name.
 
1.2 The purpose of the Plan is to promote the growth and general prosperity of the Company by permitting the Company to award to its Employees and Directors shares of Common Stock of the Company and options to purchase Common Stock in the form of Incentive Stock Options, Non-qualified Stock Options, Performance Awards, Restricted Stock, Stock Appreciation Rights and Stock Unit Awards. The Plan is designed to help the Company and its Affiliates attract and retain superior personnel for positions of substantial responsibility, to provide Employees and Directors with an additional incentive to contribute to the long-term performance and success of the Company and to align Employees' and Directors' long-term financial interests with those of the Company's stockholders. The Company intends that Incentive Stock Options granted pursuant to Article III shall qualify as "incentive stock options" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code.
Purpose.
 
1.3 The Plan shall become effective upon the Effective Date; provided, however, that if the shareholders of the Company have not approved the Plan by the date that is twelve months after the Effective Date, the Plan and all grants made under the Plan shall be void and of no force or effect.
Effective Date.
 
1.4 Any Employee or Director shall be eligible to participate in the Plan. Subject to the following provisions, the Committee may make Awards in accordance with such determinations as the Committee from time to time in its sole discretion shall make; provided, however, that Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to persons who are Employees.
Eligibility to Participate.
 
1.5 The shares of Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Plan shall be either authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock or shares of Common Stock issued and thereafter acquired by the Company in open market transactions or otherwise.
Shares Subject to the Plan.
 
1.6 Subject to adjustment pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.2, and subject to any additional restrictions elsewhere in the Plan, the maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued and sold hereunder shall not exceed 250,000 shares, and the maximum aggregate number of Plan Shares with respect to which Awards may be granted to any person during any calendar year shall not exceed 100,000 shares.
Maximum Number of Plan Shares.
 
1.7 Plan Shares with respect to which an Option or Stock Appreciation Right has been exercised or Restricted Stock or Stock Unit Awards have vested and Plan Shares which have been issued in connection with Performance Awards shall not
Shares Granted Under Plan.
 
again be available for grant hereunder. If Options or Stock Appreciation Rights terminate for any reason without being wholly exercised, if Restricted Stock or Stock Unit Awards are forfeited prior to vesting or if Plan Shares are not issued under Performance Awards, the number of Plan Shares underlying such Award shall not count towards the maximum aggregate number of Plan Shares that may be issued under the Plan as set forth in Section 1.6, and new Awards may be granted hereunder covering the number of Plan Shares to which such termination, forfeiture or lapse relates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent required for Awards intended to constitute "qualified performance-based compensation" under Code Section 162(m) to satisfy the requirements for deductibility under Code Section 162(m), Plan Shares subject to an Option or Stock Appreciation Right that is cancelled shall not again be available under the Plan for purposes of Section 1.6 and such other purposes, if any, as are required to satisfy such requirements under Code Section 162(m).
 
1.8 The Company shall not issue any certificate for Plan Shares pursuant to the Plan prior to fulfillment of all of the following conditions:
Conditions Precedent.
 
(a) the admission of the Plan Shares to listing on all stock exchanges on which the Common Stock is then listed, unless the Committee determines in its sole discretion that such listing is neither necessary nor advisable;
 
(b) the completion of any registration or other qualification of the offer or sale of the Plan Shares under any federal or state law or under the rulings or regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other governmental regulatory body that the Committee shall in its sole discretion deem necessary or advisable; and
 
(c) the obtaining of any approval or other clearance from any federal or state governmental agency that the Committee shall in its sole discretion determine to be necessary or advisable.
 
1.9 During the term of the Plan, the Company shall at all times reserve and keep available such number of shares of Common Stock as shall be necessary to satisfy the requirements of the Plan as to the number of Plan Shares. In addition, the Company shall from time to time, as is necessary to accomplish the purposes of the Plan, seek or obtain from any regulatory agency having jurisdiction any requisite authority that is necessary to issue Plan Shares hereunder. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory agency having jurisdiction the authority deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance of any Plan Shares shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the nonissuance of Plan Shares as to which the requisite authority shall not have been obtained.
Reservation of Shares of Common Stock.
 
1.10
Tax Withholding and Reporting.
 
(a) The issuance of Plan Shares pursuant to the exercise of any Option or Stock Appreciation Right or in connection with a Performance Award, and the vesting of any Restricted Stock or Stock Unit Award, is subject to the condition that if at any time the Committee shall determine, in its discretion, that the satisfaction of
Condition Precedent.
 
withholding tax or other withholding liabilities under any federal, state, or local law is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with such issuance, vesting or payment, then the issuance, vesting or payment shall not be effected unless the withholding shall have been effected or obtained in a manner acceptable to the Committee.
 
(b) When the Committee requires an Awardee to pay to the Company an amount required to be withheld under applicable income tax laws in connection with paragraph (a) above, such payment shall be made, as the Committee may in each case in its discretion determine, (i) in cash, (ii) by check, (iii) by delivery to the Company of shares of Common Stock already owned by the Awardee having a Fair Market Value on the Tax Date equal to the amount required to be withheld, (iv) through the withholding by the Company ("Company Withholding") of a portion (but no more than the portion as so calculated) of the Plan Shares acquired upon the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right having a Fair Market Value on the Tax Date equal to the amount required to be withheld, or (v) in any other form of valid consideration permitted by the Committee in its discretion.
Manner of Satisfying Withholding Obligation.
 
(c) The Company may require as a condition to the issuance of Plan Shares covered by any Incentive Stock Option that the party exercising the Option give a written representation to the Company, satisfactory in form and substance to its counsel and upon which the Company may reasonably rely, that he shall report to the Company any disposition of such shares prior to the expiration of the holding periods specified by Section 422(a)(l) of the Code. If and to the extent the realization of income in such a disposition imposes upon the Company federal, state, or local withholding tax requirements or any such withholding is required to secure for the Company an otherwise available tax deduction, the Company shall have the right to require that the recipient remit to the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy those requirements; and the Company may require as a condition to the issuance of Plan Shares covered by an Incentive Stock Option that the party exercising such Option give a satisfactory written representation promising to make such a remittance.
Notice of Disposition of Stock Acquired Pursuant to Incentive Stock
Options.
 
(d) The Company shall file, and shall furnish the Awardee a copy of, all federal, state, and local tax information returns that it deems to be required in connection with the grant, exercise, or vesting of any Award.
Tax Reporting.
 
1.11
Exercise of Options.
 
(a) Each Option shall be exercisable in accordance with the terms of the Option Agreement pursuant to which the Option was granted. No Option may be exercised for a fraction of a Plan Share.
Method of Exercise.
 
(b) The purchase price of any Plan Shares purchased pursuant to an Option shall be paid at the time of exercise of the Option, as the Committee may in each case in its discretion determine, (i) in cash, (ii) by certified or
Payment of Purchase Price.
 
cashier's check, (iii) in shares of Common Stock held for at least six months, (iv) by delivery of a copy of irrevocable instructions from the Optionee to a broker or dealer, reasonably acceptable to the Company, to sell certain of the Plan Shares purchased upon exercise of the Option or to pledge them as collateral for a loan and promptly to deliver to the Company the amount of sale or loan proceeds necessary to pay such purchase price or (v) in any other form of valid consideration permitted by the Committee in its discretion. If any portion of the purchase price or a note given at the time of exercise is paid in shares of Common Stock, those shares shall be valued at their then Fair Market Value.
 
1.12 The Committee may accelerate the exercisability or other vesting of any Award in whole or in part at any time. Notwithstanding the provisions of any Award Agreement, the following provisions shall apply:
Acceleration in Certain Events.
 
(a) In the event that the Company, pursuant to action by the Board, at any time enters an agreement whereby the Company will merge into, consolidate with, or sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets to another corporation or other entity and provision is not made pursuant to the terms of such transaction for the assumption by the surviving, resulting, or acquiring corporation or other entity of outstanding Awards, or for the substitution of new Awards with substantially equivalent benefit therefor, each outstanding Award shall become fully (100 percent) vested upon approval of the merger or consolidation by the shareholders or owners of all constituent entities as required by the applicable laws of their respective domiciles. The Committee shall advise each Awardee in writing of the manner and terms under which such fully vested Awards shall be exercised, if applicable.
Mergers, Consolidation, Etc.
 
(b) Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, (1) an Awardee shall become fully (100 percent) vested in each of his or her Awards upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined below) or a threatened Change in Control (as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion); and (2) no Award held by an Awardee at the time a Change in Control or threatened Change in Control occurs or at any time thereafter shall terminate for any reason before the end of the Award's express term. For purposes of this section, "Change in Control" means one or more of the following events:
Change in Control.
 
(i) Any person within the meaning of Section 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act, other than the Company (including its Subsidiaries, directors or executive officers) has become the beneficial owner, within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, of 50 percent or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding Common Stock and any other class or classes of the Company's outstanding securities ordinarily entitled to vote in elections of directors (collectively, "Voting Securities") (other than through the purchase of Voting Securities from the Company); or
 
(ii) Shares representing 50 percent or more of the combined voting power of the Company's Voting Securities are purchased pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer (other than an offer by the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates); or

In the event an Awardee ceases to serve as an Employee or Director due to death, Permanent Disability, Retirement, or Cause or pursuant to a right of termination under an Employee's employment agreement with the Company, (i) the Committee shall have the ability to accelerate the vesting of the Awardee's Awards, in its sole discretion, and (ii) the Awardee's Options or Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised as follows:
Rights of Awardees Upon Termination of Employment or Service.
 
(a)Except as otherwise limited by the Committee at the time of the grant of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, if an Awardee dies while serving as an Employee or Director or within three months after ceasing to be an Employee or Director, his Options and/or Stock Appreciation Rights shall become fully (100 percent) vested on the date of his death and shall expire twelve months thereafter, unless by their terms they expire sooner or unless, with respect to a Nonqualified Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right, the Committee agrees, in its sole discretion, to extend its term further; provided, however, that the term of any such Nonqualified Stock Option shall not be extended beyond its initial term. During such period, the Option or Stock Appreciation Right may be fully exercised, to the extent that it remains unexercised on the date of death, by the Awardee's personal representative or by the distributees to whom the Awardee's rights under the Option or Stock Appreciation Right pass by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
Death.
 
(b) If an Awardee ceases to serve as an Employee or Director as a result of Retirement, (i) the Committee shall have the ability to accelerate the vesting of the Awardee's Awards, in its sole discretion, and (ii) the Awardee's Options and/or Stock Appreciation Rights shall be exercisable (to the extent exercisable on the effective date of such Retirement or, if the vesting of such Options and/or Stock Appreciation Rights has been accelerated, to the extent exercisable following such acceleration) only at any time within three months after the effective date of such Retirement, unless by their terms the Options and/or Stock Appreciation Rights expire earlier or unless, with respect to a Nonqualified Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right, the Committee agrees, in its sole discretion, to extend its term further; provided that the term of any such Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall not be extended beyond its initial term.
Retirement.
 
(c) If an Awardee ceases to serve as an Employee or Director as a result of Permanent Disability, the Awardee's Awards shall become fully (100 percent) vested and shall expire twelve months thereafter, unless by their terms they expire sooner or, unless, with respect to a Nonqualified Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right, the Committee agrees, in its sole discretion, to extend its term; provided, however, that the term of any such Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall not be extended beyond its initial term.
Disability.
 
(d)If an Awardee ceases to be employed by the Company or a Subsidiary or ceases to serve as a Director because the Awardee's employment or service relationship with the Company or a Subsidiary is terminated for Cause, the Awardee's Awards (other than Restricted Stock or Stock Unit Award that has already vested), and any rights related thereto, shall automatically expire on the date of such termination. If any facts that would constitute Cause for termination or removal of an Awardee are discovered after the Awardee's employment or service relationship with the Company has ended, any Awards then held by the Awardee (other than Restricted Stock or Stock Unit Award that has already vested) may be immediately terminated by the Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Awardee is an Employee employed pursuant to a written employment agreement with the Company or a Subsidiary, the Awardee's relationship with the Company or a Subsidiary shall be deemed terminated for Cause for purposes of the Plan only if the Awardee is considered under the circumstances to have been terminated "for cause" for purposes of such written agreement or the Awardee voluntarily ceases to be an Employee in breach of his employment agreement with the Company or a Subsidiary.
Cause.
 
(e) an Awardee's employment agreement with the Company or an Affiliate is terminated by either the Company, an Affiliate, or the Awardee by providing a required or permitted notice of termination thereunder, the Awards that are exercisable as of the date of termination shall remain exercisable for a period of twelve months (three months if Incentive Stock Options) after the date of termination and shall expire at the end of such twelve-month period (three-month period if Incentive Stock Options).
Notice. If
 
1.17 Except as may be agreed upon by the Committee in accordance with this section, Awards (other than Restricted Stock or Stock Unit Award that has fully vested) shall not be transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution or, with respect to Nonqualified Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, pursuant to the terms of a qualified domestic relations order as defined by the Code or Title I of ERISA, or the rules thereunder. Incentive Stock Options may be exercised during the lifetime of an Optionee only by that Optionee or by his legally authorized representative. The designation by an Awardee of a beneficiary shall not constitute a transfer of the Award. The Committee may, in its discretion, provide in an Award Agreement that Nonqualified Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights may be transferred to members of the Awardee's immediate family, trusts for the benefit of the Awardee and/or such immediate family members, and partnerships in which the Awardee and/or such immediate family members are the only partners, provided that there is no consideration for the transfer.
Transferability of Awards.
 
1.18 The Company shall furnish to each Awardee a copy of the annual report, proxy statements and all other reports sent to the Company's shareholders, unless the Awardee otherwise receives the same as a shareholder of the Company.

The provisions of this Article XI apply, to the extent specified in the applicable Award Agreement, to Awards granted to "covered individuals" within the meaning of Code Section 162(m) and to individuals who the Committee determines may be "covered individuals" at the time of payment of an Award. In the event of any inconsistencies between this Article XI and the other Plan provisions, the provisions of this Article XI shall control.
Applicability
 
11.2 Awards, other than Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, shall be based on the attainment of certain performance goals. No later than the earlier of (i) ninety (90) days after the commencement of the applicable fiscal year or such other award period as may be established by the Committee ("Award Period") and (ii) the completion of twenty-five percent (25%) of such Award Period, the Committee shall establish, in writing, the performance goals applicable to each such Award. At the time the performance goals are established by the Committee, their outcome must be substantially uncertain. In addition, the performance goal must state, in terms of an objective formula or standard, the method for computing the amount of compensation payable to the Awardee if the goal is obtained. Such formula or standard shall be sufficiently objective so that a third party with knowledge of the relevant performance results could calculate the amount to be paid to the subject Awardee. The material terms of the performance goals for Awardees and the compensation payable thereunder shall be submitted to the Shareholders for their review and approval if and to the extent required for such compensation to be deductible pursuant to Section 162(m) (or any successor thereto) of the Code, and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Shareholder approval, if necessary, shall be obtained for such performance goals prior to any Award being paid to such Awardee. If Shareholder approval is required and the Shareholders do not approve such performance goals, no amount shall be paid to such Awardee for such applicable Award Period under the Plan. The disclosure of the "material terms" of a performance goal and the compensation payable thereunder shall be determined under the guidelines set forth under Section 162(m) of the Code, and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

11.3 Each Award to an Awardee, other than Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, shall be based on performance goals that are sufficiently objective so that a third party having knowledge of the relevant facts could determine whether the goal was met. Except as provided in Section 11.8 hereof, performance measures that may serve as determinants of Awards shall be limited to the following measures: [earnings per share; return on assets; return on equity; return on capital; net profit after taxes; net profit before taxes; economic value added; operating profits; stock price; market share; and sales or expenses.] Within ninety (90) days following the end of each Award Period, the Committee shall certify in writing that the performance goals, and any other material terms were satisfied. Thereafter, Awards shall be made for each Awardee as determined by the Committee. The Awards may not vary from the pre-established amount based on the level of achievement.
Components of Awards
.
 
11.4 Except as provided in Sections 11.8 and 11.9 hereof, each Award, other than Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, shall be based exclusively on the performance measures established by the Committee pursuant to Sections 11.2 and 11.3.
No Mid-Year Change in Awards
.
 
11.5 An Awardee who becomes eligible to participate in the Plan after performance goals have been established in an Award Period pursuant to Sections 11.2 and 11.3 may not participate in the Plan prior to the next succeeding Award Period, except with respect to Awards that are Options or Stock Appreciation Rights.
No Partial Award Period Participation.
 
11.6 Except as provided in Section 11.8 hereof, performance goals shall not be changed following their establishment, and Awardees shall not receive any payout, except with respect to Awards that are Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, when the minimum performance goals are not met or exceeded.
Performance Goals.
 
11.7 Except as provided in Section 11.8 hereof, subjective evaluations of individual performance of the Awardees shall not be reflected in their Awards, other than Awards that are Options or Stock Appreciation Rights. The payment of such Awards shall be entirely dependent upon the attainment of the pre-established performance goals.
Individual Performance and Discretionary Adjustments.
 
11.8 No amendment of the Plan with respect to any Awardee may be made that would (i) increase the maximum amount that can be paid to any one Optionee under the Plan, (ii) change the specified performance goal for payment of Awards, or (iii) modify the requirements as to eligibility for participation in the Plan, unless the Shareholders have first approved such amendment in a manner that would permit the deduction under Section 162(m) of the Code of such payment in the fiscal year it is paid. The Committee may amend this Article XI and such other provisions as it deems appropriate, to cause amounts payable to Awardees to satisfy the requirements of Section 162(m) and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.
Amendments.
 
11.9 Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan (including the provisions of this Article XI) to the contrary, the amount of compensation that an Awardee may receive with respect to Options and Stock Appreciation Rights that are granted hereunder shall be based solely on an increase in the value of the applicable shares of Common Stock after the date of grant of such Award. Thus, no Option may be granted hereunder to an Awardee with an exercise price less than the Fair Market Value of the subject shares of Common Stock on the date of grant. The maximum amount of compensation payable as an Award (other than an Award that is an Option or Stock Appreciation Right) to any Awardee during any calendar year may not exceed $1,000,000. Section 1.6 sets forth the maximum number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which Options or Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted to any Awardee during any calendar year.

ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
Attached is Exhibit 99.1, AZZ incorporated's Press Release reporting the Company's unaudited earnings and other selected financial information for the three and six month periods ended August 31, 2005, dated October 17, 2005.

The guidance for the fiscal year to end February 28, 2006, consists of either a projected range or management's estimate of most likely results. These projections involve risk and uncertainties, the outcome of which cannot be foreseen at this time and, therefore, actual results will vary from these forecasts.
 
ITEM 9.01 EXHIBITS
 
The following exhibits are filed as part of this report.
 
 
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
Except for the statements of historical fact, this report may contain "forward-looking statements" that involve risks and uncertainties that are detailed from time to time in documents filed by the Company with the SEC. Those risks, uncertainties, and factors include, but are not limited to: change in demand, prices and raw material cost, including zinc which is used in the hot dip galvanizing process; changes in the economic conditions of the various markets the Company serves, foreign and domestic, acquisition opportunities, adequacy of financing, and availability of experienced management employees to implement the Company's growth strategy; and customer demand and response to products and services offered by the Company. The Company can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.
SIGNATURES
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
October 17, 2005  - AZZ incorporated (NYSE:AZZ), a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services today announced unaudited financial results for the three and six-month periods ended August 31, 2005. Revenues for the second quarter increased 31 percent to $47.8 million, compared to $36.5 million for the comparable period last year. Net income for the second quarter increased to $1.4 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, compared to net income of $0.9 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, in last year's fiscal second quarter.
FORT WORTH, TX
 
For the six-month period, the Company reported revenues of $92.6 million, an increase of 21 percent compared to $76.2 million for the comparable period last year. Net income for the six months rose 63% to $3.5 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, compared to $2.2 million, or $0.39 per diluted share for the comparable six-month period last year.
 
Backlog at the end of the second quarter was $76.6 million versus $53.8 million at August 31, 2004, an increase of 42%. Backlog at our February 28, 2005 year-end and the first quarter of fiscal 2006 was $64.8 million and $65.0 million respectively. Incoming orders for the second quarter totaled $59.4 million while shipments totaled $47.8 million resulting in a book to ship ratio of 124 percent. Incoming orders increased 55 percent when compared to the same period a year ago, and increased 32 percent over the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Incoming orders for the six-month period were $104.4 million, an increase of 36 percent over the same period last year, while shipments totaled $ 92.6 million, resulting in a year-to-date book to ship ratio of 113 percent.
 
Outstanding debt at the end of the quarter was $26.6 million, down 7 percent from the comparable period last year. AZZ's long-term debt to equity ratio is now .26 to 1. Combined implementation cost associated with the installation of our new ERP system and compliance cost associated with Sarbanes Oxley, totaling $775,000, is included in Selling, General and Administrative expense for the six-month period ending August 31, 2005, as compared to $399,000 for the same period in the prior year.
AZZ Second Quarter - Fiscal Year 2006
October 17, 2005

Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment increased 38 percent to $32.2 million for the second quarter, compared to $23.4 million in the previous year's second quarter. Operating income for this segment was $2.3 million, compared to $1.3 million in the second quarter of last year, an increase of 73 percent. For the first six months, revenues were $61.0 million and operating income was $4.4 million compared to $51.0 and $ 3.2 million, respectively, for the first six months of the prior year.
 
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of AZZ incorporated, commented, "Quotation activity and incoming orders in our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment were at an improved level, both domestically and internationally. Competitive pricing pressures continued and some opportunities were lost due to pricing being below our acceptable minimum margin level. Additionally, although our margins increased over last year, margins continued to be adversely impacted by our inability to pass along many of the material cost increases we have incurred since 2003, due again to competitive pricing levels. We saw a continuation of improved international quotations and were able to close a high voltage transmission order for China in the second quarter, which favorably impacted our backlog. It appears that the finalization of the energy legislation is having a positive impact on release and announcement of projects. Fixed cost leverage has improved earnings due to our prior cost reduction efforts and improved pricing levels. Two of our electrical and industrial product facilities sustained minor damage and business interruption during the recent hurricanes along the gulf coast. While customer spending will probably be increased in the future, we do not anticipate a significant impact on our business levels either favorably or unfavorably on this segment of our business for the balance of this fiscal year as a result of the hurricanes."
 
Revenues for the Company's Galvanizing Service Segment increased 19 percent to $15.6 million for the second quarter, compared to $13.1 million in the previous year's comparable quarter. Operating income for this Segment was $2.7 million, compared to $2.4 million in the same quarter last year. For the first six months of fiscal 2006, revenues were $31.5 million, and operating income was $6.4 million, compared to $25.2 and $4.7 million, respectively, for the first six months of the prior year.
 
Mr. Dingus continued, "While the results for this segment were below the record setting level of the first quarter of fiscal 2006, it was another solid quarterly performance for galvanizing. The second quarter reflects higher zinc and natural gas cost, when compared to the first quarter. Tonnage shipped was essentially unchanged from the first quarter of fiscal 2006, but was up some 15 percent over the same period last year. Due to the majority of our facilities being in the gulf coast region, we have seen firsthand the damage and destruction done to the area, and we certainly extend to all those personally impacted our greatest sympathies and prayers. We also deeply appreciate the efforts of our employees who not only contributed monetarily but also volunteered to assist those in need. It is anticipated that our third quarter and to a lesser extent our fourth quarter will be adversely impacted from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. It is difficult to determine the exact impact this will have on our customers. Due to the fact that offshore rigs and platforms and Coastal industrial installations are a very extensive user of galvanizing services, we do anticipate increased demand late in fiscal 2006 and should continue into fiscal 2007 as the area rebuilds and replaces the heavily damaged infrastructure and repairs and modifies local industrial complexes. The increased cost of energy is anticipated to adversely impact our operating results for the balance of the current fiscal year. As we review the status of all our markets, and the overall economy, we are concerned as to what the impact of the extremely high energy cost and the potential reduction in growth rate of the economy will be."

Mr. Dingus concluded, "Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are continuing our previously issued guidance for fiscal year 2006. Our earnings are estimated to be within the range of $1.08 and $1.18 per diluted share and revenues to be within the range of $170 to $180 million. Our earnings per share estimate includes the anticipated cost of completion of our Oracle ERP system implementation and Sarbanes-Oxley compliance cost totaling $1.4 million, which compares to an actual expense of $775,000 for fiscal 2006. Operating efficiency improvement, cost containment, cost escalation recovery through pricing actions, expansion of domestic and international served markets, and seeking out new product opportunities to further enhance our strategic position, continues to be the focus and emphasis of our activities."

January 6, 2006   AZZ incorporated (NYSE:AZZ), a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services today announced unaudited financial results for the three and nine-month periods ended November 30, 2005. Revenues for the third quarter increased 16 percent to $44.3 million, compared to $38.3 million for the comparable period last year. Net income for the third quarter increased to $1.7 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.2 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, in last year's fiscal third quarter.
FORT WORTH, TX
 
For the nine-month period, the Company reported revenues of $136.9 million, an increase of 20 percent compared to $114.5 million for the comparable period last year. Net income for the nine months rose 56 percent to $5.2 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, compared to $3.4 million, or $0.61 per diluted share for the comparable nine-month period last year.
 
Backlog at the end of the third quarter was $83.1 million, compared to $ 76.6 million at the end of our second quarter and $60.1 million for the comparable period last year. Incoming orders for the third quarter totaled $50.9 million while shipments for the quarter totaled $44.3 million, resulting in a book to ship ratio of 115 percent. Incoming orders for the nine-month period were $155.3 million, while year to date shipments totaled $136.9 million, resulting in a book to ship ratio of 113 percent.
 
Outstanding debt at the end of the quarter was $23.3 million, down 16 percent from the same period last year, resulting in a long-term debt to equity ratio of .21 to 1.
 
Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment increased 15 percent to $28.8 million for the third quarter, compared to $25.0 million in the previous year's third quarter. Operating income for this segment was $2.7 million a 56 percent increase when compared to $1.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. For the first nine months of fiscal 2006, revenues were $89.8 million and operating income was $7.1 million compared to $76.0 and $ 5.0 million, respectively, for the first nine months of the prior year, an 18 and 42 percent increase, respectively.
 
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of AZZ incorporated, commented, "The improved quotation, incoming orders and shipment levels continued in the third quarter of our
EX 99.1
 
current fiscal year. While the third quarter did not include any unusually large international or domestic orders, we continued to see our book to ship ratio well in excess of 1 to 1. While we have seen improved pricing levels, they are still below full recovery of material cost increases incurred over the past eighteen months. Competitive pricing pressures continue as our industry still operates with a significant level of unused capacity. We are continuing our strategy of targeted margin level pricing by market segment and product, and we will continue our effort to lower our internal cost structure, and broaden our served markets. We are extremely pleased that our operating income growth continues to exceed our revenue growth, due to continued efforts to improve price realization and the leverage gained from a lower fixed cost structure."
 
Revenues for the Company's Galvanizing Service Segment were $15.5 million for the third quarter, compared to $13.3 million in the previous year's comparable quarter. Operating income for the Segment was $2.8 million compared to $2.4 million in the same quarter last year. For the first nine months of fiscal 2006, revenues were $47.1 million, and operating income was $9.2 million compared to $38.5 million and $7.1 million, respectively, for the first nine months of the prior year. This represents a revenue increase of 22 percent and an operating income increase of 29 percent.
 
Mr. Dingus continued, "The anticipated adverse impact on our volumes due to the gulf coast hurricanes did not materialize. Despite the loss of production days, our volumes in the third quarter were consistent with those achieved in the second quarter. We anticipate that the fourth quarter will be at levels that approximate those of the second and third, and the next level of increased work associated with the Gulf Coast rebuilding effort is expected to occur in the second quarter of our fiscal 2007. Zinc and natural gas costs continue to be extremely volatile and continue to increase, making it a challenging environment to match our pricing and cost in order to sustain our excellent margin performance. This is a major concern to us for the upcoming quarter and the new fiscal year as we still face competitive pricing pressures despite the improved market conditions."
 
Mr. Dingus concluded, "On a year to date basis, our revenues and income are improving at a rate that exceeded our original internal targets and previously issued guidance. As a result of this, combined with the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are increasing our estimate of FY2006 earnings to be within the range of $1.20 to $1.30 per diluted share and revenues to be within the range of $180 to $190 million. Our earnings per share estimate includes the $1.4 million combined anticipated cost of completing of our Oracle ERP system implementation and Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, which compares to an actual expense of $775,000 for these items in fiscal 2005. Achievement of results within this range would result in solid double-digit growth for revenues and earnings for fiscal 2006, when compared to fiscal 2005."

AZZ Year-End 2006 Financial Results

April 7, 2006  - AZZ incorporated (NYSE:AZZ), a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services today announced unaudited financial results for the three and twelve-month periods ended February 28, 2006. Revenues for the fourth quarter increased 33 percent to $50.3 million, compared to $37.9 million for the comparable period last year. Net income rose 78 percent to $2.6 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.5 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, in last year's fiscal fourth quarter.
FORT WORTH, TX
Backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $73.8 million, compared to $83.1 million at the end of the previous quarter and $64.8 million for the fourth quarter of last year. Incoming orders for the fourth quarter totaled $40.9 million while shipments for the quarter totaled $50.3 million, resulting in a book to ship ratio of 81 percent for the quarter.
For the fiscal year revenues increased 23 percent to $187.2 million, compared to $152.4 million for the comparable period last year. Net income for the year was up 63 percent to $7.8 million, or $1.38 per diluted share, compared to $4.8 million, or $0.87 per diluted share for the comparable twelve-month period last year. Incoming orders for the twelve-month period were $196.2 million, while year to date shipments totaled $187.2 million, resulting in a book to ship ratio of 105 percent.
Outstanding debt at the end of the fiscal year was $19.9 million, down 32 percent from the same period last year, resulting in a long-term debt to equity ratio of .16 to 1.
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of AZZ incorporated, commented, "We are pleased to again report strong double digit improvement in our revenues, net income, fully diluted earnings per share and backlog for the fiscal year. The revenue and earnings results for fiscal 2006 exceeded our previously issued guidance. We were fortunate that customer scheduled shipment dates were maintained, and in some cases expedited. The fourth quarter was also favorably impacted by several quick turn jobs and increased demand for our hot dip galvanizing services. Fiscal 2006 was a year of improved market conditions, which facilitated our aggressive pricing and minimum margin strategies. We did see some reduction in the

number of new electrical quotations, primarily to our utility customers in the fourth quarter. It is difficult at this time to determine if this is a trend or seasonal. However the dollar value of the outstanding quotes did increase over the previous quarter due primarily to several large international quotations. Since the end of the fiscal year, we have seen an improved level of bookings. We were able to close a large high voltage transmission order for the Middle East in the month of March, which has very favorably impacted our current backlog. We believe the book to ship ratio of 81 percent for the quarter was more a factor of timing of receipt of orders rather than reduced total market demand. Due to the lead times associated with the delivery of our backlog, the timing of receipt of orders is critical to our ability to minimize the fluctuation in quarterly results. Competitive pricing conditions continue and we are still experiencing significant cost increases particularly in zinc. Demand for our galvanizing services showed a double digit increase in the fourth quarter as well as for the fiscal year, and margins remained strong despite the increases in zinc cost."
Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment were $33.9 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $24.5 million in the previous year's fourth quarter, an increase of 38 percent. Operating income for this segment increased 85 percent to $4.3 million, compared to $2.3 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For the fiscal year ended February 28, 2006, revenues increased 23 percent to $123.7 million and operating income rose 56 percent to $11.4 million, which compared favorably to the $100.5 million and $7.3 million, respectively, in the prior fiscal year.
Revenues for the Company's Galvanizing Service Segment were $16.4 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $13.4 million in the previous year's comparable quarter, an increase of 22 percent. Operating income was up 44 percent to $3.5 million in the fourth quarter as compared to $2.4 million in the same quarter last year. For the fiscal year, revenues increased 22 percent to $63.4 million, and operating income rose 33 percent to $12.7 million compared to $51.9 million and $9.6 million, respectively, for the prior fiscal year.
Mr. Dingus concluded, "While we anticipate that current market demand will continue, and in some cases improve, the timing of the projects and release of orders will likely limit our ability to recognize the full benefit of this in fiscal 2007. This combined with a continuation of competitive pricing due to excess capacity and a continuing increase in commodity pricing, particularly zinc, could inhibit our growth opportunities in fiscal 2007 and keep pressure on our margins. We will continue our efforts to aggressively manage our way through these conditions in order to build upon the accomplishments of fiscal 2006. Based upon evaluation of information currently available to management, we are estimating fiscal 2007 earnings to be within the range of $1.45 to $1.55 per diluted share and revenues to be within the range of $195 to $205 million."

The failure of any Lender to make any Committed Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Committed Loan, purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c).
Obligations of Lenders Several
(e) . Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.
Funding Source
If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Committed Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations or in Swing Line Loans held by it resulting in such Lender's receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Committed Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its share thereof as provided herein, then Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Committed Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans of the other Lenders,
2.13 Sharing of Payments.
pro rata
 
or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Committed Loans and other amounts owing them, that:
provided
(a) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and
(b) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Committed Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply).
Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation.
ARTICLE III. TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY
3.01 Taxes.
(a) .

Payments Free of Taxes
(b) . Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
Payment of Other Taxes by Borrower
(c) . Borrower shall indemnify Agent, each Lender and the L/C Issuer, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid by Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to Borrower by a Lender or the L/C Issuer (with a copy to Agent), or by Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Indemnification by Borrower
(d) . As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by Borrower to a Governmental Authority, Borrower shall deliver to Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to Agent.
Evidence of Payments
 
(e) .

(f) . If Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by Borrower or with respect to which Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), that Borrower, upon the request of Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, agrees to repay the amount paid over to Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer in the event Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This subsection shall not be construed to require Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to Borrower or any other Person.
Treatment of Certain Refunds
provided
If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to Borrower through Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Committed Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies Agent and Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted and all amounts due under in accordance with the terms thereof due to such prepayment or conversion.
3.02 Illegality.
Section 3.05
If Agent determines in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan, or (c) the Eurodollar Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, Agent will promptly so notify Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.
3.03 Inability to Determine Rates.
 
3.04 Increased Costs.
(a) . If any Change in Law shall:
Increased Costs Generally
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Eurodollar Rate) or the L/C Issuer;

(iii) impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) . If any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
Capital Requirements

A certificate of a Lender or the L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Borrower shall pay such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
Certificates for Reimbursement
(d) . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's right to demand such compensation, that Borrower shall
Delay in Requests
provided
 
not be required to compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to Agent) from time to time, Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:
3.05 Compensation for Losses.
(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); or
(b) any failure by Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by Borrower;
including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing. For purposes of calculating amounts payable by Borrower to Lenders under this , each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Base Rate used in determining the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded.
Section 3.05
If any Lender requests compensation under , or Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to , or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to , then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (a) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to or , as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to , as applicable, and (b) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
Attached is Exhibit 99.2, AZZ incorporated's Press Release reporting the Company's unaudited earnings and other selected financial information for the three period ended May 31, 2006, dated June 30, 2006.
ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS
Attached is Exhibit 99.1, Unaudited Financial and Other Statistical Information, for the three month period ended May 31, 2006 and Guidance for Fiscal Year 2007, which compiles AZZ incorporated's unaudited financial and other statistical information for the three month period ended May 31, 2006 and provides forward looking guidance for the fiscal year ending February 28, 2007. The guidance for the fiscal year to end February 28, 2007, consists of either a projected range or management's estimate of most likely results. These projections involve risk and uncertainties, the outcome of which cannot be foreseen at this time and, therefore, actual results will vary from these forecasts. We undertake no obligation to affirm, publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of information, future events or otherwise.
ITEM 9.01 EXHIBITS
The following exhibits are filed as part of this report.
 
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
Except for the statements of historical fact, this report may contain "forward-looking statements" that involve risks and uncertainties that are detailed from time to time in documents filed by the Company with the SEC. Those risks, uncertainties, and factors include, but are not limited to: change in demand, prices and raw material cost, including zinc which is used in the hot dip galvanizing process; changes in the economic conditions of the various markets the Company serves, foreign and domestic, acquisition opportunities, adequacy of financing, and availability of experienced management employees to
implement the Company's growth strategy; and customer demand and response to products and services offered by the Company. The Company can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. We undertake no obligation to affirm, publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of information, future events or otherwise.
SIGNATURES
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.2
 
 - AZZ incorporated , a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services, today announced unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended May 31, 2006. Revenues for the first quarter increased 17 percent to $52.5 million compared to $44.7 million for the same quarter last year. Net income for the quarter increased to $4.1 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, compared to net income of $2.1 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, in last year's fiscal first quarter, an increase of 94 and 87 percent, respectively.
June 30, 2006
FORT WORTH, TX
(NYSE:AZZ)
Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $92.1 million versus $65.0 million at May 31, 2005, an increase of 42 percent. Backlog at February 28, 2006 year-end was $73.8 million. Incoming orders for the first quarter totaled $70.8 million while shipments for the quarter totaled $52.5 million, resulting in a book to ship ratio of 135 percent. Incoming orders increased 57 percent over the same period last year and 73 percent over the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year. First quarter orders were very favorably impacted by the receipt of a large international order in the amount of $16.7 million for our high voltage equipment. Based upon current customer request dates and our production schedules, 68 percent of the backlog at May 31, 2006 is expected to ship in the current fiscal year.
Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment increased by 9 percent in the first quarter of the current fiscal year to $31.5 million compared to $28.8 million in the same period last year. Operating income for the segment increased 95 percent to $4.1 million.
Revenue for the Company's Galvanizing Service Segment for the first quarter was $20.9 million, an increase of 31 percent compared to the $16.0 million in the same period last year. Operating income improved 74 percent to $6.5 million. Revenues for the first quarter were significantly impacted by pricing actions required to offset escalating zinc cost. Of the 31 percent increase in revenues, 7 percent was attributable to volume and 24 percent attributable to price.
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of AZZ incorporated, commented, "We are pleased to report the significant double digit increases in our operating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. In the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment, we have seen a continuation of improving market demand and improved pricing. We continue our emphasis on
AZZ First Quarter  Fiscal Year 2007
June 30, 2006
Page 2
booking of business at specific targeted margin levels and pursuing all pricing actions that will recover the significant increases in the price of steel, aluminum and copper that we have incurred over the past two years. The increase in incoming orders for this Segment during the first quarter over the same period in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to strong bookings in the high voltage transmission, petroleum, and mining markets. Distribution and power generation orders were essentially flat with prior periods. Based upon announced projects and customer information, we anticipate seeing an increased quotation and order activity for power generation by the end of the current fiscal year.
The Galvanizing Services Segment achieved record setting results in the first quarter. The excellent operating results are reflective of improved market conditions and excellent price realization required to offset the increasing cost of zinc. Our results for this segment reflect our strategy to sustain margins during this period of extreme volatility in the cost of zinc. Due to our FIFO cost basis, the higher cost of zinc in the first quarter will not be recognized until subsequent quarters, so we do not believe the margins expressed as a percentage of sales are sustainable for the balance of the fiscal year. We are very pleased that to date, the markets have been strong enough to absorb this level of price increases, and we have only seen modest occurrences of using alternative corrosion methods."
Mr. Dingus concluded, "Cost escalation recovery through pricing actions, expansion of domestic and international markets, and seeking out new product opportunities to further enhance our strategic position continue to be the focus and emphasis of our activities. Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are increasing our estimate of FY2007 earnings to be within the range of $1.85 to $1.95 per diluted share and revenues to be within the range of $205 million to $215 million. At this time we anticipate that we will continue to see improved yearly results this year when compared to the prior year; however, we do not anticipate that we will continue to see the same rate of improvement that we saw in the first quarter."
AZZ incorporated will conduct a conference call to discuss financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 at 11:00 A.M. ET on Friday, June 30, 2006. Interested parties can access the conference call by dialing (877) 356-5706 or (706) 643-0580 (international). The call will be web cast via the Internet at . A replay of the call will be available for three days at (800) 642-1687 or (706) 645-9291 (international), confirmation #1791177, or for 30 days at .

Section 4- Matters Related to Accountants and Financial Statements
Item 4.01 Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
(a) On August 2, 2006, AZZ incorporated (the "Company") terminated the engagement of Ernst & Young LLP ("E&Y") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. In accordance with the terms of the Audit Committee Charter, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Audit Committee") participated in and approved the decision to terminate the engagement of E&Y.
E&Y's reports on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the years ended February 28, 2006 and February 28, 2005 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principle.
During the years ended February 28, 2006 and February 28, 2005 and through August 2, 2006, there were no disagreements with E&Y on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of E&Y would have caused it to make reference thereto in connection with its reports on the financial statements for such years.
During the years ended February 28, 2006 and February 28, 2005 and through August 2, 2006, there have been no reportable events, as defined in Item 304 of Regulation S-K.
The Company has furnished a copy of this Current Report on Form 8-K to E&Y and requested that E&Y furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the Commission stating whether or not it agrees with the statements made by the Company herein in response to Item 304(a) of Regulation S-K and, if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree. A copy of such letter is attached as Exhibit 16.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
(b) On August 2, 2006, the Company engaged BDO Seidman, LLP ("BDO") as the Company's new independent registered public accounting firm to audit the Company's financial statements and to perform procedures related to the financial statements included in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the periods in the year ending February 28, 2007. In accordance with the terms of the Audit Committee Charter, the Audit Committee participated in and approved the decision to engage BDO. Prior to engaging BDO as its independent registered public accounting firm, the Company did not consult with or obtain oral or written advice from BDO regarding any of the matters described in Item 304(a)(2)(i) of Regulation S-K or Item 304(a)(2)(ii) of Regulation S-K.

SECTION 8 - OTHER EVENTS
Item 8.01 - Other Events
On August 4, 2005, AZZ incorporated (the "Company") timely submitted its annual CEO certification to the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") for the fiscal year 2005, indicating its compliance with the NYSE listing standards. However, the Company received notice on September 22, 2006 from the NYSE indicating that it omitted to state in its 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders that the Company has submitted its annual CEO certification to the NYSE, as required by the commentary to Section 303A.12(a) of the NYSE listed Company Manual.
The Company does not believe that the above-referenced omission is material and is curing its non-compliance by filing this Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. To the extent required, the Company will include this disclosure in future annual reports.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

FORT WORTH, TX
For the six-month period, the Company reported revenues of $115.3 million, an increase of 25 percent compared to $92.6 million for the comparable period last year. Net income for the six months rose 169 percent to $9.4 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, compared to $3.5 million, or $0.63 per diluted share for the comparable six-month period last year.
Backlog at the end of the second quarter was $98.7 million versus $76.6 million at August 31, 2005, an increase of 29 percent. Backlog at our February 28, 2006 year-end and the first quarter of fiscal 2007 were $73.8 million and $92.1 million respectively. Incoming orders for the second quarter totaled $69.5 million while shipments totaled $62.9 million resulting in a book to ship ratio of 110 percent. For the first six months, orders totaled $140.2 million while shipments totaled $ 115.3 million, resulting in a year-to-date book to ship ratio of 122 percent. Incoming orders for the first six months increased 34 percent when compared to the same period a year ago.
Outstanding debt at the end of the quarter was $15.5 million, down 42 percent from the comparable period last year. AZZ's long-term debt to equity ratio is now .16 to 1. Included in Selling, General and Administrative expense for the six-month period ending August 31, 2006, are increased expenses associated with equity based compensation programs in the amount of $1.5 million, employee profit sharing expense in the amount of $.9 million, and the write off of $.3 million of costs related primarily to due diligence investigation of a potential acquisition target due to the low probability of the acquisition taking place.
AZZ Second Quarter  Fiscal Year 2007
September 29, 2006
Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment increased 13 percent to $36.5 million for the second quarter, compared to $32.2 million in the previous year's second quarter. Operating income for this segment was $5.1 million, compared to $2.3 million in the second quarter of last year, an increase of 126 percent. For the first six months, revenues increased 11 percent to $68.0 million and operating income increased 111 percent to $9.2 million compared to $61.0 and $ 4.4 million, respectively, for the first six months of the prior year.
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer, commented, "Strong demand for our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment continued in the second quarter. New orders were strong and balanced across our power generation, transmission and distribution, and industrial products. The continued strength of our markets has allowed us to increase our incoming order rate and continue our aggressive pricing programs designed to achieve improved margin levels. Combined with the strength of our markets, our performance has been enhanced by improved market coverage, and expansion of served markets, particularly international. The leverage gained from improved volumes and improved pricing have favorably impacted our operating margins. On a year to date basis, operating margins have improved to 13.6 percent from a comparable 7.2 percent in the prior year. Our domestic and international quotation and inquiry activity remains strong. Our challenge is to continue to seek out every opportunity to expand our served markets and product offerings that meet our targeted margin criteria."
Revenues for the Company's Galvanizing Service Segment increased 69 percent to $26.4 million for the second quarter, compared to $15.6 million in the previous year's comparable quarter. Operating income for this segment was $8.5 million, compared to $2.7 million in the same quarter last year, an increase of 221 percent. For the first six months of fiscal 2007, revenues increased 50 percent to $47.3 million, and operating income increased 135 percent to $15.0 million, compared to $31.5 and $6.4 million, respectively, for the first six months of the prior year. Year-to-date revenues for this segment increased 11 percent due to volume and 39 percent due to price.
Mr. Dingus continued, "We have implemented significant price increases in our Galvanizing Services Segment to recover the increased zinc cost. This action has favorably impacted our revenues and income. Strong market demand has positively impacted our ability to accomplish this. While pricing is up significantly, we are most pleased that our tonnage processed for the second quarter was 16 percent higher than in the same period last year. Year to date the increase in tons processed is 11 percent. While we have been favorably impacted by the rebuilding associated with hurricanes of last year, the largest portion of the improvement is spread across all of our served markets which are showing strong demand. We have been concerned about the increased cost of galvanizing and the impact this might have on customers selecting alternatives. To date this has been minimal and we do not anticipate this being a major factor for the balance of this fiscal year."
Mr. Dingus concluded, "Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are increasing our previously issued guidance for fiscal year 2007. Our earnings are estimated to be within the range of $2.65 and $2.75 per diluted share and revenues to be within the range of $240 to $250 million. Our estimates assume that we will not have any significant customer requested delays in the delivery of our electrical and industrial products, and that the cost of zinc will not significantly change during the balance of the fiscal year necessitating the need to adjust our pricing for galvanizing services."

8. .
Technical Arbitration
(a) In the event Wydman and AZZ are unable to agree on (i) the cost or other impact of a Change pursuant to Section 6 hereof, or (ii) the determination of whether a newly discovered Pollution Condition constitutes a Pre-existing Pollution Condition under Section 7, then Wydman and AZZ shall submit the matter to technical arbitration for determination as set forth below.

Wydman and AZZ shall initially split the cost of the single consultant, or pay the cost of their respective consultant and split the cost of the third consultant, as the case may be.
(c) Wydman and AZZ and the consultant(s) shall review the information provided by Wydman and AZZ. In the event the consultant(s) require(s) more information, Wydman shall be responsible for providing the information.

(ii) the appropriateness of the cost or other impact of a Change pursuant to Section 6.
This determination shall be final and conclusive as to matters submitted to arbitration, and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

"Not only does this represent three more operations for our network of plants, but opens up another strategic area that has the potential for additional growth and expansion. It is indeed a privilege to purchase operations that have such a rich regional heritage and one that has continued for generations. Certainly the pride and integrity with which it has been operated is consistent with the philosophy and methodology that AZZ employs in its current operations. We anticipate that it will be accretive in the first year of operation, and should add in excess of $15 million in annualized revenues. We appreciate the opportunity to continue the proud tradition of service that has been sustained by the Wydman family," stated David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of AZZ incorporated.
Witt Industries was originally founded as a steel waste receptacle company in 1887 and in 1899 secured the patent for the production of galvanized ash cans and lids. In the 1920's the company began to provide galvanizing services to outside customers, and thus launched the long-standing tradition of providing a superior level of service and support to this market area. Witt Industries, Inc. is a family owned operation and has been managed by a direct family member since its initial founding.
AZZ incorporated is a specialty electrical equipment manufacturer serving the global markets of power generation, transmission and distribution and industrial, as well as, a leading provider of hot dip galvanizing services to the steel fabrication market nationwide.

Section 7-Regulation FD
 
Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 are materials to be used by representatives of AZZ incorporated, a Texas corporation (the "Company"), in future presentations to the financial community.
Pursuant to General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.
The information contained herein is summary information that is intended to be considered in the context of our SEC filings and other public announcements that we may make, by press release or otherwise, from time to time. The Company undertakes no duty or obligation to publicly update or revise the information contained in this report, although the Company may do so from time to time as management of the Company believes is warranted. Any such updating may be made through the filing of other reports or documents with the SEC, through press releases or through other public disclosure.
In connection with such future presentations to the financial community, reconciliations between EBITDA (as defined below) and net income and between free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities are provided as follows. As used by the Company, these terms may differ from similarly captioned measures used by other companies.
"EBITDA", a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company presents EBITDA because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization, many of which present EBITDA when reporting their results. The Company also uses EBITDA for the following purposes: (1) the Company's credit agreement uses EBITDA to measure compliance with covenants, such as fixed charge coverage and debt incurrence; (2) EBITDA is also used by potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions with the Company; and (3) EBITDA is also used by the Company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (a) EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company's working capital needs, (b) EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Company's debts; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures. Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Company's performance. The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Company's GAAP results and using EBITDA only on a supplemental basis.
Free Cash Flow ("FCF"), also a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash disbursed for capital expenditures. The Company presents FCF because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization to the Company, many of which present FCF when reporting their results.
FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. These limitations include that FCF excludes significant cash flows, such as principal payments on debt. Because of these limitations, FCF should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Company's performance. The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Company's GAAP results and using FCF only on a supplemental basis.

January 5, 2007  - AZZ incorporated (NYSE:AZZ), a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services today announced unaudited financial results for the three and nine-month periods ended November 30, 2006. Revenues for the third quarter increased 47 percent to $65.4 million, compared to $44.3 million for the same period last year. Net income for the third quarter increased 203 percent to $5.3 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.7 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, in last year's fiscal third quarter.
FORT WORTH, TX
For the nine-month period, the Company reported revenues of $180.7 million, an increase of 32 percent compared to $136.9 million for the comparable period last year. Net income for the nine months rose 180 percent to $14.7 million, or $2.48 per diluted share, compared to $5.2 million, or $0.93 per diluted share for the comparable nine-month period last year.
Backlog at the end of the third quarter was $101.0 million versus $83.1 million at November 30, 2005, an increase of 22 percent. Backlog at the end of the second quarter was $98.7 million. Incoming orders for the third quarter totaled $67.7 million while shipments totaled $65.4 million resulting in a book to ship ratio of 104 percent. For the first nine months, orders totaled $207.9 million while shipments totaled $180.7 million, resulting in a year-to-date book to ship ratio of 115 percent. Incoming orders for the first nine months increased 34 percent when compared to the same period a year ago.
Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment increased 24 percent to $35.8 million for the third quarter, compared to $28.8 million in the previous year's third quarter. Operating income for this segment was $5.1 million, compared to $2.7 million in the third quarter of last year, an increase of 91 percent. For the first nine months, revenues increased 16 percent to $103.8 million and operating income increased 104 percent to $14.4 million compared to $89.8 and $ 7.1 million, respectively, for the first nine months of the prior year.
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer, commented, "The results of the third quarter for this segment closely mirror those of the excellent results of the second quarter. Strong demand for our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment continued in the third quarter. New orders continued to outpace our revenue growth and were balanced across our power

generation, transmission and distribution, and industrial products. The continued strength of our markets has allowed us to increase our incoming order rate and continue our pricing programs designed to achieve cost recovery and improved margin levels. The leverage gained from improved volumes and improved pricing, as well as strong contribution from quick turn jobs, are all reflected in our improved operating margins. Our domestic and international quotation and inquiry activity remains strong. Based upon current quotation activity, we anticipate that for the balance of the current fiscal year, new international orders for our high voltage transmission products, and domestic orders for the power generation and industrial markets, will reflect the strongest year over year growth. Our challenge is to continue to succeed in our efforts to expand our served markets and product offerings while maintaining our targeted margin levels."
Revenues for the Company's Galvanizing Services Segment increased 91 percent to $29.6 million for the third quarter, compared to $15.5 million in the previous year's comparable quarter. Operating income for this segment was $8.6 million, compared to $2.8 million in the same quarter last year, an increase of 208 percent. For the first nine months of fiscal 2007, revenues increased 63 percent to $76.9 million, and operating income increased 157 percent to $23.7 million, compared to $47.1 and $9.2 million, respectively, for the first nine months of the prior year. Year-to-date revenues for this segment increased 16 percent due to volume and 47 percent due to price.
Mr. Dingus continued, "After a period of relatively stable zinc pricing, we have recently seen another round of increases which has driven the cost of zinc to in excess of $2.00 per pound. This necessitated price increases for our galvanizing services, which we were successful in implementing. This, combined with the past significant price increases, has favorably impacted our revenues and income. Strong market demand has positively impacted our ability to accomplish this. While pricing is up significantly, we are most pleased that our tonnage processed for the third quarter reflected a strong 24 percent quarter over quarter growth. Our stated concern about the increased cost of galvanizing and the impact this might have on customers selecting alternatives has not materialized to date. We continue to closely monitor U.S. industrial market indicators to determine any impact upon our markets, which currently remain strong."
Mr. Dingus concluded, "Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are increasing our previously issued guidance for fiscal year 2007. Our earnings are estimated to be within the range of $3.15 and $3.25 per diluted share and revenues to be within the range of $250 million to $260 million. Our estimates assume that we will not have any significant customer requested delays in the delivery of our electrical and industrial products, and that the cost of zinc will not significantly change during the balance of the fiscal year necessitating the need to further adjust our pricing for galvanizing services."
AZZ incorporated will conduct a conference call to discuss financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 at 11:00 a.m. ET on January 5, 2007. Interested parties can access the call by dialing (877) 356-5706 or (706) 643-0580 (international). The call will be web cast via the Internet at . A replay of the call will be available for three days at (800) 642-1687, or (706) 645-9291 (international) confirmation #4783596, or for 30 days at .

April 10, 2007  - AZZ incorporated (NYSE:AZZ), a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services today announced unaudited financial results for the three and twelve-month periods ended February 28, 2007. Revenues for the fourth quarter increased 58 percent to $79.6 million, compared to $50.3 million for the comparable period last year. Net income rose 168 percent to $7.0 million, or $1.16 per diluted share, compared to net income of $2.6 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, in last year's fiscal fourth quarter. Earnings per share numbers are stated prior to the effect of the two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100 percent share dividend declared on April 5, 2007.
FORT WORTH, TX
Backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $120.7 million, compared to $101 million at the end of the previous quarter and $73.8 million for the fourth quarter of last year. Incoming orders for the fourth quarter totaled $99.3 million while shipments for the quarter totaled $79.6 million, resulting in a book to ship ratio of 125 percent for the quarter.
For the fiscal year revenues increased 39 percent to $260.3 million, compared to $187.2 million for the prior year. Net income for the year was up 176 percent to $21.6 million, or $3.65 per diluted share, compared to $7.8 million, or $1.38 per diluted share for the comparable twelve-month period last year. Earnings per share numbers are stated prior to the effect of the two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100 percent share dividend declared on April 5, 2007. Incoming orders for the twelve-month period were $307.2 million, while fiscal year revenues totaled $260.3 million, resulting in a book to ship ratio of 118 percent.
Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment were $46.4 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $33.9 million in the previous year's fourth quarter, an increase of 37 percent. Operating income for this segment increased 61 percent to $6.9 million, compared to $4.3 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For the fiscal year ended February 28, 2007, revenues increased 21 percent to $150.3 million and operating income rose 88 percent to $21.3 million, which compared favorably to the $123.7 million and $11.4 million, respectively, in the prior fiscal year.
 
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer, commented, "The fourth quarter results for this segment were very strong and complimented the previous three quarters, leading to a record setting performance year. Strong market demand provided opportunities to increase our incoming order rate and improve our pricing. This, combined with improved international business and the continuation of quick turn high margin jobs, led to strong volume increases and improved margin performance. Quotation activity remained at approximately the same level as we saw in the third quarter and indications are that it is continuing in the first quarter of our new fiscal year. As we said last quarter, our challenge is to continue to succeed in our efforts to expand our served markets and product offerings, while maintaining our strong operating performance."
Revenues for the Company's Galvanizing Service Segment were $33.2 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $16.4 million in the previous year's comparable quarter, an increase of 103 percent. Operating income was up 138 percent to $8.3 million in the fourth quarter as compared to $3.5 million in the same quarter last year. For the fiscal year, revenues increased 74 percent to $110.1 million, and operating income rose 152 percent to $31.9 million compared to $63.4 million and $12.7 million, respectively, for the prior fiscal year.
Mr. Dingus continued, "Strong market demand for galvanizing services continued and tons processed increased 34 percent for the quarter. Our recent acquisition accounted for approximately 58 percent of the volume increase for the fourth quarter. For the year, tons processed increased 20 percent from the prior fiscal year. Pricing levels for the fourth quarter were approximately the same as in the third quarter. As a result of the recent zinc cost decreases, we anticipate that some adjustment in our pricing levels will be required over the next few months. Because of the continued strong market conditions, we anticipate that we will be able to maintain our margin objectives for the new fiscal year."
Mr. Dingus concluded, "Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are pleased to project what we believe will be another excellent year for AZZ in Fiscal 2008, with record setting revenue projections of $275 to $285 million. Net income is projected to remain strong and is estimated to be the second best net income year in the 51 year history of the company. Our previously issued guidance of diluted earnings per share of $2.70 to $2.80 prior to the impact of the two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100 percent share dividend declared April 5, 2007 is reaffirmed. Adjusting for the two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100 percent share stock dividend, diluted earnings per share is estimated to be within the range of $1.35 and $1.40. Our estimates assume that we will see a continuation of strong domestic markets, penetration of selected international markets and reduced volatility in the cost of zinc and other key commodities, and a continuation of our improvement in market coverage and penetration."
AZZ incorporated will conduct a conference call to discuss financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2007 at 11:00 A.M. Eastern on Tuesday April 10, 2007. Interested parties can access the call at (877) 356-5706 or (706) 643-0580 (international). The call will be web cast via the Internet at .

Exhibit 99.1
 
 AZZ incorporated , a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services, today announced unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended May 31, 2007. Revenues for the first quarter increased 44 percent to $75.4 million compared to $52.5 million for the same quarter last year. Net income for the quarter was $4.1 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, compared to net income of $4.1 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, in last year's first fiscal quarter. Earnings per share numbers are stated after adjusting for the two-for-one stock split effected in the form of a 100 percent share dividend and paid on May 4, 2007.
June 29, 2007
FORT WORTH, TX
(NYSE:AZZ)
SG&A expenses significantly increased in the first quarter as compared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. This increase over the prior period is primarily related to compensation expense for stock appreciation rights that fully vested and were booked during the quarter in the amount of approximately $4.4 million or 22 cents per diluted share.
Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $144.8 million versus $92.1 million at May 31, 2006, an increase of 57 percent. Backlog at February 28, 2007 year-end was $120.7 million. Incoming orders for the first quarter totaled $99.5 million while shipments for the quarter totaled $75.4 million, resulting in a book to ship ratio of 132 percent. Incoming orders increased 41 percent over the same period last year and equaled the record setting incoming order rate of the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. Based upon current customer requested delivery dates and our production schedules, 72 percent of the backlog at May 31, 2007 is expected to ship in the current fiscal year. Of the backlog of $144.8 million, 35 percent is to be exported from the U.S.
Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment increased by 30 percent in the first quarter of the current fiscal year to $40.9 million compared to $31.5 million in the same period last year. Operating income for the segment increased 55 percent to $6.3 million. Operating margins of 15.5 percent for the first quarter compare favorably to the 13 percent in the first quarter of last year.
Revenues for the Company's Galvanizing Service Segment for the first quarter were $34.5 million, an increase of 65 percent compared to the $20.9 million in the same period last year. Operating income improved 32 percent to $8.6 million. Revenues for the first quarter continue
AZZ First Quarter  Fiscal Year 2008
June 29, 2007
Page 2
 
to be favorably impacted by pricing actions to offset increased zinc cost. Of the 65 percent increase in revenues, 28 percent was attributable to volume and 37 percent attributable to price. Our acquisition of Witt Galvanizing on November 1, 2006, accounted for 69 percent of the volume increase.
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of AZZ incorporated, commented, "Regarding our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment, we are pleased to report favorable increases in our revenues, operating margins and backlog for the first quarter of fiscal 2008. We have seen a continuation of improving market demand and improved pricing. We continue our emphasis on booking business at specific targeted margin levels and seeking out new market opportunities. While the largest increases in our incoming orders were related to our high voltage transmission products, all of our served markets reflected an increase over the same period of a year ago. Our domestic and international quotation and inquiry levels continue at an encouraging pace. The operating margin improvement is attributable to the leverage gained from increased volumes, quick turn jobs, and pricing actions.
The Galvanizing Services Segment achieved record setting revenues in the first quarter. Our operating results are reflective of strong market conditions and good price realization required to offset the increased cost of zinc. We are very pleased that the markets have been strong enough to absorb this level of price increases. The reduced volatility of zinc has not required us to significantly adjust our pricing levels from the third and fourth quarter of last year.
Mr. Dingus concluded, "Cost escalation recovery through pricing actions, expansion of domestic and international markets, and seeking out new product opportunities to further enhance our strategic position continue to be the focus and emphasis of our activities. Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are increasing our estimate of FY2008 earnings to be within the range of $1.65 to $1.75 per diluted share and revenues to be within the range of $310 million to $320 million."
AZZ incorporated will conduct a conference call to discuss financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 at 11:00 A.M. ET on Friday, June 29, 2007.

September 28, 2007  - AZZ incorporated (NYSE:AZZ), a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services today announced unaudited financial results for the three and six-month periods ended August 31, 2007. Revenues for the second quarter increased 30 percent to a record setting level of $81.6 million, compared to $62.9 million for the same period last year. Net income for the second quarter increased 54 percent to $8.1 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, compared to net income of $5.3 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, in last year's fiscal second quarter.
FORT WORTH, TX
For the six-month period, the Company reported revenues of $157 million, an increase of 36 percent compared to $115.3 million for the comparable period last year. Net income for the six months rose 30 percent to $12.3 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, compared to $9.4 million, or $0.80 per diluted share for the comparable six-month period last year.
Backlog at the end of our second quarter ending August 31, 2007, was $149.2 million versus $98.7 million at August 31, 2006, an increase of 51 percent. Backlog at our February 28, 2007 year-end and our first quarter of fiscal 2008 were $120.7 million and $144.8 million, respectively. Incoming orders for the second quarter totaled $86 million while shipments totaled $81.6 million resulting in a book to ship ratio of 105 percent. For the first six months, orders totaled $185.5 million while shipments totaled $ 157 million, resulting in a year-to-date book to ship ratio of 118 percent. Incoming orders for the first six months increased 32 percent when compared to the same period a year ago. Based upon current customer requested delivery dates and our planned production schedule, 57 percent of our backlog is expected to ship in the current fiscal year. Of our $149.2 million backlog, 29 percent is to be exported from the U.S.
Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment increased 24 percent to $45.2 million for the second quarter ending August 31, 2007, compared to $36.5 million in the previous year's second quarter. Operating income for the second quarter ending August 31, 2007, was $7.9 million, compared to $5.1 million in the second quarter of last year, an increase of 54 percent. Operating margins of 17.6 percent for the second quarter ending August 31, 2007 compare favorably to the 14.1 percent achieved in the prior year period. For the first six months, revenues increased 26 percent to $86 million and operating income increased 55 percent to $14.3 million compared to $68 and $ 9.2 million, respectively, for the first six months of the prior year.
 
 
Operating margin for the first six months was 16.6 percent which compares favorably to the 13.6 percent in the prior year period.
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer, commented, "The operating results for our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment continued at a record setting pace. Strong demand, enhanced operating efficiencies, improved pricing levels, excellent product mix, combined with the leverage gained from higher volume levels, drove margins to a most encouraging level. We continue to operate with a record backlog and are pleased with the balance between our product offerings. The power generation, transmission and distribution markets continued to expand and our industrial markets remained strong. Improved market coverage, and expansion of served markets, particularly international, remains a priority with us. The domestic and international quotation and inquiry activity continues to be good. Our challenge is to continue to seek out every opportunity to expand our served markets and increase our product offerings."
Revenues for the Company's Galvanizing Service Segment increased 38 percent to $36.5 million for the second quarter ending August 31, 2007, compared to $26.4 million in the previous year's comparable quarter. Operating income for this segment was $9.2 million, compared to $8.5 million in the same quarter last year, an increase of 8 percent. We achieved operating margins of 25.3 percent for the second quarter ending August 31, 2007 despite our higher zinc cost. Operating margins of 32.3 percent were achieved in the prior year second quarter period. For the first six months of fiscal 2008, revenues increased 50 percent to $71 million, and operating income increased 19 percent to $17.8 million, compared to $47.3 and $15 million, respectively, for the first six months of the prior year. Year-to-date revenues for this segment increased 25 percent due to volume and 25 percent due to price. Of the 25 percent volume increase, 76 percent is attributable to the acquisition of Witt Galvanizing. Operating margins for the first six month of 25.1 percent are lower than the 31.7 achieved in the prior year period due to the recognition of higher zinc cost.
Mr. Dingus continued, "Robust market demand for our galvanizing services has positively impacted our ability to maximize our operating results. While pricing is up significantly, we are most pleased that our tonnage processed continues to increase. The second quarter results reflect the expensing of higher zinc cost, yet margin remained about the 25 percent level. The recent reduction in the cost of zinc will require us to closely monitor our operations and pricing for the balance of the current fiscal year in order to maintain margin levels. The programs of providing a superior level of service and performance to our customers continue to position us for further growth and expansion of our served markets and increased market share."
Mr. Dingus concluded, "Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are increasing our previously issued guidance for fiscal year 2008. Our earnings are estimated to be within the range of $1.95 and $2.05 per diluted share and revenues to be within the range of $315 to $325 million. Our estimates assume that we will not have any significant customer requested delays in the delivery of our electrical and industrial products, and that the cost of zinc will not significantly decrease below current levels during the balance of the fiscal year, necessitating the need to adjust our pricing for our galvanizing services."

Section 7-Regulation FD
 
Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 are materials to be used by representatives of AZZ incorporated, a Texas corporation (the "Company"), in future presentations to the financial community.
Pursuant to General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.
The information contained herein is summary information that is intended to be considered in the context of our SEC filings and other public announcements that we may make, by press release or otherwise, from time to time.
The Company undertakes no duty or obligation to publicly update or revise the information contained in this report, although the Company may do so from time to time as management of the Company believes is warranted. Any such updating may be made through the filing of other reports or documents with the SEC, through press releases or through other public disclosure.
In connection with such future presentations to the financial community, reconciliations between EBITDA (as defined below) and net income and between Free Cash Flow (as define below) to cash provided by operating activities are provided as follows. As used by the Company, these terms may differ from similarly captioned measures used by other companies.
"EBITDA", a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company presents EBITDA because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization, many of which present EBITDA when reporting their results. The Company also uses EBITDA for the following purposes: (1) the Company's credit agreement uses EBITDA to measure compliance with covenants, such as fixed charge coverage and debt incurrence; (2) EBITDA is also used by potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions with the Company; and (3) EBITDA is also used by the Company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (a) EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company's working capital needs, (b) EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Company's debts; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures. Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Company's performance. The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Company's GAAP results and using EBITDA only on a supplemental basis.
Free Cash Flow ("FCF"), also a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash disbursed for capital expenditures. The Company presents FCF because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization to the Company, many of which present FCF when reporting their results.
FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. These limitations include that FCF excludes significant cash flows, such as principal payments on debt. Because of these limitations, FCF should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Company's performance. The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Company's GAAP results and using FCF only on a supplemental basis.

(c) Shares standing in the name of a receiver may be voted by the receiver, and shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted by such receiver without the transfer into the receiver's name if authority to do so has been given in an appropriate order of the court by which the receiver was appointed.
(d) A shareholder whose shares are pledged may vote the shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee, and thereafter the pledgee may vote the shares so transferred.
 
(e) Shares of the Corporation's stock either (i) owned by the Corporation itself, (ii) owned by another corporation, the majority of the voting stock of which is owned or controlled by the Corporation, or (iii) held by the Corporation in a fiduciary capacity shall not be voted, directly or indirectly, at any meeting, and shall not be counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time.
. (a) The Board may fix in advance a record date for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the shareholders, the record date to be not less than ten nor more than 60 days prior to the meeting, or the Board may close the stock transfer books for such purpose for a period of not less than ten nor more than 60 days prior to such meeting.
Section 2.12. Record Date; Closing Transfer Books
(b) In the absence of action by the Board fixing a record date, the date upon which the notice of the meeting is mailed shall be the record date for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting.
. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by the Board of Directors, which may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not, by law, the Articles or these Bylaws, required to be exercised or done by the shareholders.
Section 3.01. Management
. (a) Subject to Section 3.02(b), the Board of Directors shall consist of nine Directors, none of whom need be shareholders of the Corporation or residents of the State of Texas. The Directors shall be divided into three classes consisting of three Directors each. At each annual shareholders meeting, Directors shall be elected for the class whose term of office expires at that meeting, and the Directors so elected shall hold office until the third succeeding annual shareholders meeting after their election and until their successors are elected and qualified.
Section 3.02. Number; Qualification; Election; Term
(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of Section 3.02, two Directors in addition to the nine provided by subsection (a) shall serve from (date of adoption of this amendment to the Bylaws) to the 2004 annual shareholders' meeting. Commencing at the 2004 annual shareholders' meeting, the Board of Directors shall consist of twelve directors, none of whom need be shareholders of the Corporation or residents of any particular state. The Directors shall be divided into three classes consisting of four Directors each. The term of the three Directors serving as such on (date of adoption of this amendment to the Bylaws) who were elected at the 2001 annual shareholders' meeting shall continue until the Company's 2004 annual meeting. The term of the three Directors serving as such on (date of adoption of this amendment to the Bylaws) who were elected at the Company's 2002 annual shareholders' meeting shall continue until the Company's 2005 annual shareholders' meeting. The term of the three Directors serving as such on (date of adoption of this amendment to the Bylaws) who were elected at the Company's 2003 annual shareholders' meeting shall continue until the 2006 annual shareholders' meeting. At the Company's 2004 annual shareholders' meeting (i) four Directors shall be elected to serve for a term of three years until the 2007 annual shareholders' meeting (ii) one Director shall be elected to serve for a term of two years
 
until the 2006 annual shareholders' meeting and (iii) one Director shall be elected to serve for a term of one year until the 2005 annual shareholders' meeting, so that after the 2004 annual shareholders' meeting each class of Directors shall consist of four Directors. At each annual election after the 2004 annual shareholders' meeting the successors to the class of Directors whose terms expire that year shall be elected to hold office for a term of three years, so that the term of office of one class of Directors shall expire in each year.

Revenues for the third quarter increased 32 percent to $86.6 million, compared to $65.4 million for the same period last year. Net income for the third quarter increased 54 percent to $8.1 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, compared to net income of $5.2 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, in last year's fiscal third quarter.
FORT WORTH, TX
For the nine-month period, the Company reported revenues of $243.6 million, an increase of 35 percent compared to $180.7 million for the comparable period last year. Net income for the nine months rose 39 percent to $20.4 million, or $1.67 per diluted share, compared to $14.7 million, or $1.24 per diluted share for the comparable nine-month period last year.
Backlog at the end of the third quarter was $147.1 million versus $101.0 million at November 30, 2006, an increase of 46 percent. Backlog at the end of the second quarter was $149.2 million. Incoming orders for the third quarter totaled $84.5 million while shipments totaled $86.6 million resulting in a book to ship ratio of 98 percent. For the first nine months, orders totaled $270.1 million while shipments totaled $243.6 million, resulting in a year-to-date book to ship ratio of 111 percent. Incoming orders for the first nine months increased 30 percent when compared to the same period a year ago.
Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment increased 44 percent to $51.5 million for the third quarter, compared to $35.8 million in the previous year's third quarter. Operating income for this segment was $8.0 million, compared to $5.1 million in the third quarter of last year, an increase of 57 percent. For the first nine months, revenues increased 32 percent to $137.5 million and operating income increased 55 percent to $22.3 million compared to $103.8 and $ 14.4 million, respectively, for the first nine months of the prior year.
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer, commented, "The results of the third quarter for this segment closely mirror those of the excellent results of the first and second quarters. Strong demand for our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment continued in the
EX 99.1
 
third quarter. New orders were balanced across our power generation, transmission and distribution, and industrial products. As anticipated, backlog remained essentially flat with the second quarter. Absent the booking of any large international orders in the fourth quarter, the year end backlog is anticipated to remain essentially unchanged from the current levels. We are encouraged about the strength of our quotations both for the domestic and international markets and believe there are opportunities for increased bookings in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The leverage gained from improved volumes and pricing is reflected in our operating margins. Operating margins for the first nine months are 16 percent versus 14 percent for the same period last year. Our challenge is to continue to achieve growth by expanding our served markets and increasing our product offerings while maintaining our targeted margin levels."
Revenues for the Company's Galvanizing Services Segment increased 19 percent to $35.1 million for the third quarter, compared to $29.6 million in the previous year's comparable quarter. Operating income for this segment was $8.3 million, compared to $8.6 million in the same quarter last year. For the first nine months of fiscal 2008, revenues increased 38 percent to $106.1 million, and operating income increased 11 percent to $26.2 million, compared to $76.9 and $23.7 million, respectively, for the first nine months of the prior year. Year-to-date revenues for this segment increased 21 percent due to volume and 17 percent due to price. Of the 21 percent volume increase, 82 percent is attributable to acquisitions.
Mr. Dingus continued, "Strong market demand, combined with superior levels of quality and service, have continued to positively impacted our ability to maintain strong margins despite changes in the cost of zinc. We achieved excellent operating margins for the quarter of 24 percent. We are most pleased that our tonnage processed for the first nine months of the current fiscal year reflected double digit growth, and margins remained solidly ahead of historical levels. We will continue to closely monitor U.S. industrial market indicators to determine the potential impact upon our markets, which currently remain strong."
Mr. Dingus concluded, "Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are increasing our previously issued earnings guidance for fiscal year 2008. Our earnings are estimated to be within the range of $2.12 and $2.22 per diluted share. Revenues are estimated to be within the range of $315 and $325 million, which is unchanged from the previously issued guidance. Our estimates assume that we will not have any significant delays in the delivery of our electrical and industrial products, and that the cost of zinc will not significantly change from current levels during the balance of the fiscal year."

January 18, 2008 - - AZZ incorporated (NYSE: AZZ), a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services today announced revenue and earnings guidance for Fiscal Year 2009. Fiscal Year 2009 refers to the 12 month period beginning March 1, 2008 and ending on February 28, 2009.
FORT WORTH, TX
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of the company stated, "Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are pleased to project what we believe will be another record setting and excellent year for AZZ in Fiscal 2009. Our earnings are estimated to be within the range of $2.20 and $2.30 per diluted share, and revenues are estimated to be within the range of $320 to $330 million. We continue to build upon the success we have been able to achieve, and continually strive to enhance the performance of the Company. The growth that we are projecting in our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment is projected to offset the reduction that is projected in our Galvanizing Services business. This decrease is the result of lower pricing due to reduced zinc cost. Our estimates assume that we will see a continuation of strong domestic and international demand for our products and services. It is anticipated that 63 percent of our revenues will be derived from the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment and 37 percent from Galvanizing Services Segment. Margins for both Segments are projected to remain very strong, and should be in the range of 15.5 to 16.5 percent for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment and 20 to 21 percent in the Galvanizing Services Segment. We anticipate that the power generation market will approximate 14 percent, transmission and distribution 31 percent, and industrial 55 percent of fiscal 2009 revenues. Further information is provided in our 8-K filing on January 18, 2008."
Mr. Dingus continued, "Our next, regularly scheduled quarterly conference call is in April 2008, where we will be reporting the operating results for the fourth quarter and 2008 fiscal year. We are encouraged with the record setting growth and expansion of the company both in revenues and in earnings over the past few years and are continuing our efforts to seek out additional growth and expansion opportunities. The strength of our balance sheet, and in particular the continued reduction in our funded debt, fully supports this strategy."

Section 7-Regulation FD
 
Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 are materials to be used by representatives of AZZ incorporated, a Texas corporation (the "Company"), in future presentations to the financial community.
Pursuant to General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.
The information contained herein is summary information that is intended to be considered in the context of our SEC filings and other public announcements that we may make, by press release or otherwise, from time to time.
The Company undertakes no duty or obligation to publicly update or revise the information contained in this report, although the Company may do so from time to time as management of the Company believes is warranted. Any such updating may be made through the filing of other reports or documents with the SEC, through press releases or through other public disclosure.
In connection with such future presentations to the financial community, reconciliations between EBITDA (as defined below) and net income and between Free Cash Flow (as define below) to cash provided by operating activities are provided as follows. As used by the Company, these terms may differ from similarly captioned measures used by other companies.
"EBITDA", a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company presents EBITDA because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization, many of which present EBITDA when reporting their results. The Company also uses EBITDA for the following purposes: (1) the Company's credit agreement uses EBITDA to measure compliance with covenants, such as fixed charge coverage and debt incurrence; (2) EBITDA is also used by potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions with the Company; and (3) EBITDA is also used by the Company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (a) EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company's working capital needs, (b) EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Company's debts; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures. Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Company's performance. The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Company's GAAP results and using EBITDA only on a supplemental basis.
Free Cash Flow ("FCF"), also a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash disbursed for capital expenditures. The Company presents FCF because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization to the Company, many of which present FCF when reporting their results.
FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. These limitations include that FCF excludes significant cash flows, such as principal payments on debt. Because of these limitations, FCF should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Company's performance. The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Company's GAAP results and using FCF only on a supplemental basis.

Section 1-Registrant's Business and Operations
 
On March 31, 2008, AZZ incorporated (the "Company"), Arbor-Crowley, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("Subsidiary"), AAA Industries, Inc., for itself and its wholly owned subsidiaries identified in the Purchase Agreement (as defined herein) (collectively, "Seller"), and Seller's Shareholders identified in the Purchase Agreement entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which Subsidiary purchased all or substantially all of the assets of Seller (the "Asset Purchase"). The purchase price of the transaction was approximately $85,000,000, subject to adjustment as more fully described in the Purchase Agreement. The purchased assets included six galvanizing plants (three plants located in Illinois, one plant located in Indiana, one plant located in Minnesota and one plant located in Oklahoma) and related equipment and supplies.
Additionally, on March 31, 2008, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement by and among the Company and the purchasers listed on Schedule A thereto (the "Note Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company issued $100,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.24% unsecured Senior Notes due March 31, 2018 (the "Notes") (the "Note Offering"). Pursuant to the Note Agreement, the Company's payment obligations with respect to the Notes may be accelerated upon any Event of Default, as defined in the Note Agreement.
In connection with the Note Offering the Company has entered into the Second Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, (the "Second Amendment") with Bank of America, N. A. ("Bank of America"), which amends the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement Company by and among the Company, Bank of America and certain other lenders (including Bank of America) dated as of May 25, 2006 (the "Credit Agreement"). The Second Amendment contains the consent of Bank of America to the Note Offering and amends the Credit Agreement so that undertaking the Note Offering will not otherwise constitute a default under the Credit Agreement.
The summary above does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual text of each of the Purchase Agreement, the Note Purchase Agreement and the Second Amendment as filed respectively as Exhibit 10.1, Exhibit 4.1 and Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K (incorporated herein by reference).

provided
 
Each Purchaser shall have the right to substitute any one of its Affiliates as the purchaser of the Notes that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, by written notice to the Company, which notice shall be signed by both such Purchaser and such Affiliate, shall contain such Affiliate's agreement to be bound by this Agreement and shall contain a confirmation by such Affiliate of the accuracy with respect to it of the representations set forth in Section 6. Upon receipt of such
 
notice, any reference to such Purchaser in this Agreement (other than in this Section 21), shall be deemed to refer to such Affiliate in lieu of such original Purchaser. In the event that such Affiliate is so substituted as a Purchaser hereunder and such Affiliate thereafter transfers to such original Purchaser all of the Notes then held by such Affiliate, upon receipt by the Company of notice of such transfer, any reference to such Affiliate as a "Purchaser" in this Agreement (other than in this Section 21), shall no longer be deemed to refer to such Affiliate, but shall refer to such original Purchaser, and such original Purchaser shall again have all the rights of an original holder of the Notes under this Agreement.
 
. All covenants and other agreements contained in this Agreement by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns (including, without limitation, any subsequent holder of a Note) whether so expressed or not.
Section 22.1. Successors and Assigns
. Anything in this Agreement or the Notes to the contrary notwithstanding (but without limiting the requirement in Section 8.4 that the notice of any optional prepayment specify a Business Day as the date fixed for such prepayment), any payment of principal of or Make-Whole Amount or interest on any Note that is due on a date other than a Business Day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day without including the additional days elapsed in the computation of the interest payable on such next succeeding Business Day; provided that if the maturity date of any Note is a date other than a Business Day, the payment otherwise due on such maturity date shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and shall include the additional days elapsed in the computation of interest payable on such next succeeding Business Day.
Section 22.2. Payments Due on Non-Business Days
. All accounting terms used herein which are not expressly defined in this Agreement have the meanings respectively given to them in accordance with GAAP. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, (i) all computations made pursuant to this Agreement shall be made in accordance with GAAP, and (ii) all financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Section 22.3. Accounting Terms
. Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall (to the full extent permitted by law) not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
Section 22.4. Severability
. Each covenant contained herein shall be construed (absent express provision to the contrary) as being independent of each other covenant contained herein, so that compliance with any one covenant shall not (absent such an express contrary provision) be deemed to excuse compliance with any other covenant. Where any provision herein refers to action to be taken by any Person, or which such Person is prohibited from taking, such provision shall be applicable whether such action is taken directly or indirectly by such Person.
Section 22.5. Construction
 
For the avoidance of doubt, all Schedules and Exhibits attached to this Agreement shall be deemed to be a part hereof.
. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original but all of which together shall constitute one instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof, each signed by less than all, but together signed by all, of the parties hereto.
Section 22.6. Counterparts
. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and the rights of the parties shall be governed by, the law of the State of New York excluding choice-of-law principles of the law of such State that would permit the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than such State.
Section 22.7. Governing Law
. (a) The Company irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Notes. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, any claim that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Section 22.8. Jurisdiction and Process; Waiver of Jury Trial
(b) The Company consents to process being served by or on behalf of any holder of Notes in any suit, action or proceeding of the nature referred to in Section 22.8(a) by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to it at its address specified in Section 18 or at such other address of which such holder shall then have been notified pursuant to said Section. The Company agrees that such service upon receipt (i) shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon it in any such suit, action or proceeding and (ii) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be taken and held to be valid personal service upon and personal delivery to it. Notices hereunder shall be conclusively presumed received as evidenced by a delivery receipt furnished by the United States Postal Service or any reputable commercial delivery service.
(c) Nothing in this Section 22.8 shall affect the right of any holder of a Note to serve process in any manner permitted by law, or limit any right that the holders of any of the Notes may have to bring proceedings against the Company in the courts of any appropriate jurisdiction or to enforce in any lawful manner a judgment obtained in one jurisdiction in any other jurisdiction.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 - AZZ incorporated , a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services, today announced the signing of an asset purchase agreement with AAA Industries, Inc., a privately held company, to acquire substantially all of the assets related to AAA's galvanizing operations. The acquisition with a purchase price of approximately $85 million will be paid for in cash. AAA operates seven galvanizing facilities with locations in Joliet, Peoria, Dixon and Cicero Illinois, Hamilton Indiana, Winsted Minnesota and Chelsea Oklahoma. While the Cicero Illinois facility was not acquired by AZZ, it will be closed effective April 1, 2008, and the operations will be consolidated with the Joliet Illinois facility. The acquisition will compliment AZZ's previous move into this geographic territory in November of 2006 with the multi facility acquisition of Witt Galvanizing. This acquisition should provide an additional potential for continued growth and expansion of the Galvanizing Services Segment of AZZ incorporated.
April 1, 2008
FORT WORTH, TX
(NYSE:AZZ)
"This not only represents a multiple facility addition to our network of plants, but significantly strengthens our marketing and customer service opportunities in this strategic area. It is indeed a privilege to purchase operations that have such a rich regional heritage and one that has enjoyed impressive growth while providing an outstanding level of quality and customer service. Certainly the pride and integrity with which it has been operated is consistent with the philosophy and methodology that AZZ employs in its current operations. We anticipate that it will be accretive to earnings per share in the first year of operation of approximately 10 cents, and should add in excess of $50 million in revenues. The anticipated favorable impact on the outlook and guidance for Fiscal 2009 for the eleven months of the consolidated operations, combined with details of the financing arrangements will be discussed in detail during our upcoming regularly scheduled quarterly conference call on April 4, 2008. We appreciate the opportunity to continue the proud tradition of service that has been sustained by AAA founder and CEO Laxman Alreja," stated David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of AZZ incorporated.
AAA was originally founded in 1993 by Mr. Alreja with the initial facility in Joliet Illinois. Through a series of acquisitions and building of new facilities, it has grown into a dominant player in its primary served markets. It will be the intent of AZZ to service the Cicero customers from one highly efficient strategically located customer service facility in Joliet. All remaining facilities will continue to operate in the same manner as was conducted prior to the acquisition. With the addition of these facilities, the network of Galvanizing operations of AZZ will grow to 20, clearly the largest provider of after fabrication hot dip galvanizing in North America.
In conjunction with the acquisition, the Company also completed a Private Placement of 10 Year 6.24 percent unsecured Senior Notes in the amount of $100 million, the details of which have been provided in the company's Form 8-K filing with the SEC. These Senior Notes facilitated the acquisition of the AAA galvanizing operations.
AZZ incorporated is a specialty electrical equipment manufacturer serving the global markets of power generation, transmission and distribution and industrial, as well as, a leading provider of hot dip galvanizing services to the steel fabrication market nationwide.
Except for the statements of historical fact, this release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties some of which are detailed from time to time in documents filed by the Company with the SEC. Those risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: changes in customer demand and response to products and services offered by the company, including demand by the electrical power generation markets, electrical transmission and distribution markets, the industrial markets, and the hot dip galvanizing markets; prices and raw material cost, including zinc and natural gas which are used in the hot dip galvanizing process; changes in the economic conditions of the various markets the Company serves, foreign and domestic, customer request delays of shipments, acquisition opportunities, adequacy of financing, and availability of experienced management employees to implement the Company's growth strategy. The Company can give no assurance that such forward-looking statements will prove to be correct. We undertake no obligation to affirm, publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of information, future events or otherwise.

Section 7-Regulation FD
 
Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 are materials to be used by representatives of AZZ incorporated, a Texas corporation (the "Company"), in future presentations to the financial community.
Pursuant to General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.
The information contained herein is summary information that is intended to be considered in the context of our SEC filings and other public announcements that we may make, by press release or otherwise, from time to time. The Company undertakes no duty or obligation to publicly update or revise the information contained in this report, although the Company may do so from time to time as management of the Company believes is warranted. Any such updating may be made through the filing of other reports or documents with the SEC, through press releases or through other public disclosure.
In connection with such future presentations to the financial community, reconciliations between EBITDA (as defined below) and net income and between Free Cash Flow (as define below) to cash provided by operating activities are provided as follows. As used by the Company, these terms may differ from similarly captioned measures used by other companies.
"EBITDA", a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company presents EBITDA because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization, many of which present EBITDA when reporting their results. The Company also uses EBITDA for the following purposes: (1) the Company's credit agreement uses EBITDA to measure compliance with covenants, such as fixed charge coverage and debt incurrence; (2) EBITDA is also used by potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions with the Company; and (3) EBITDA is also used by the Company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (a) EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company's working capital needs, (b) EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Company's debts; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures. Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Company's performance. The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Company's GAAP results and using EBITDA only on a supplemental basis.
Free Cash Flow ("FCF"), also a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash disbursed for capital expenditures excluding acqusitions. The Company presents FCF because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization to the Company, many of which present FCF when reporting their results.
FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. These limitations include that FCF excludes significant cash flows, such as principal payments on debt. Because of these limitations, FCF should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Company's performance. The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Company's GAAP results and using FCF only on a supplemental basis.
EBITDA Reconciliation
The reconciliation of EBITDA with net income is as follows (in thousands):
 
Free Cash Flow Reconciliation
The reconciliation of cash flows provided by (used in) operations with free cash flow is as follows (in thousands):
 
Item 8.01 Other Events
Attached is Exhibit 99.2, Financial and Other Statistical Information, which contains guidance and selected financial projections for the fiscal year ending February 28, 2009. The guidance contained in the attached exhibits consists of either a projected range or management's estimate of most likely results. These projections involve risk and uncertainties, the outcome of which cannot be foreseen at this time and, therefore, actual results will vary from these forecasts. The Company undertakes no obligation to affirm publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of information, future events or otherwise.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of as of December 31, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in the shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.   Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial

statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of as of December 31, 2007, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Nature of Operations
 
AAA Galvanizing, Inc. was incorporated in Illinois on January 7, 1993. The Company's business is coating oxide free iron or steel with a thin high quality layer of zinc, by a well-established process called hot dip galvanizing. This process protects the surface against corrosion, thus extending the product life and resulting in minimal maintenance costs. On June 29, 2002, AAA Galvanizing, Inc. changed its corporate name to AAA Industries, Inc. ("AAA or the "Company").
 
On July 3, 2002, under a Bill of Sale and Assignment Agreement, the operating assets and liabilities of AAA were transferred to AAA Galvanizing of Joliet, Inc. ("Joliet"), a new company that was incorporated on July 2, 2002. After such transfer, AAA became a holding company having Joliet, AAA Galvanizing of Dixon, Inc. ("Dixon"), AAA Galvanizing of Hamilton, Indiana, Inc. ("Hamilton"), AAA Galvanizing of Peoria, Inc. ("Peoria"), and AAA Quality Galvanizing, Inc. ("Oklahoma") as its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Dixon was incorporated in Illinois on August 4, 1998. Hamilton was incorporated in Indiana on February 12, 2001 and commenced its operations in April 2002. Peoria was incorporated in Illinois on September 23, 2003 and started its operations in March 2004. Oklahoma was incorporated in Illinois and began operations in October 2006. Effective the close of business on January 2, 2007, AAA acquired Brightly Galvanizing, Inc ("Brightly") under a stock purchase agreement. In 2006, AAA incorporated the AAA Galvanizing of Minnesota to be located at Winsted, ("Winsted"). During 2007, AAA began the construction of this plant; the plant commenced operation in February 2008.
 
The consolidated financial statements of AAA for 2007 include accounts of Joliet, Dixon, Hamilton, Peoria, Oklahoma, Brightly and Winsted.
 
Principles of Consolidation
 
The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
Basis of Accounting
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting. The accrual basis recognizes revenues in the accounting period in which revenues are earned and recognizes expenses in the period in which expenses are incurred.

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
 
Accounting Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization, and sales returns. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Income Taxes
 
The Company has elected to be treated as a "small business corporation" under Section 1362 of the Internal Revenue Code for federal income tax purposes. As an S Corporation, the Company does not pay federal income tax; its income is passed to its shareholders.

NOTE 11 - CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
 
The Company is a defendant in a lawsuit filed by the estate of a former employee, who was deceased as a result of an accident at the Joliet plant on November 11, 2002. The outside counsel believes that the Company has a 75% chance to prevail in the lawsuit. In the event of an unfavorable outcome, the possible loss estimated by the counsel is in the range of $500,000 to $750,000. The Company has an insurance policy that provides coverage for such losses up to $500,000 of a primary coverage and an additional $5 million of umbrella liability coverage.

NOTE 11 - CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (Continued)
 
Although the Company is vigorously defending this action, the parties are also actively discussing potential settlement of the matter. No estimate can be made of the potential settlement.
 
Pursuant to an indemnification clause in the stock purchase agreement executed in December 2006 for the acquisition of Brightly Galvanizing, Inc., AAA deposited $250,000 of the purchase price in an escrow account, pending resolution of issues that may arise in connection with indemnity matters as indicated in Article 8 of the agreement. AAA is unaware of any indemnification matter as of December 31, 2007. Also, an escrow account for $125,000 was established under the purchase agreement to cover potential environmental remediation costs. Previously in 2005, Brightly was cited by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for violation of environmental codes. As a corrective action plan, Brightly submitted a Compliance Commitment Agreement to EPA.
 
NOTE 12 - INTANGIBLE ASSETS- GOODWILL
 
In October 2005, assets of Quality Galvanizing LLC at Chelsea, Oklahoma, were acquired. The excess of the cost of this acquisition over the fair value of the acquired net assets totaling $601,638 was reported as goodwill. The Company adopted SFAS 142 as of the acquisition date, and accordingly, did not amortize amounts related to goodwill starting from that date. Also, as a part of the purchase of Brightly Galvanizing Inc. on January 2, 2007, the Company recognized goodwill of $128,355.
 
As required by SFAS 142, goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test. The test consists of a two-step process whereby a determination is made as to whether impairment exists, and then whether an adjustment is required. No impairment loss was recognized for 2007 on the $601,638 recognized for Quality Galvanizing LLC. However, an impairment loss of $128,355, representing the goodwill reported for Brightly Galvanizing Inc. was recognized as other expense in the 2007 Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company has decided to close Brightly for operations effective March 31, 2008; a loss is anticipated on the sale of the plant.
 
NOTE 13 - SUBSEQUENT EVENT
 
Effective the close of business on March 31, 2008, AAA and its subsidiaries (Joliet, Dixon, Hamilton, Peoria, Oklahoma, Brightly and Winsted) were acquired by AZZ Incorporated ("AZZ") for $80,939,000. Under the terms of the asset purchase agreement, substantially all assets of AAA and its subsidiaries were acquired and certain liabilities were either assumed by AZZ or paid in full from the proceeds.
 
18
 
NOTE 13 - SUBSEQUENT EVENT (Continued)
 
The assets acquired included all accounts receivable, inventories, factory and office equipment, and real properties except for Brightly plant at Cicero, Illinois. An intangible asset in the form of customer list for the seven plants was also acquired.
 
On April 1, 2008, the following outstanding loans and obligations of AAA as of March 31, 2008 were paid-off:
 
During 2008, the Company paid service fee totaling $1,540,000 to Global Professional Services Group, LLC ("Global"), a firm, related to AAA. Global served as the exclusive financial advisor to the Company in connection with the sale of its assets to AZZ. Global is 100% owned by the son of AAA Chief Executive Officer and its majority shareholder.
 
On March 31, 2008, there were 13,546 outstanding common shares of AAA.  During April
2008, $35,219,600 was distributed to shareholders from the sale proceeds at the rate of $2,600 per share. The board of directors of AAA has not implemented a plan of liquation as
of March 31,2008.

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Nature of Operations
AAA Galvanizing, Inc. was incorporated in Illinois on January 7, 1993. The Company's business is coating oxide free iron or steel with a thin high quality layer of zinc, by a well-established process called hot dip galvanizing. This process protects the surface against corrosion, thus extending the product life and resulting in minimal maintenance costs. On June 29, 2002, AAA Galvanizing, Inc. changed its corporate name to AAA Industries, Inc. ("AAA or the "Company").
On July 3, 2002, under a Bill of Sale and Assignment Agreement, the operating assets and liabilities of AAA were transferred to AAA Galvanizing of Joliet, Inc. ("Joliet"), a new company that was incorporated on July 2, 2002. After such transfer, AAA became a holding company having Joliet, AAA Galvanizing of Dixon, Inc. ("Dixon"), AAA Galvanizing of Hamilton, Indiana, Inc. ("Hamilton"), AAA Galvanizing of Peoria, Inc. ("Peoria"), and AAA Quality Galvanizing, Inc. ("Oklahoma") as its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Dixon was incorporated in Illinois on August 4, 1998. Hamilton was incorporated in Indiana on February 12, 2001 and commenced its operations in April 2002. Peoria was incorporated in Illinois on September 23, 2003 and started its operations in March 2004. Oklahoma was incorporated in Illinois and began operations in October 2005.
The consolidated financial statements of AAA for 2006 and 2005 include the accounts of Joliet, Dixon, Hamilton, Peoria, and Oklahoma.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Basis of Accounting
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting. The accrual basis recognizes revenues in the accounting period in which revenues are earned and recognizes expenses in the period in which expenses are incurred.

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization, and sales returns. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Income Taxes
The Company has elected to be treated as a "small business corporation" under Section 1362 of the Internal Revenue Code for federal income tax purposes.

The Company has also elected to treat its wholly owned subsidiaries as Qualified Subchapter S Subsidiaries (QSUB).
Accounts Receivable and Related Allowance
The Company extends credit to some of its customers. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts carried at a level that, in management's judgment, is adequate to provide for estimated probable losses from uncollectible receivables. The amount of the allowance is based on management's forma! review and analysis of total receivables as of year-end. Receivables are considered past due when payment is not received within 120 days. Receivables over 120 days are $433,110 and $170,524 as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Section 7-Regulation FD
 
 
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 are materials to be used by representatives of AZZ incorporated, a Texas corporation (the Company), in future presentations to the financial community.
Pursuant to General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K, shall not be deemed to be filed for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.
The information contained herein is summary information that is intended to be considered in the context of our SEC filings and other public announcements that we may make, by press release or otherwise, from time to time.
The Company undertakes no duty or obligation to publicly update or revise the information contained in this report, although the Company may do so from time to time as management of the Company believes is warranted. Any such updating may be made through the filing of other reports or documents with the SEC, through press releases or through other public disclosure.
In connection with such future presentations to the financial community, reconciliations between EBITDA (as defined below) and net income and between Free Cash Flow (as define below) to cash provided by operating activities are provided as follows. As used by the Company, these terms may differ from similarly captioned measures used by other companies.
EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  The Company presents EBITDA because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization, many of which present EBITDA when reporting their results.  The Company also uses EBITDA for the following purposes: (1) the Companys credit agreement uses EBITDA to measure compliance with covenants, such as fixed charge coverage and debt incurrence; (2) EBITDA is also used by potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions with the Company; and (3) EBITDA is also used by the Company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  Some of these limitations are: (a) EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Companys working capital needs, (b) EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Companys debts; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures.  Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Companys performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using EBITDA only on a supplemental basis.
Free Cash Flow (FCF), also a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash disbursed for capital expenditures excluding acqusitions.  The Company presents FCF because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization to the Company, many of which present FCF when reporting their results.
FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  These limitations include that FCF excludes significant cash flows, such as principal payments on debt.  Because of these limitations, FCF should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Companys performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using FCF only on a supplemental basis.

participant's ownership of stock and/or options to purchase stock possessing 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of  the Company or any subsidiary, and to restrict a participant's right to purchase stock under the Purchase Plan to the maximum amount allowed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which is currently $25,000 in fair market value of such stock (determined at the time the option is granted), for each calendar year in which such option is outstanding at any time.  Unless the employee's participation is discontinued, his option for the purchase of shares of common stock will be exercised automatically at the end of each six month exercise period within the offering period at the applicable price.  To the extent an employee's payroll deductions exceed the amount required to purchase the shares subject to option, such excess amount shall be held in such participant's account for the next exercise period, unless such participant has withdrawn from the offering period or unless such offering period has terminated with such exercise date, in which case such amount shall be returned to the employee without interest.
Shares Available Under the Purchase Plan
The total number of shares of common stock that are issuable under the Purchase Plan is five hundred thousand (500,000) shares.
Eligibility and Participation
Any employee who is employed by the Company or its participating majority owned subsidiaries for at least twenty hours per week (customarily) and more than ninety days prior to such employees election to participate in the Purchase Plan is eligible to participate in offerings under the Purchase Plan.  Employees become participants in the Purchase Plan by delivering to the Company a subscription agreement authorizing payroll deductions within the specified period of time prior to the commencement of each offering period.  Currently, the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries have approximately 1,700 employees eligible to participate in the Purchase Plan.  The Board of Directors has the sole discretion to designate majority owned subsidiaries of the Company for participation in the Purchase Plan, and the Board of Directors may amend this designation at any time in its sole discretion.
No employee is permitted to purchase shares under the Purchase Plan if such employee owns 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of shares of stock of the Company (including shares that may be purchased under the Purchase Plan or pursuant to any other options).  In addition, no employee is entitled to purchase more than the maximum amount of shares allowed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which is currently $25,000 worth of shares (based on the fair market value of the shares at the time the option is granted) in any calendar year.
Purchase Price
The price at which shares of common stock are sold under the Purchase Plan is eighty-five percent (85%) of the fair market value per share of common stock at either the beginning of the offering period or at  the end of each six-month exercise period, whichever is lower.
Administration
The Purchase Plan is administered by the Board of Directors or a committee appointed by the Board of Directors.  Directors who are eligible employees are permitted to participate in the Purchase Plan; provided, however, that (i) directors who are eligible to participate in the Purchase Plan may not vote on any matter affecting the administration or the grant of any option pursuant to the Purchase Plan and (ii) if a committee is established to administer the Purchase Plan, no committee member will be eligible to participate in the Purchase Plan.  In the event that the shareholders approve the Purchase Plan, the Board will delegate administration of the Purchase Plan to the Compensation Committee.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
 
 
 
1.1             This Plan shall be known as the Amended and Restated AZZ incorporated 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan.  Capitalized terms used herein are defined in Article XII hereof.
Name.
1.2             The purpose of the Plan is to promote the growth and general prosperity of the Company by permitting the Company to award to its Employees and Directors shares of Common Stock of the Company and options to purchase Common Stock in the form of Incentive Stock Options, Non-qualified Stock Options, Performance Awards, Restricted Stock, Stock Appreciation Rights and Stock Unit Awards.  The Plan is designed to help the Company and its Affiliates attract and retain superior personnel for positions of substantial responsibility, to provide Employees and Directors with an additional incentive to contribute to the long-term performance and success of the Company and to align Employees and Directors long-term financial interests with those of the Companys stockholders.  The Company intends that Incentive Stock Options granted pursuant to Article III shall qualify as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code.
Purpose.
1.3             The Plan shall become effective upon the Effective Date; provided, however, that if the shareholders of the Company have not approved the Plan by the date that is twelve months after the Effective Date, the Plan and all grants made under the Plan shall be void and of no force or effect.
Effective Date.
1.4             Any Employee or Director shall be eligible to participate in the Plan.  Subject to the following provisions, the Committee may make Awards in accordance with such determinations as the Committee from time to time in its sole discretion shall make; provided, however, that Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to persons who are Employees.
Eligibility to Participate.
1.5             The shares of Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Plan shall be either authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock or shares of Common Stock issued and thereafter acquired by the Company in open market transactions or otherwise.
Shares Subject to the Plan.
1.6             Subject to adjustment pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.2, and subject to any additional restrictions elsewhere in the Plan, the maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued and sold hereunder shall not exceed 1,000,000 shares, and the maximum aggregate number of Plan Shares with respect to which Awards may be granted to any person during any calendar year shall not exceed 100,000 shares.
Maximum Number of Plan Shares.
1.7             Plan Shares with respect to which an Option has been exercised or Restricted Stock or Stock Unit Awards have vested and Plan Shares which

have been issued in connection with Performance Awards shall not again be available for grant hereunder.  If Options or Stock Appreciation Rights terminate for any reason without being wholly exercised, if Restricted Stock or Stock Unit Awards are forfeited prior to vesting or if Plan Shares are not issued under Performance Awards, the number of Plan Shares underlying such Award shall not count towards the maximum aggregate number of Plan Shares that may be issued under the Plan as set forth in Section 1.6, and new Awards may be granted hereunder covering the number of Plan Shares to which such termination, forfeiture or lapse relates.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent required for Awards intended to constitute qualified performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m) to satisfy the requirements for deductibility under Code Section 162(m), Plan Shares subject to an Option or Stock Appreciation Right that is cancelled shall not again be available under the Plan for purposes of Section 1.6 and such other purposes, if any, as are required to satisfy such requirements under Code Section 162(m).
Upon the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, only the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued in connection with the exercise of such Stock Appreciation Right (and not the corresponding number of shares of Common Stock related to the Stock Appreciation Right (or portion thereof) being exercised) shall be treated as issued under the Plan and, for the purpose of the limitation set forth in Section 1.6 of the Plan in regard to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable under the Plan, the remaining number of shares of Common Stock related to such exercised Stock Appreciation Right (or portion thereof) shall again be available for issuance under the Plan.  In the event that the Company distributes cash in lieu of issuing shares of Common Stock in connection with the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, the corresponding number of shares of Common Stock related to the Stock Appreciation Right (or portion thereof) being exercised shall again be available for issuance under the Plan.
1.8             The Company shall not issue any certificate for Plan Shares pursuant to the Plan prior to fulfillment of all of the following conditions:
Conditions Precedent.
1.9             During the term of the Plan, the Company shall at all times reserve and keep available such number of shares of Common Stock as shall be necessary to satisfy the requirements of the Plan as to the number of Plan Shares.  In addition, the Company shall from time to time, as is necessary to accomplish the purposes of the
Reservation of Shares of Common Stock.

Plan, seek or obtain from any regulatory agency having jurisdiction any requisite authority that is necessary to issue Plan Shares hereunder.  The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory agency having jurisdiction the authority deemed by the Companys counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance of any Plan Shares shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the nonissuance of Plan Shares as to which the requisite authority shall not have been obtained.

1.14             Plan Shares shall not be issued with respect to any Award unless the issuance and delivery of the Plan Shares (and the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, if applicable) shall comply with all relevant provisions of state and federal law (including without limitation (i) the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and (ii) the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the Plan Shares may then be listed) and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance. The Committee may also require an Awardee to furnish evidence satisfactory to the Company, including without limitation a written and signed representation letter and consent to be bound by any transfer restrictions imposed by law, legend, condition, or otherwise, that the Plan Shares are being acquired only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute the shares in violation of any state or federal law, rule, or regulation.  Further, each Awardee shall consent to the imposition of a legend on the certificate representing the Plan Shares issued pursuant to an Award, restricting their transfer as required by law or this section.
Compliance with Securities Laws.
1.15             Nothing in the Plan or in any Award shall confer upon any Employee any right to continued employment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Subsidiary at any time to terminate or alter the terms of that employment.  Nothing in the Plan or in any Award shall confer upon any Director any right to continued service as a Director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Subsidiary at any time to terminate or alter the terms of that service.
Employment or Service of Awardee.
1.16             The provisions in this Section 1.16 shall be subject to the provisions of Sections 6.1 and 8.1 the provisions of any Award Agreement.  In the event an Awardee ceases to be an Employee or Director, or for any reason other than death, Retirement, Permanent Disability, or Cause or pursuant to a right of termination under an Employees employment agreement with the Company, (i) the Committee shall have the ability to accelerate the vesting of the Awardees Awards, in its sole discretion, and (ii) any Option or Stock Appreciation Right held by such Awardee shall be exercisable (to the extent exercisable on the date of termination of employment or rendition of services, or, if the vesting of such Option or Stock Appreciation Right has been accelerated, to the extent exercisable following such acceleration) at any time within three months after the date of termination of employment or rendition of services, unless by its terms the Option or Stock Appreciation Right expires earlier or unless, with respect to a Nonqualified Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right, the Committee agrees, in its sole discretion, to extend its term further; provided, however, that the term of any such Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall not be extended beyond its initial term. In the event an Awardee ceases to serve as an Employee or Director due to death, Permanent Disability, Retirement, or Cause or pursuant to a right of termination under an Employees employment agreement with the Company, (i) the Committee shall have the ability to accelerate the vesting of the Awardees Awards, in its sole

Incentive Stock Options may be exercised during the lifetime of an Optionee only by that Optionee or by his legally authorized representative.  The designation by an Awardee of a beneficiary shall not constitute a transfer of the Award.  The Committee may, in its discretion, provide in an Award Agreement that Nonqualified Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights may be transferred to members of the Awardees immediate family, trusts for the benefit of the Awardee and/or such immediate family members, and partnerships in which the Awardee and/or such immediate family members are the only partners, provided that there is no consideration for the transfer.

whether Performance Awards are forfeited or vest upon termination of employment or service during a performance period and the maximum or minimum settlement values; provided, however, that Performance Awards may not fully vest in less than one year in the case of performance vesting or three years in the case of time vesting.  Each Performance Award shall have its own terms and conditions, which shall be determined at the discretion of the Committee.  If the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that the established performance measures or objectives are no longer suitable because of a change in the Company's business, operations, corporate structure or for other reasons that the Committee deems satisfactory, the Committee may modify the performance measures or objectives and/or the performance period.  Performance Awards may be valued by reference to the Fair Market Value of a share of common stock or according to any formula or method deemed appropriate by the Committee, in its sole discretion, including, but not limited to, achievement of specific financial, production, sales, cost or earnings performance objectives that the Committee believes to be relevant to the Company's business and for remaining in the employ or active service of the Company for a specified period of time, or the Company's performance or the performance of its shares of Common Stock measured against the performance of the market, the Company's industry segment or its direct competitors.  Notwithstanding anything herein or in any Award Agreement to the contrary, no participant in the Plan who is subject to United States federal income tax shall be awarded a Performance Award unless the Committee determines that such Performance Award does not provide for the deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.
8.2             Performance Awards may be paid in cash, shares of Common Stock (including Restricted Stock) or other consideration, or any combination thereof.  If payable in shares of Common Stock, the consideration for the issuance of the shares of Common Stock may be the achievement of the performance objective established at the time of the grant of the Performance Award.  Performance Awards may be payable in a single payment or in installments and may be payable at a specified date or dates or upon attaining the performance objective, all at the Committee's discretion.  The extent to which any applicable performance objective has been achieved shall be conclusively determined by the Committee.
Settlement of Performance Awards.

Plan after that date of termination.  Subject to the limitations contained in this Section, the Committee may at any time amend or revise the terms of the Plan, including the form and substance of the Award Agreements to be used in connection herewith; provided that no amendment or revision may be made without the approval of the shareholders of the Company if such approval is required under the Code, Rule 16b-3, or any other applicable law or rule or if such amendment increases the number of shares available for Awards under the Plan.  No amendment, suspension, or termination of the Plan shall, without the consent of the individual who has received an Award hereunder, alter or impair any of that individuals rights or obligations under any Award granted prior to that amendment, suspension, or termination. Notwithstanding any provision in this plan to the contrary, no option or stock appreciation right may be amended to reduce the price per share of the shares subject to such option or the exercise price of such stock appreciation right, as applicable, below the option price or exercise price as of the date the option or stock appreciation right is granted.  In addition, no option or stock appreciation rights maybe granted in exchange for, or in connection with, the cancellation or surrender of an option, stock appreciation right or other award having a higher option or exercise price.
9.2             If the outstanding Common Stock is increased, decreased, changed into, or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities through merger, consolidation, combination, exchange of shares, other reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, or reverse stock split, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made in the maximum number and kind of Plan Shares as to which Awards may be granted under the Plan.  A corresponding adjustment changing the number or kind of shares allocated to outstanding Awards, or portions thereof granted prior to any such change also shall be made.  Any such adjustment in outstanding Options shall be made without change in the aggregate purchase price applicable to the unexercised portion of the Options but with a corresponding adjustment in the price for each share covered by the Options.  The foregoing adjustments and the manner of application of the foregoing provisions shall be determined solely by the Committee, and any such adjustment may provide for the elimination of fractional share interests.
Adjustments.
10.1             The adoption of the Plan shall not affect any other stock option or incentive or other compensation plans in effect for the Company or any Affiliate of the Company, nor shall the Plan preclude the Company or any Affiliate thereof from establishing any other forms of incentive or other compensation plans.

Governing Law.
11.1  .  The provisions of this Article XI apply, to the extent specified in the applicable Award Agreement, to Awards granted to covered individuals within the meaning of Code Section 162(m) and to individuals who the Committee determines may be covered individuals at the time of payment of an Award.  In the event of any inconsistencies between this Article XI and the other Plan provisions, the provisions of this Article XI shall control.
Applicability
11.2    Awards, other than Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, shall be based on the attainment of certain performance goals.  No later than the earlier of (i) ninety (90) days after the commencement of the applicable fiscal year or such other award period as may be established by the Committee ("Award Period") and (ii) the completion of twenty-five percent (25%) of such Award Period, the Committee shall establish, in writing, the performance goals applicable to each such Award.  At the time the performance goals are established by the Committee, their outcome must be substantially uncertain.  In addition, the performance goal must state, in terms of an objective formula or standard, the method for computing the amount of compensation payable to the Awardee if the goal is obtained.  Such formula or standard shall be sufficiently objective so that a third party with knowledge of the relevant performance results could calculate the amount to be paid to the subject Awardee.  The material terms of the performance goals for Awardees and the compensation payable thereunder shall be submitted to the Shareholders for their review and approval if and to the extent required for such compensation to be deductible pursuant to Section 162(m) (or any successor thereto) of the Code, and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.  Shareholder approval, if necessary, shall be obtained for such performance goals prior to any Award being paid to such Awardee.  If Shareholder approval is required and the Shareholders do not approve such performance goals, no amount shall be paid to such Awardee for such applicable Award Period under the Plan.  The disclosure of the "material terms" of a performance goal and the compensation payable thereunder shall be determined under the guidelines set forth under Section 162(m) of the Code, and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.
Establishment of Performance Goals
.
11.3    Each Award to an Awardee, other than Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, shall be based on performance goals that are sufficiently objective so that a third party having knowledge of the relevant facts could determine whether the goal was met.  Except as provided in Section 11.8 hereof, performance measures that may serve as determinants of Awards shall be limited to the following measures: earnings per share; return on assets; return on equity; return on capital; net profit after taxes; net profit before taxes; economic value added; operating profits; stock price; market share; and sales or expenses.  Within ninety (90) days following the end of each Award Period, the Committee shall certify in writing that the

performance goals, and any other material terms were satisfied.  Thereafter, Awards shall be made for each Awardee as determined by the Committee.  The Awards may not vary from the pre-established amount based on the level of achievement.
11.4    Except as provided in Sections 11.8 and 11.9 hereof, each Award, other than Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, shall be based exclusively on the performance measures established by the Committee pursuant to Sections 11.2 and 11.3.
No Mid-Year Change in Awards
.
11.5    An Awardee who becomes eligible to participate in the Plan after performance goals have been established in an Award Period pursuant to Sections 11.2 and 11.3 may not participate in the Plan prior to the next succeeding Award Period, except with respect to Awards that are Options or Stock Appreciation Rights.
No Partial Award Period Participation.
11.6    Except as provided in Section 11.8 hereof, performance goals shall not be changed following their establishment, and Awardees shall not receive any payout, except with respect to Awards that are Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, when the minimum performance goals are not met or exceeded.
Performance Goals.
11.7    Except as provided in Section 11.8 hereof, subjective evaluations of individual performance of the Awardees shall not be reflected in their Awards, other than Awards that are Options or Stock Appreciation Rights.  The payment of such Awards shall be entirely dependent upon the attainment of the pre-established performance goals.
Individual Performance and Discretionary Adjustments.
11.8    No amendment of the Plan with respect to any Awardee may be made that would (i) increase the maximum amount that can be paid to any one Optionee under the Plan, (ii) change the specified performance goal for payment of Awards, or (iii) modify the requirements as to eligibility for participation in the Plan, unless the Shareholders have first approved such amendment in a manner that would permit the deduction under Section 162(m) of the Code of such payment in the fiscal year it is paid.  The Committee may amend this Article XI and such other provisions as it deems appropriate, to cause amounts payable to Awardees to satisfy the requirements of Section 162(m) and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.
Amendments.
11.9    Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan (including the provisions of this Article XI) to the contrary, the amount of compensation that an Awardee may receive with respect to Options and Stock Appreciation Rights that are granted hereunder shall be based solely on an increase in the value of the applicable shares of Common Stock after the date of grant of such Award.  Thus, no Option may be granted hereunder to an Awardee with an exercise price less than the Fair Market Value of the subject shares of Common Stock on the date of grant.  The maximum amount of compensation payable as an Award (other than an Award that is an Option or Stock Appreciation Right) to any Awardee during any calendar year may not exceed $1,000,000.  Section 1.6 sets forth the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights; Maximum Amount of Compensation.

(b) Payroll deductions for a Participant shall commence with the first payroll following the Enrollment Date and shall end on the last payroll in the Offering Period to which such authorization is applicable, unless sooner terminated by the Participant as provided in paragraph 10.
(c) An Employee who is otherwise eligible to participate herein may waive his or her right to participate for any Offering Period by declining to authorize a payroll deduction. Such declination must be filed in writing in the time and manner specified thereby.  The filing of a written declination shall result in the Employee's waiver of participation for only the Offering Period to which it relates and shall be irrevocable with respect to such Offering Period.  Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, an Employee's waiver of participation for a specified Offering Period shall not, in and of itself, adversely impact the right of such Employee to participate in the Plan during any subsequent Offering Periods except those Offering Periods with respect to which he or she files additional written declinations in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.
.
6. Payroll Deductions
(a) At the time a Participant files his or her Subscription Agreement, such Participant shall elect to have payroll deductions made on each pay date during the Offering Period at the
 
3
 
rate not to exceed ten percent (10%) of the Compensation which he or she receives on each pay date during the Offering Period, provided that the aggregate amount of such payroll deductions during the Offering Period shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the Participant's aggregate Compensation during said Offering Period.  An eligible Employee may participate in only one Offering Period at a time.
(b) All payroll deductions made by a Participant shall be credited to his or her Payroll Deduction Account under the Plan. A Participant may not make any additional payments into such Payroll Deduction Account.
(c) A Participant may discontinue his or her payroll deductions during the Offering Period by completing and filing with the Human Resources Department of the Company a new Subscription Agreement authorizing a change in the rate of payroll deductions, provided that, in the event that Participant desires to change the rate of his or her payroll deductions but to otherwise continue participating in the Plan, such a change in the rate of payroll deductions shall provide for payroll deductions of at least one percent (1%) of such Participants Compensation and any changes to his or her payroll deductions shall otherwise be made in increments of one percent (1%).  The change in rate shall be effective no earlier than fifteen (15) days following the Company's receipt of the new authorization.
.
7. Grant of Option
(a)  On the Enrollment Date of each Offering Period each Participant in such Offering Period shall be granted an option to purchase on each Exercise Date during such Offering Period up to a number of whole shares of the Company's Common Stock determined by dividing ten percent (10%) of the Participant's Compensation by eighty-five percent (85%) of the lower of (i) fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the Enrollment Date, or (ii) the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the Exercise Date; provided, however, that the number of shares subject to such option shall be reduced, if necessary, to a number of shares which would not exceed the limitations described in paragraph 3(b) or paragraph 12(a) hereof.  The fair market value of a share of the Company's Common Stock shall be determined as provided in paragraph 7(b) herein.
(b)  The exercise price per share of the shares offered in a given Offering Period shall be the lower of: (i) 85% of the fair market value of a share of the Common Stock on the Enrollment Date, or (ii) 85% of the fair market value of a share of the Common Stock on the Exercise Date.  The fair market value of the Company's Common Stock on a given date shall be the closing price of such Common Stock as reported by the NYSE, or reported on such other national exchange as it may, from time to time, be reported on, on such date (or if there shall be no trading on such date, then on the first previous date on which there is such trading), unless the Common Stock ceases to be traded on a national exchange.  If the Common Stock ceases to be traded on a national exchange, its fair market value shall be determined by the Board in its discretion.
(c)  All Employees granted options hereunder shall have the same rights and privileges subject to the limitations contained herein.
.  The Participant's option for the purchase of shares will be exercised automatically on each Exercise Date of each Offering Period, and the maximum number of full
8. Exercise of Option
 
4
 
shares subject to such option will be purchased for such Participant at the applicable exercise price with the payroll deductions accumulated in his or her Payroll Deduction Account, unless prior to such Exercise Date the Participant has withdrawn from the Offering Period or from the Exercise Period as provided in paragraph 10.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to issue fractional shares for the Participant pursuant to the Plan.  During a Participant's lifetime a Participant's option to purchase shares hereunder is exercisable only by such Participant.
.  As promptly as practicable after each Exercise Date, the Company shall arrange the delivery to each Participant, or to his or her account at a brokerage firm, of a certificate representing the shares purchased upon exercise of his or her option, provided, however, that the Board may permit or require that shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the Plan be deposited directly with a broker designated by the Board or to a designated agent of the Company. The Board may require that shares be retained with such broker or agent for a designated period of time and/or may establish other procedures to permit tracking of disqualifying dispositions of such shares.  Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, the Company, in its sole discretion, upon a Participants purchase of shares of Common Stock through exercise of his or her option, may issue such shares of Common Stock pursuant to the direct registration system, and, in lieu of the issuance of certificated shares, may issue uncertificated shares, to the account of the Participant.  Any references to share certificates shall, in such event, be deemed to refer to uncertificated shares.  Any amount remaining in the Participant's Payroll Deduction Account after an Exercise Date shall be held in the Payroll Deduction Account until the next Exercise Date in such Offering Period, unless the Offering Period has been oversubscribed or has terminated with such Exercise Date, in which case such amount shall be refunded to the Participant.  In the event that Participant transfers shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the Plan, Participant shall first give his or her Employer notice of such transfer by delivering to the Company a notice in the form attached hereto as .  Upon receipt of such notice, the Company will provide the Participant with a notice in the form attached hereto as .
9. Delivery
Exhibit B
Exhibit C
.
10.  Withdrawal; Termination of Employment
(a) A Participant may withdraw all, but not less than all, of the payroll deductions credited to his or her Payroll Deduction Account and not yet used toward the exercise of his or her option under the Plan at any time by giving written notice to the Company on a form substantially similar to attached to this Plan.  All of the Participant's payroll deductions credited to his or her Payroll Deduction Account will be paid to such Participant promptly after receipt of his or her notice of withdrawal.  A withdrawal of a Participant's Payroll Deduction Account shall terminate the Participant's participation for the Exercise Period in which the withdrawal occurs.  No further payroll deductions for the purchase of shares will be made during the Exercise Period.  A Participant may resume payroll deductions as the beginning of any subsequent Exercise Period that is within the Offering Period by delivering written notice on a form substantially similar to attached to this Plan.
Exhibit D
Exhibit E
(b) Upon termination of the Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee of the Company for any reason, he or she will be deemed to have elected to withdraw from the Plan and the payroll deductions credited to his or her Payroll Deduction Account will be returned to such Participant and his or her option will be cancelled; provided, however, that a Participant
 
5
 
who goes on a leave of absence shall be permitted to remain in the Plan with respect to an Offering Period which commenced prior to the beginning of such leave of absence.  If such Participant is not guaranteed reemployment by contract or statute and the leave of absence exceeds ninety (90) days, such Participant shall be deemed to have terminated employment on the 91st day of such leave of absence.  Payroll deductions for a Participant who has been on a leave of absence will resume upon return to work at the same rate as in effect prior to such leave unless changed by such Participant or unless the leave of absence begins in one Offering Period and ends in a subsequent Offering Period, in which case the Participant shall not be permitted to re-enter the Plan until a new Subscription Agreement is filed with respect to an Offering Period which commences after such Participant has returned to work from the leave of absence.
(c) A Participant's withdrawal from one Offering Period will not have any effect upon his or her eligibility to participate in a different Offering Period or in any similar Plan which may hereafter be adopted by the Company.  Although a Participant may withdraw from one Offering Period and join another Offering Period which commenced prior to the end of the Offering Period from which he or she withdrew, such a change shall not transfer payroll deductions from one Offering Period to another.
.  No interest shall accrue on the payroll deductions of a Participant in the Plan.
11. Interest
.
12.  Common Stock
(a) The maximum number of shares of the Company's Common Stock which shall be made available for sale under the Plan shall be five hundred thousand (500,000) shares, subject to adjustment upon changes in capitalization of the Company as provided in paragraph 18.  Either authorized and unissued shares or issued shares heretofore or hereafter reacquired by the Employer may be made subject to purchase under the Plan, in the sole and absolute discretion of the Board.  Further, if for any reason any purchase of Common Stock under the Plan is not consummated, shares subject to such purchase agreement may be subjected to a new Subscription Agreement under the Plan.  If, on a given Exercise Date, the number of shares with respect to which options are to be exercised exceeds the number of shares then available under the Plan, the Company shall make a pro rata allocation of the shares remaining available for purchase in as uniform a manner as shall be practicable and as it shall determine to be equitable.  In such event, the Company shall give written notice of such reduction of the number of shares which each Employee shall be allowed to purchase.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company shall not be obligated to issue Common Stock hereunder if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such issuance would constitute a violation of Federal or state securities laws or NYSE listing standards.
(b) The Participant will have no interest or voting right in shares covered by his or her option until such option has been exercised.
(c) Shares to be delivered to a Participant under the Plan will be registered in the name of the Participant or, at the prior written request of the Participant, in the names of the Participant and his or her spouse.
.  The Plan shall be administered by the Board or a committee appointed by the Board.  If a committee is appointed by the Board, such committee shall have all of the
13.  Administration
 
6
 
powers of the Board with respect to the Plan except for those powers set forth in paragraph 19 hereof.  Members of the Board who are eligible employees are permitted to participate in the Plan; provided, however, that (i) members of the Board who are eligible Employees may not vote on any matter affecting the administration of the Plan or the grant of any option pursuant to the Plan, and (ii) if a committee is appointed by the Board to administer the Plan, no committee member will be eligible to participate in the Plan.  The Board or a committee appointed hereunder shall have the following powers and duties:
(a) To direct the administration of the Plan in accordance with the provisions herein set forth;
(b) To adopt rules of procedure and regulations necessary for the administration of the Plan provided the rules are not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan;
(c) To determine all questions with regard to rights of Employees and Participants under the Plan, including, but not limited to, rights of eligibility of an Employee to participate in the Plan;
(d) To enforce the terms of the Plan and the rules and regulations it adopts;
(e) To direct the distribution of the shares of Common Stock purchased hereunder;
(f) To furnish the Employer with information which the Employer may require for tax or other purposes;
(g) To engage the service of counsel (who may, if appropriate, be counsel for the Employer) and agents whom it may deem advisable to assist it with the performance of its duties;
(h) To prescribe procedures to be followed by Participants in electing to participate herein;
(i) To receive from each Employer and from Employees such information as shall be necessary for the proper administration of the Plan;
(j) To maintain, or cause to be maintained, separate accounts in the name of each Participant to reflect the Participant's Payroll Deduction Account under the Plan; and
(k) To interpret and construe the Plan.
.
14. Designation of Beneficiary
(a) A Participant may file a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any shares from the Participant's Payroll Deduction Account under the Plan in the event of such Participant's death subsequent to an Exercise Date on which an option is exercised but prior to the issuance of such shares.  In addition, a Participant may file a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any cash from the Participant's Payroll Deduction Account under the Plan in the event of such Participant's death prior to the Exercise Date of the option.
 
7
 
(b) Such designation of beneficiary may be changed by the Participant at any time by delivering written notice of such change to the Company, which shall set forth the name and address of the new beneficiary.  In the event of the death of a Participant and in the absence of a beneficiary validly designated under the Plan who is living at the time of such Participant's death, the Company shall deliver such shares and/or cash to the executor or administrator of the estate of the Participant, or if no such executor or administrator has been appointed (to the knowledge of the Company), the Company, in its discretion, may deliver such shares and/or cash to the spouse or to any one or more dependents or relatives of the Participant, or if no spouse, dependent or relative is known to the Company, then to such other person as the Company may designate.
.  Neither payroll deductions credited to Participant's Payroll Deduction Account nor any rights with regard to the exercise of an option to receive shares under the Plan may be assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of in any way (other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution or as provided in paragraph 14 hereof) by the Participant.  Any such attempt at assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition, other than as permitted in the Code, shall be without effect, except that the Company may treat such act as an election to withdraw funds in accordance with paragraph 10.
15. Transferability
  All payroll deductions received or held by the Company under the Plan may be used by the Company for any corporate purpose, and the Company shall not be obligated to segregate such payroll deductions.
16. Use of Funds.
.  Individual Payroll Deduction Accounts will be maintained for each Participant in the Plan.  Statements of Payroll Deduction Account will be given to participating Employees promptly following an Exercise Date, which statements will set forth the amounts of payroll deductions, the per share purchase price, the number of shares purchased and the remaining cash balance, if any.
17. Reports
.  If an option under this Plan is exercised subsequent to any stock dividend, stock split, spinoff, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, exchange of shares or the like, occurring after such option was granted, as a result of which shares of any class shall be issued in respect of the outstanding shares, or shares shall be changed into a different number of the same or another class or classes, the number of shares to which such option shall be applicable and the option price for such shares shall be appropriately adjusted by the Company.  Any such adjustment, however, in the Common Stock shall be made without change in the total price applicable to the portion of the Common Stock purchased hereunder which has not been fully paid for, but with a corresponding adjustment, if appropriate, in the price for each share of Common Stock.
18. Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization
In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Offering Period will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Board.  In the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or  the merger of the Company with or into another corporation, each option under the Plan shall be assumed or an equivalent option shall be substituted by such successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation, unless the Board determines, in the exercise of its sole discretion and in lieu of such assumption or substitution, that the Participant shall have the right to exercise the option as to all of the optioned stock,
 
8
 
including shares as to which the option would not otherwise be exercisable.  If the Board makes an option fully exercisable, in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Board shall notify the Participant that the option shall be fully exercisable for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of such notice, and the option will terminate upon the expiration of such period.
.  The Board may at any time and for any reason terminate or amend the Plan.  Except as specifically provided in the Plan, no such termination can affect options previously granted, provided that an Offering Period may be terminated by the Board on any Exercise Date if the Board determines that the termination of the Plan is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.  Except as specifically provided in the Plan or as required to obtain a favorable ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, no amendment may make any change in any option theretofore granted which adversely affects the rights of any Participant.  To the extent necessary to comply with Section 423 of the Code (or any successor rule or provision or any other applicable law or regulation), the Rules of the NYSE or any other requirement applicable to the Employer, the Company shall obtain shareholder approval in such manner and to such a degree as required.  Furthermore, the Board shall not modify, extend or renew any option granted hereunder that would subject the option to Section 409A of the Code pursuant to Treasury Regulation  1.409A-1(b)(5)(ii) or take any other action that would result in an impermissible deferral of compensation in violation of Section 409A of the Code.
19. Amendment or Termination
.  All notices or other communications by a Participant to the Company under or in connection with the Plan shall be deemed to have been duly given when received in the form specified by the Company at the location, or by the person, designated by the Company for the receipt thereof.
20. Notices
.  Commencement of the Plan shall be subject to approval by the shareholders of the Company within twelve months before or after the date the Plan is adopted.
21. Shareholder Approval
.  Shares shall not be issued with respect to an option unless the exercise of such option and the issuance and delivery of such shares  pursuant thereto shall comply with all applicable provisions of law, domestic or foreign, including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the shares may then be listed, and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
22. Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares
As a condition to the exercise of an option, the Company may require the person exercising such option to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute, such shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required by any of the aforementioned applicable provisions of law.
.  The Plan shall become effective upon the earlier to occur of its adoption by the Board or its approval by the shareholders of the Company as described in paragraph 21.  It shall continue in effect for a term of ten (10) years unless sooner terminated under paragraph 19.
23. Term of Plan
 
9
 
.  Nothing contained in this Plan or any modification or amendment to the Plan or in the creation of any Participant's Payroll Deduction Account, or the execution of any participation election form, or the issuance of any shares of Common Stock, shall give any Employee or Participant any right to continue employment, any legal or equitable right against the Employer or Company or  any officer, director, or Employee of the Employer or Company, except as expressly provided by the Plan.
24. No Rights Implied
.  In the event any provision of the Plan shall be held to be illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions of the Plan, but shall be fully severable and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had never been included herein.
25. Severability
.  Any notice required to be given herein by the Employer, the Company or the Board shall be deemed delivered, when (a) personally delivered, or (b) placed in the United States mails, in an envelope addressed to the last known address of the person to whom the notice is given.
26. Notice
.  Any person entitled to notice under the Plan may waive the notice.
27. Waiver of Notice

28. Successors and Assigns
.  The titles and headings of the paragraphs are included for convenience of reference only and are not to be considered in construction of the provisions hereof.
29. Headings
.  All questions arising with respect to the provisions of this Agreement shall be determined by application of the laws of the State of Texas except to the extent Texas law is preempted by Federal statute.  The obligation of the Employer to sell and deliver Common Stock under the Plan is subject to applicable laws and to the approval of any governmental authority required in connection with the authorization, issuance, sale or delivery of such Common Stock.
30. Law
.  Neither the members of the Board nor any member of the committee appointed by the Board (nor their delegates) shall be liable for any act, omission, or determination taken or made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any right to purchase shares of Common Stock granted under it, and members of the Board and such committee (and their delegatees) shall be entitled to indemnification and reimbursement by the Company in respect of any claim, loss, damage, or expense (including attorneys' fees, the costs of settling any suit, provided such settlement is approved by independent legal counsel selected by the Company, and amounts paid in satisfaction of a judgment, except a judgment based on a finding of bad faith) arising therefrom to the full extent permitted by law and under any directors and officers liability or similar insurance coverage that may from time to time be in effect.
31. No Liability for Good Faith Determinations
.  Except as provided in paragraph 32, the provisions of this Plan shall be applied separately to each Subsidiary and its employees exactly as if each such Subsidiary participating in the Plan was the sole and only employer which is a party hereto.  Except in paragraph 32, the word Employer, wherever used herein, shall be deemed to refer only to the particular Employer separately insofar as that Employer and its Employees are
32. Application of Plan Provisions
 
10
 
concerned, and likewise the words Employee, Employees, Participant and Participants shall be deemed to refer solely to the Employees of that particular Employer, or such of them as may become Participants, as if their Employer were the sole and only Employer which is a party hereto.

The strong demand for our products led to an outstanding level of orders with strength in both the domestic and international markets.  We are now operating with a record backlog and are pleased with the balance between our product offerings and the product destination geography.  The power generation, transmission and distribution markets continued to expand and our industrial markets remained strong.  Our backlog for the quarter was also positively impacted as a result of the backlog associated with the Blenkhorn and Sawle acquisition in Canada.  This impact was approximately $13 million.  The quarterly shipments were moderately adversely impacted by some capacity constraints of our vendors and delays in receipt of customer engineering specifications, which resulted in some scheduled shipments moving from the second quarter to the third quarter.  The domestic and international quotation and inquiry activity continues to be good.  Our challenge is to continue to seek out every opportunity to expand our served markets and add to our product offerings.
Revenues for the Companys Galvanizing Service Segment increased 41 percent to $51.3 million for the second quarter ending August 31, 2008, compared to $36.5 million in the previous years comparable quarter. Operating income for this segment was $15.5 million, compared to $9.2 million in the same quarter last year, an increase of 68 percent.  Operating margins for the second quarter ending August 31, 2008 were 30 percent.  The quarterly results do reflect the positive impact of an insurance settlement related to a fire at one of our facilities.  This resulted in a gain of $1.3 million pre tax and is included in the operating income.  Without this gain, operating margins would be 28 percent as compared to 25 percent in the prior year second quarter period. For the first six months of fiscal 2009, revenues increased 40 percent to $99.3 million, and operating income increased 62 percent to $28.8 million, compared to $71 million and $17.8 million, respectively, for the first six months of the prior year.  AAA Galvanizing acquired on April 1, 2008, contributed $21.8 million to our total six months revenues.  Our revenues generated from our historical operations prior to the acquisition of AAA for the first six months period increased 9 percent.  Volume of steel processed increased 12 percent, while average selling price decreased 2 percent as compared to the same six months period in the prior year.
Mr. Dingus continued, Robust market demand for our galvanizing services has positively impacted our ability to maximize our operating results.  The assimilation of the acquisitions is going extremely well and demand has remained excellent.  Pricing pressures may increase due to changes in demand brought about by economic conditions or the increased cost of steel.  These issues combined with the seasonal winter impact on our North Central U.S. facilities may result in lower fourth quarter demand. The strategic actions that we have taken in this segment over the past few years has broadened our customer base and we believe it will continue to help us to offset some portion of any economic weakness we may encounter in a particular market area.  Our expanded geographic presence combined with our firm commitment to a superior level of
 
 
 
AZZ Second Quarter  Fiscal Year 2009

Page 3
service and support should enable us to continue to report good results for this segment for the balance of our fiscal year that are above our historical 18 to 22 percent operating margins. As long as demand remains strong, we do not anticipate significant pricing pressures.  While our zinc cost has decreased, other operating materials and natural gas have increased, requiring us to continue to strive to maintain pricing in order to fully recover these costs. 
Mr. Dingus concluded, Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are increasing our previously issued guidance for fiscal year 2009. Our earnings are estimated to be within the range of $3.25 and $3.35 per diluted share and revenues to be within the range of $420 to $430 million.  Our estimates assume that we will not have any significant delays in the delivery of our electrical and industrial products, or that there will not be a significant change in galvanizing demand, pricing or any further adverse weather conditions prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.

January 9, 2009  - AZZ incorporated (NYSE:AZZ), a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services today announced unaudited financial results for the three and nine-month periods ended November 30, 2008. Revenues for the third quarter increased 26 percent to $108.9 million, compared to $86.6 million for the same period last year. Net income for the third quarter increased 34 percent to $10.8 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, compared to net income of $8.1 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, in last years fiscal third quarter.
FORT WORTH, TX
.
For the nine-month period, the Company reported revenues of $312.1 million, an increase of 28 percent compared to $243.6 million for the comparable period last year. Net income for the nine months rose 58 percent to $32.2 million, or $2.62 per diluted share, compared to $20.4 million, or $1.67 per diluted share for the comparable nine-month period last year
The unaudited financial results for the three and nine month periods ended November 30, 2008, were favorably impacted by the acquisition of AAA Galvanizing, Inc. acquired on March 31, 2008 and the acquisition of Blenkhorn & Sawle Ltd. on June 30, 2008.
Backlog at the end of the third quarter was a record setting $195.3 million versus $147.1 million at November 30, 2007, an increase of 33 percent.  Backlog at the end of the second quarter was $190.8 million.  Incoming orders for the third quarter totaled $113.3 million while shipments totaled $108.9 million resulting in a book to ship ratio of 104 percent. For the first nine months, orders totaled $359.2 million while shipments totaled $312.1 million, resulting in a year-to-date book to ship ratio of 115 percent.  Incoming orders for the first nine months increased 33 percent when compared to the same period a year ago.  Based upon current customer requested delivery dates and our planned production schedule, 34 percent of our backlog is expected to ship in the current fiscal year.  Of our $195.3 million backlog, 35 percent is to be delivered outside of the U.S.

Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment increased 20 percent to $62 million for the third quarter, compared to $51.5 million in the previous years third quarter. Operating income for this segment was $10.4 million, compared to $8.0 million in the third quarter of last year, an increase of 30 percent. For the first nine months, revenues increased 21 percent to $165.9 million and operating income increased 26 percent to $28.1 million compared to $137.5 and $ 22.3 million, respectively, for the first nine months of the prior year.
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer, commented, The results of the third quarter for this segment closely mirror those of the excellent results of the first and second quarters of FY 2009.  Strong order levels for our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment continued in the third quarter.  New orders were balanced across our power generation, transmission and distribution, and industrial products. While there is future potential for some order delays due to the economic and credit conditions, to date we have seen only isolated cases domestically where delays have been implemented. The leverage gained from improved volumes and improved operating efficiency and pricing is reflected in our operating margins.  Operating margins for the first nine months are 17 percent versus 16 percent for the same period last year. Our challenge remains to continue to achieve growth by expanding our served markets and increasing our product offerings while maintaining our targeted margin levels.
Revenues for the Companys Galvanizing Services Segment increased 34 percent to $46.9 million for the third quarter, compared to $35.1 million in the previous years comparable quarter. Operating income for this segment was $13.1 million, an increase of 58 percent, compared to $8.3 million in the same quarter last year.  For the first nine months of fiscal 2009, revenues increased 38 percent to $146.2 million, and operating income increased 60 percent to $42 million, compared to $106.1 and $26.2 million, respectively, for the first nine months of the prior year.  AAA Galvanizing acquired on March 31, 2008, contributed $33.7 million to our total nine months revenue.  Our revenues generated from our historical operations prior to the acquisition of AAA for the first nine month period increased 6 percent.  While our volume of steel processed increased, our average selling price decreased 2 percent as compared to the same nine month period in the prior year.
Mr. Dingus continued, Strong market demand throughout most of our markets, combined with superior levels of quality and service, positively impact our ability in the third quarter to maintain strong pricing and margins despite changes in the cost of zinc. We achieved excellent operating margins for the quarter of 28 percent.  We are most pleased that our tonnage processed for the first nine months of the current fiscal year reflected double digit growth due primarily to acquisitions. Margins remained solidly ahead of prior years. We will continue to closely monitor U.S. industrial market indicators to determine the potential impact upon our markets.  During the third quarter decreased demand was limited to markets in our upper Midwest U.S. operations.  We are extremely pleased with the assimilation of AAA galvanizing into our operations and their year to date results show improvement over historical levels.
Mr. Dingus concluded, Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are increasing our previously issued earnings guidance for fiscal year 2009.  Our earnings are estimated to be within the range of $3.35 and $3.45 per diluted share. Revenues are estimated to be within the range of $420 and $430 million, which is unchanged from the

previously issued guidance. Our estimates assume that we will not have any significant delays in the delivery of our electrical and industrial products, and that the demand for galvanizing services and pricing will not significantly change from current levels during the balance of the fiscal year.

Section 7-Regulation FD
 
 
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 are materials to be used by representatives of AZZ incorporated, a Texas corporation (the Company), in future presentations to the financial community.
Pursuant to General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K, shall not be deemed to be filed for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.
The information contained herein is summary information that is intended to be considered in the context of our SEC filings and other public announcements that we may make, by press release or otherwise, from time to time.
The Company undertakes no duty or obligation to publicly update or revise the information contained in this report, although the Company may do so from time to time as management of the Company believes is warranted. Any such updating may be made through the filing of other reports or documents with the SEC, through press releases or through other public disclosure.
In connection with such future presentations to the financial community, reconciliations between EBITDA (as defined below) and net income and between Free Cash Flow (as define below) to cash provided by operating activities are provided as follows. As used by the Company, these terms may differ from similarly captioned measures used by other companies.
EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  The Company presents EBITDA because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization, many of which present EBITDA when reporting their results.  The Company also uses EBITDA for the following purposes: (1) the Companys credit agreement uses EBITDA to measure compliance with covenants, such as fixed charge coverage and debt incurrence; (2) EBITDA is also used by potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions with the Company; and (3) EBITDA is also used by the Company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  Some of these limitations are: (a) EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Companys working capital needs, (b) EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Companys debts; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures.  Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Companys performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using EBITDA only on a supplemental basis.
Free Cash Flow (FCF), also a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash disbursed for capital expenditures excluding acquisitions.  The Company presents FCF because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization to the Company, many of which present FCF when reporting their results.
FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  These limitations include that FCF excludes significant cash flows, such as principal payments on debt.  Because of these limitations, FCF should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Companys performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using FCF only on a supplemental basis.

Net income for the year was up 52 percent to $42.2 million, or $3.43 per diluted share, compared to $27.7 million, or $2.26 per diluted share for the comparable twelve-month period last year. Incoming orders for the twelve-month period were $439.1 million, while fiscal year revenues totaled $412.4 million, resulting in a book to ship ratio of 106 percent. Incoming orders for the fiscal year of $439.1 million increased 31 percent when compared to the prior fiscal year.
Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment were $59.9 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $41.7 million in the previous years fourth quarter, an increase of 44 percent. Operating income for this segment increased 58 percent to $10.8 million, compared to $6.8 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Operating income margins for the fourth quarter of 18 percent compare favorably to the 16 percent in the prior year.  For the fiscal year ended
February 28, 2009 revenues increased 26 percent to $225.8 million and operating income rose 34 percent to $39.0 million, which compared favorably to the $179.2 million and $29.2 million, respectively, in the prior fiscal year.  Operating income margins for the fiscal year improved to 17 percent from the 16 percent in the prior fiscal year.

David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer, commented, We are very pleased with the growth and expansion of the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment for fiscal 2009.  The full year results reflected improvement in every operating measurement. As we go forward, we continue to monitor closely our market opportunities and our operating structure due to the changing and challenging market conditions. Recently, incoming orders have been slower than desired due to increased customer deliberation on the release of new orders pertaining to projects that are in process as well as those that are in the planning phase.  This combined with increased competitive pressure, particularly on large international quotations, has had an adverse impact on our incoming order rate.  Our book to ship ratio for the quarter was essentially the same as it has been in the fourth quarter, three of the past four years. The fourth quarter continued to be a difficult quarter for us in terms of incoming orders.  However, different than in prior years, we do not anticipate that our backlog will increase in the second quarter or recover to the record setting level of the third quarter of fiscal 2009 until we see improvement in our markets. We remain optimistic that we will see some leveling of our backlog after the second quarter and a modest recovery as we enter our fiscal 2011.   Margins were very strong in the fourth quarter and fiscal year due to pricing discipline, improved project management, and assisted by favorable cost of key commodities.  Our challenge is to continue to succeed in our efforts to expand our served markets and product offerings, while maintaining our strong operating performance and management of our cost/price ratios consistent with our historical practices.
Revenues for the Companys Galvanizing Service Segment were $40.4 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $34.9 million in the previous years comparable quarter, an increase of 16 percent. Operating income was up 26 percent to $11.2 million in the fourth quarter as compared to $8.9 million in the same quarter last year.  Operating income margins for the fourth quarter were 28 percent versus 26 percent in same period last year.  For the fiscal year, revenues increased 32 percent to $186.6 million, and operating income rose 52 percent to $53.2 million compared to $141.0 million and $35.1 million, respectively, for the prior fiscal year.  Operating margins were 29 percent for the fiscal year compared to 25 percent in the prior fiscal year.
Mr. Dingus continued, Shipments for the fiscal year increased 37 percent, with 86 percent of the increase attributable to an acquisition made during fiscal 2009.  For the full fiscal year pricing was down 2 percent.  Demand for galvanizing services in the fourth quarter varied across our served markets.  Our infrastructure work related to electrical and telecommunications, as well as the petrochemical remained at a strong pace, while other markets did see deterioration due the domestic economic conditions. Margins were extremely strong for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year.  We have seen additional pricing deterioration since the first of calendar 2009 and do believe that fiscal 2010 will reflect a continuation of these conditions.  Fortunately our cost structure is benefiting from lower commodity cost partially offsetting the adverse impact of price adjustments.  The effective execution of our business strategies, capitalizing on our market opportunities, and meeting or exceeding our margin projections has very positively contributed to our Fiscal 2009 success.  We anticipate that we will be able to retain our strong market leadership position in the new fiscal year.

The strength of our balance sheet, strong cash position, combined with access to borrowings under our existing banking agreements, should facilitate the execution of our business strategies.
Mr. Dingus concluded, On January 16, 2009, the company issued projections for Fiscal 2010 that revenues would be in the range of $420 to $440 million and that fully diluted earnings per share would be in the range of $2.75 to $2.95.  Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are revising our guidance for revenues to be in the range of $395 to $415 million.  Our earnings guidance remains unchanged from that previously issued. We continue to strive to build upon the success we have been able to achieve, and continually strive to maximize the performance of the Company.  Our estimates assume that we will not have any appreciable change in our current market conditions, significant delays in the delivery or timing in the receipt of orders of our electrical and industrial products, and that the pricing and demand for our galvanizing services will not significantly change from our current outlook in fiscal 2010.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
Section 7-Regulation FD
 
 
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 are materials to be used by representatives of AZZ incorporated, a Texas corporation (the Company), in future presentations to the financial community.
Pursuant to General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K, shall not be deemed to be filed for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.
The information contained herein is summary information that is intended to be considered in the context of our SEC filings and other public announcements that we may make, by press release or otherwise, from time to time.
The Company undertakes no duty or obligation to publicly update or revise the information contained in this report, although the Company may do so from time to time as management of the Company believes is warranted. Any such updating may be made through the filing of other reports or documents with the SEC, through press releases or through other public disclosure.
In connection with such future presentations to the financial community, reconciliations between EBITDA (as defined below) and net income and between Free Cash Flow (as define below) to cash provided by operating activities are provided as follows. As used by the Company, these terms may differ from similarly captioned measures used by other companies.
EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  The Company presents EBITDA because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization, many of which present EBITDA when reporting their results.  The Company also uses EBITDA for the following purposes: (1) the Companys credit agreement uses EBITDA to measure compliance with covenants, such as fixed charge coverage and debt incurrence; (2) EBITDA is also used by potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions with the Company; and (3) EBITDA is also used by the Company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  Some of these limitations are: (a) EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Companys working capital needs, (b) EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Companys debts; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures.  Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Companys performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using EBITDA only on a supplemental basis.
Free Cash Flow (FCF), also a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash disbursed for capital expenditures excluding acquisitions.  The Company presents FCF because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization to the Company, many of which present FCF when reporting their results.
FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  These limitations include that FCF excludes significant cash flows, such as principal payments on debt.  Because of these limitations, FCF should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Companys performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using FCF only on a supplemental basis.

 - AZZ incorporated , a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services, today announced unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended May 31, 2009. Revenues for the first quarter were $95.5 million compared to $99.9 million for the same quarter last year, a decrease of 5 percent. Net income for the quarter was $9.9 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, compared to net income of $10.1 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, in last years first fiscal quarter.
June

FORT WORTH, TX
(NYSE:AZZ)
Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $150.1 million. Backlog at the end of the first quarter of FY 2009 was $141.8 million and $174.8 million at February 28, 2009.  Incoming orders for the first quarter were $70.7 million while shipments for the quarter totaled $95.5 million, resulting in a book to ship ratio of 74 percent.  There were no significant international orders received in the first quarter of FY 2010.  Based upon current customer requested delivery dates and our production schedules, 91 percent of the backlog at May 31, 2009 is expected to ship in the current fiscal year.  Of the backlog of $150.1 million, 39 percent is to be delivered outside of the U.S.
Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment for the first quarter of FY 2010 were $55.4 million as compared to $52.0 million for the same quarter last year, an increase of 7 percent.  Operating income for the segment increased 33 percent to $10.5 million compared to $7.9 million in the same period last year.  Operating margins for the first quarter were 19 percent.
Revenues for the Companys Galvanizing Service Segment for the first quarter were $40.1 million, compared to the $48.0 million in the same period last year, a decrease of 16 percent.  Operating income was $12.8 million as compared to $13.4 million in the prior period. Tonnage shipped decreased 12 percent when compared to the prior period. Operating margins for the first quarter were 32 percent.
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of AZZ incorporated, commented, Regarding our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment, again this quarter, we are extremely pleased with the operating performance.  As we indicated last quarter, we continue to monitor closely our market opportunities and our operating structure due to the changing and challenging market conditions.  Incoming orders slowed in the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2009 and we have seen a continuation of that trend in the first quarter of our new fiscal year.  While our quotation levels have increased during the quarter when compared to the fourth quarter of last fiscal year,
 
 
 
AZZ First Quarter  Fiscal Year 2010
June 26, 2009
Page 2 
we have not seen a corresponding increase in our incoming order rate.  Incoming orders continue to be slower than desired due to increased customer deliberation on the release of new orders pertaining to projects and increased competitive pressure, particularly on large international orders, combined with the typical delay we see between quotations and orders.  We still anticipate that our backlog will level off at the end of the second quarter followed by modest increases in the last half of the fiscal year.  Despite the improvement in our quotation levels, we anticipate a further deterioration of our backlog in the second quarter of 10 to 15 percent.  Competitive conditions in some of our international markets could improve allowing us to secure additional business which could offset this projected deterioration.  If market conditions improve, as well as an expansion of infrastructure projects, we are well positioned to capitalize on these improvements.  We will continue our efforts to expand our served markets and product offerings, and believe that the strength of our historical operating performance, combined with the excellent positioning of our products, provide an excellent platform from which to grow once we do see market recovery and continue the trend of increasing quotation levels.
The Galvanizing Services Segment achieved outstanding operating performance considering the market conditions in which we are operating.  We continue to demonstrate our commitment to quality and service during these market conditions and take advantage of all opportunities to maintain market pricing.  The lower zinc cost in our first quarter combined with increased operating efficiencies, facilitated excellent margins.  Our infrastructure work remained at levels consistent with the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year.  We remain committed to our market approach and believe that we will continue to report strong operating results, despite the challenges we face.  Margins for the balance of the fiscal year are expected to be below that achieved in the first quarter, but should remain above the historical levels that we have talked to you about before of 18 to 22 percent.
Mr. Dingus concluded, Management of pricing, expansion of domestic and international markets, and seeking out new product opportunities to further enhance our strategic position continue to be the focus and emphasis of our activities. Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are revising our guidance for revenues to be in the range of $370 million to $390 million.  Our earning guidance is revised and anticipated to be within the range of $2.70 to $2.90.  Achievement of these projections would be our 23 consecutive year of profitability and the second best year in the history of the company.  Our estimates assume that we will not have any appreciable change in our current market conditions, competitive activity or significant delays in the delivery or timing in the receipt of orders of our electrical and industrial products, and demand for our galvanizing services.

Section 7-Regulation FD
 
 
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 are materials to be used by representatives of AZZ incorporated, a Texas corporation (the Company), in future presentations to the financial community.
Pursuant to General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K, shall not be deemed to be filed for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.
The information contained herein is summary information that is intended to be considered in the context of our SEC filings and other public announcements that we may make, by press release or otherwise, from time to time.
The Company undertakes no duty or obligation to publicly update or revise the information contained in this report, although the Company may do so from time to time as management of the Company believes is warranted. Any such updating may be made through the filing of other reports or documents with the SEC, through press releases or through other public disclosure.
In connection with such future presentations to the financial community, reconciliations between EBITDA (as defined below) and net income and between Free Cash Flow (as define below) to cash provided by operating activities are provided as follows. As used by the Company, these terms may differ from similarly captioned measures used by other companies.
EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  The Company presents EBITDA because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization, many of which present EBITDA when reporting their results.  The Company also uses EBITDA for the following purposes: (1) the Companys credit agreement uses EBITDA to measure compliance with covenants, such as fixed charge coverage and debt incurrence; (2) EBITDA is also used by potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions with the Company; and (3) EBITDA is also used by the Company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  Some of these limitations are: (a) EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Companys working capital needs, (b) EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Companys debts; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures.  Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Companys performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using EBITDA only on a supplemental basis.
Free Cash Flow (FCF), also a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash disbursed for capital expenditures excluding acquisitions.  The Company presents FCF because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization to the Company, many of which present FCF when reporting their results.
FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  These limitations include that FCF excludes significant cash flows, such as principal payments on debt.  Because of these limitations, FCF should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Companys performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using FCF only on a supplemental basis.

September 25, 2008  - AZZ incorporated (NYSE:AZZ), a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services today announced unaudited financial results for the three and six-month periods ended August 31, 2009. Revenues for the second quarter were $95.2 million compared to $103.3 million for the same quarter last year, a decrease of 7.8 percent. Net income for the second quarter was $11.1 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, compared to net income of $11.3 million, or $0.92 per share, in last years second quarter.
FORT WORTH, TX
For the six-month period, the Company reported revenues of $190.6 million compared to $203.2 million for the comparable period last year, a decrease of 6.2 percent. Net income for the six months was $21.0 million, or $1.69 per share, compared to $21.4 million, or $1.74 per share in the comparable period of last year.
Backlog at the end of our second quarter ending August 31, 2009 was $139.4 million.  Backlog at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2009 was $190.8 million and $174.8 million at February 28, 2009.  Incoming orders for the second quarter totaled $84.5 million while shipments totaled $95.2 million resulting in a book to ship ratio of 89 percent. For the first six months, orders totaled $155.2 million while shipments totaled $190.6 million, resulting in a year-to-date book to ship ratio of 81 percent.  Based upon current customer requested delivery dates and our planned production schedule, 65 percent of our backlog is expected to ship in the current fiscal year.  Of our $139.4 million backlog, 43 percent is to be delivered outside of the U.S.
Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment increased 7 percent to $55.6 million for the second quarter ending August 31, 2009, compared to $52 million in the previous years second quarter. Operating income for the second quarter ending August 31, 2009, was $12.1 million, compared to $9.8 million in the second quarter of last year, an increase of 23 percent. Operating margins were 22 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2010.  For the first six months, revenues increased 7 percent to $111 million and operating income increased 28 percent to $22.6 million compared to $104 million and $17.7 million, respectively, for the first six months of the prior year. Operating margins for the first six months were 20 percent.
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer, commented, The operating results for our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment continued at a very strong pace.  The increase in domestic and international quotation activity which we reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 has continued into the second quarter.  The primary increases have been in our power generation,

transmission and distribution markets.  While some of the increase can be attributed to the budgetary quotations of new projects that have yet to be released, it is still encouraging that overall project activity has increased.  The release of the orders for new and existing projects remains sluggish and we have not seen any decrease in the extended evaluation period we have witnessed for the past nine months.  We anticipate the slow and selective release of orders continuing into our third quarter.  While it is difficult to forecast timing of order releases in current market conditions, we would anticipate that it will be the first quarter of our fiscal 2011 before we start seeing a rebuilding of our backlog.  Our international quotations are strong and we did secure two significant international orders in the second quarter.
Revenues for the Companys Galvanizing Service Segment decreased 23 percent to $39.6 million for the second quarter ending August 31, 2009, compared to $51.3 million in the previous years comparable quarter. Operating income for this segment was $12.3 million, compared to $15.5 million in the same quarter last year, a decrease of 21 percent.  Operating margins for the second quarter ending August 31, 2009 were 31 percent.  For the first six months of fiscal 2010, revenues decreased 20 percent to $79.7 million, and operating income decreased 13 percent to $25.1 million, compared to $99.3 million and $28.8 million, respectively, for the first six months of the prior year.  Volume of steel processed decreased 15 percent, while average selling price decreased 5 percent when compared to the same six months period in the prior year.
Operating margins for the six month period was 31.5%.
Mr. Dingus continued, Demand for our galvanizing services continues to be below the record setting pace of last year.  Our continuing commitment to quality and service, close attention to all operating performance criteria and favorable cost of commodities, led to another outstanding margin performance quarter.  The strategic actions that we have taken in this segment over the past few years have broadened our customer base and geographic presence.  We believe this has and should continue to help us to offset some of the economic weakness in particular market areas.
Mr. Dingus concluded, As a company, we are extremely well positioned to take advantage of any improving market conditions.  We are looking for opportunities to better our positioning with new products and new markets, and the strength of our balance sheet with $72 million in cash should increase our chances for success in implementation of our Strategic Plans. Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are revising our previously issued guidance for fiscal year 2010. Our earnings are estimated to be within the range of $3.00 and $3.10 per diluted share and revenues to be within the range of $370 million to $380 million.  The previous estimates were for earnings to be within the range of $2.70 to $2.90 and revenues to be in the range of $370 million to $390 million.  Our estimates assume that we will not have any appreciable change in our current market conditions, competitive activity or significant delays or timing in the receipt of orders of our electrical and industrial products, and demand for our galvanizing services.
AZZ incorporated will conduct a conference call to discuss financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 at 11:00 a.m. ET on September 25, 2009.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
Section 7-Regulation FD
 
 
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 are materials to be used by representatives of AZZ incorporated, a Texas corporation (the Company), in future presentations to the financial community.
Pursuant to General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K, shall not be deemed to be filed for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.
The information contained herein is summary information that is intended to be considered in the context of our SEC filings and other public announcements that we may make, by press release or otherwise, from time to time.
The Company undertakes no duty or obligation to publicly update or revise the information contained in this report, although the Company may do so from time to time as management of the Company believes is warranted. Any such updating may be made through the filing of other reports or documents with the SEC, through press releases or through other public disclosure.
In connection with such future presentations to the financial community, reconciliations between EBITDA (as defined below) and net income and between Free Cash Flow (as define below) to cash provided by operating activities are provided as follows. As used by the Company, these terms may differ from similarly captioned measures used by other companies.
EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  The Company presents EBITDA because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization, many of which present EBITDA when reporting their results.  The Company also uses EBITDA for the following purposes: (1) the Companys credit agreement uses EBITDA to measure compliance with covenants, such as fixed charge coverage and debt incurrence; (2) EBITDA is also used by potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions with the Company; and (3) EBITDA is also used by the Company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  Some of these limitations are: (a) EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Companys working capital needs, (b) EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Companys debts; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures.  Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Companys performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using EBITDA only on a supplemental basis.
Free Cash Flow (FCF), also a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash disbursed for capital expenditures excluding acquisitions.  The Company presents FCF because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization to the Company, many of which present FCF when reporting their results.
FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.

 release of the orders for new and existing projects remains sluggish.  We believe these delays have resulted from the current reduction in the demand for oil and gas and electrical power, the uncertainty in the worldwide economy and financial markets, as well as increasing uncertainty as to the impact that potential regulatory changes could have on our customers businesses.  We do believe that our long term opportunities remain strong and that this delay in capital project investment decisions should subside if financial markets continue to stabilize and the impact of regulatory changes are more predictable.  These conditions have impacted our domestic market more than our served international markets.  It is difficult to forecast timing of improved order trends.  Based upon quotation levels and customer feedback, we do not anticipate that the recovery will be seen during the balance of our current fiscal year.  We will continue our efforts to effectively and efficiently secure and execute on the available business opportunities that we do have.
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer, commented, The operating margin for our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment continued strong despite lower volumes.  The 
Revenues for the Companys Galvanizing Service Segment decreased 19 percent to $37.9 million for the third quarter ending November 30, 2009, compared to $46.9 million in the previous years comparable quarter. Operating income for this segment was $10.5 million, compared to $13.1 million in the same quarter last year, a decrease of 20 percent.  Operating margins for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 were 28 percent.  For the first nine months of fiscal 2010, revenues decreased 20 percent to $117.6 million, and operating income decreased 15 percent to $35.6 million, compared to $146.2 million and $42 million, respectively, for the first nine months of the prior year.  Operating margin for the nine month period was 30 percent.  Volume of steel processed decreased 13 percent, while average selling price decreased 6 percent when compared to the same nine months period in the prior year.
Mr. Dingus continued, Demand for our galvanizing services continues to be below the record setting pace of last year.  Despite this lower demand, we had another outstanding margin performance quarter.  We will continue our efforts to implement our strategic plans for the segment that should broaden our customer base and expand geographic presence.  The actions we have taken should continue to help us to offset some of the economic weakness in particular market areas.
Mr. Dingus concluded, As a company, we are extremely well positioned to take advantage of any improving market conditions combined with opportunities to better our positioning with new products and new markets, and the strength of our balance sheet should increase our chances for success in implementation of our strategic plans. Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are revising our previously issued revenue guidance for fiscal year 2010, while maintaining our previously issued earnings guidance. Our earnings are estimated to be within the range of $3.00 and $3.10 per diluted share and revenues to be within the range of $355 million to $365 million.  The previous estimates were for earnings to be within the range of $3.00 to $3.10 and revenues to be in the range of $370 million to $380 million.  Our estimates assume that we will not have any appreciable change in our current market conditions, competitive activity or significant delays or timing in the receipt of orders of our electrical and industrial products, and demand for our galvanizing services.

Section 7-Regulation FD
 
 
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 are materials to be used by representatives of AZZ incorporated, a Texas corporation (the Company), in future presentations to the financial community.
Pursuant to General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K, shall not be deemed to be filed for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.
The information contained herein is summary information that is intended to be considered in the context of our SEC filings and other public announcements that we may make, by press release or otherwise, from time to time.
The Company undertakes no duty or obligation to publicly update or revise the information contained in this report, although the Company may do so from time to time as management of the Company believes is warranted. Any such updating may be made through the filing of other reports or documents with the SEC, through press releases or through other public disclosure.
In connection with such future presentations to the financial community, reconciliations between EBITDA (as defined below) and net income and between Free Cash Flow (as define below) to cash provided by operating activities are provided as follows. As used by the Company, these terms may differ from similarly captioned measures used by other companies.
EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  The Company presents EBITDA because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization, many of which present EBITDA when reporting their results.  The Company also uses EBITDA for the following purposes: (1) the Companys credit agreement uses EBITDA to measure compliance with covenants, such as fixed charge coverage and debt incurrence; (2) EBITDA is also used by potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions with the Company; and (3) EBITDA is also used by the Company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  Some of these limitations are: (a) EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Companys working capital needs, (b) EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Companys debts; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures.  Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Companys performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using EBITDA only on a supplemental basis.
Free Cash Flow (FCF), also a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash disbursed for capital expenditures excluding acquisitions.  The Company presents FCF because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization to the Company, many of which present FCF when reporting their results.

February 17, 2010  - AZZ incorporated (NYSE:AZZ), a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services today announced a revision to the previously issued revenue and earnings guidance for Fiscal 2010. The revision is due to a continuation of slow economic conditions, customer requested delays in shipments and the severe weather conditions that have impacted the majority of our galvanizing locations.
FORT WORTH, TX
Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are revising our previously issued revenue and earnings guidance for fiscal year 2010. Our current estimates are for revenues to be within the range of $350 million to $355 million and earnings are estimated to be within the range of $2.95 and $3.00.  The previous estimates were for earnings to be within the range of $3.00 to $3.10 and revenues to be in the range of $355 million to $365 million.  Our estimates assume that we will not have any further delays in the shipment of orders of our electrical and industrial products, or additional weather disruptions.

April 1, 2010  - AZZ incorporated (NYSE:AZZ), a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services today announced unaudited financial results for the three and twelve-month periods ended February 28, 2010. Revenues for the fourth quarter were $84.9 million, compared to $100.3 million, a decrease of 15 percent from the comparable period last year. Net income was $8 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, compared to net income of $10 million or $0.81 per diluted share, in last years fiscal fourth quarter.
FORT WORTH, TX
Backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $109.9 million, compared to $131.8 million at the end of the previous quarter and $174.8 million for the fourth quarter of last year.  Incoming orders for the fourth quarter totaled $62.9 million while shipments for the quarter totaled $84.9 million, resulting in a book to ship ratio of 74 percent for the quarter.  Based upon current customer requested delivery dates and our planned production schedule, 87 percent of our backlog is expected to ship in fiscal 2011.  Of our $109.9 million backlog, 47 percent is to be delivered outside of the U.S.
For the 2010 fiscal year, revenues decreased 13 percent to $357 million, compared to $412.4 million for the prior year. Net income for the year was $37.7 million, or $3.02 per diluted share, compared to $42.2 million, or $3.43 per diluted share for the comparable twelve-month period last year. Incoming orders for the twelve-month period were $292.1 million, while fiscal year revenues totaled $357 million, resulting in a book to ship ratio of 82 percent.
Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment were $48.9 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $59.9 million in the previous years fourth quarter, a decrease of 18 percent. Operating income for this segment was $9.1 million, compared to $10.8 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Operating income margins for the fourth quarter of 19 percent compare favorably to the margins of 18 percent in the prior year.  For the fiscal year ended February 28, 2010 revenues decreased 10 percent to $203.5 million and operating income was $40.8 million, compared to the $225.8 million and $39 million, respectively, in the prior fiscal year.  Operating income margins for the fiscal year improved to 20 percent from the margins of 17 percent in the prior fiscal year.

David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer, commented, Our fourth quarter incoming orders reflected a continuation of lower release of orders due to economic and regulatory uncertainty.  Additionally our fourth quarter historically has been a weaker quarter for incoming orders. While our quotation level continued at a pace that would historically result in a greater backlog, the release of orders for new and existing projects remained sluggish.  Based upon this quotation level and discussion with our customers, we do believe that the backlog has leveled and that we should begin to see some modest improvements in the new fiscal year.  We still believe that the prospects are somewhat healthier in the second half of our fiscal year.  Operationally we continued to effectively execute on our orders.  This is reflected in the strong margins for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year just completed.  As we go forward, we continue to monitor closely our market opportunities and our operating structure due to the changing and challenging market conditions.     Our challenge is to continue to succeed in our efforts to expand our served markets and increase our product offerings, while maintaining our strong operating performance and management of our cost/price ratios consistent with our historical practices.  As we have done in prior cycles, we believe this is an opportune time to add new products and services, whether through internal development or acquisition.  Additionally it is an excellent opportunity to further strengthen our organization and fine tune our operating procedures in order for us to be extremely well poised to capitalize on the improving long term demand for our products.
Revenues for the Companys Galvanizing Service Segment were $36 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $40.4 million in the previous years comparable quarter, a decrease of 11 percent. Operating income was $9.2 million in the fourth quarter as compared to $11.2 million in the same quarter last year.  Operating income margins for the fourth quarter were 26 percent versus 28 percent in same period last year.  For the fiscal year, revenues decreased 18 percent to $153.6 million and operating income was $44.8 million, compared to $186.6 million and $53.2 million, respectively, for the prior fiscal year.  Operating margins were 29 percent for fiscal 2010 unchanged from the 29 percent in the prior fiscal year.
Mr. Dingus continued, Shipments for the fiscal year decreased 11 percent and pricing was down 7 percent, again a reflection of economic conditions.  Demand for galvanizing services in the fourth quarter varied across our served markets and in addition to the economic downturn, we were adversely impacted by severe weather conditions in many of our locations during the fourth quarter.  These weather conditions impacted us and our customers thus lowering overall demand.  Despite the market volatility margins were extremely strong for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year.  As we look forward we believe that our markets will reflect modest improvement in our new fiscal year.  This market improvement combined with the benefits from the territory and customer expansion brought about by the proposed acquisition of North American Galvanizing, will enhance AZZs position as the market leader in this dynamic market.  The combined organizations galvanize in excess of 1 billion pounds of steel in the first full year of operation.  The effective execution of our business strategies, assimilation of acquisitions, capitalizing on our market opportunities, and strong margin performance has very positively contributed to our Fiscal 2010 results and should continue in the future.

The strength of our balance sheet should facilitate the execution of our business strategies for both segments of the company.
Mr. Dingus concluded, On January 15, 2010, the company issued projections for Fiscal 2011 that revenues would be in the range of $310 to $330 million and that fully diluted earnings per share would be in the range of $1.85 to $2.20.  Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, our revenue and earnings guidance remains unchanged from that issued in January.  Should we be successful in the completion of our proposed acquisition of North American Galvanizing, we will issue and revise our revenue and earnings guidance which would reflect the number of months of operation in the new fiscal year, and one time transaction and assimilation expenses.  The acquisition will be funded from AZZs cash on hand and its existing credit facility.  Incremental revenues for the first 12 months of consolidation of North American Galvanizing are expected to be in the range of $65 million to $75 million and we project that it will be accretive to earnings immediately. Exclusive of transaction and assimilation costs, we would anticipate that within the first twelve months of operation the EBIT would be in the range of $12 million to $15 million. Our estimates for our existing business and those projections for North American Galvanizing assume that we will not have any appreciable change in our current market conditions, significant delays in the delivery or timing in the receipt of orders of our electrical and industrial products, and that the pricing and demand for galvanizing services will not significantly change from our current outlook in fiscal 2011.
AZZ incorporated will conduct a conference call to discuss financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2010, and the acquisition of North American Galvanizing, at 11:00 A.M. Eastern on Monday April 5, 2010.  Interested parties can access the call at (800) 860-2442 or (412) 858-4600 (international). The call will be web cast via the Internet at .

Additionally, the Company announced that the Board of Directors, at its regularly scheduled quarterly meeting, declared 25 cents per share cash dividend on common stock outstanding.  The dividend will be paid at the close of business on April 30, 2010 to shareholders of record on April 15, 2010.

 David Dingus
- AZZ Incorporated - President, CEO
Thank you, Joe, and thanks to each of you for taking the time to join us for the conference call for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2010. Operating performance for the Company did approximate the guidance which had been previously issued. We are pleased with the operating results for the fiscal year and do believe it reflects a strong year giving due consideration to the economic and regulatory uncertainty that we have been operating in. Our fourth quarter incoming orders reflect a continuation of lower release of orders due to economic and regulatory uncertainty. Additionally our fourth quarter has historically been a weaker quarter for incoming orders. While our quotation level continued at a pace that would historically result in a greater backlog, the release of orders for new and existing product remains sluggish. Based upon this quotation level and discussion with our customers, we do believe that the backlog has leveled and that we should begin to see some modest improvements in the new fiscal year.
Operationally, we continue to effectively execute on our orders. This is reflective in the strong margin performance for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year just completed for both of our operating segments. We will continue to closely monitor our quotation activity and customer feedback which hopefully will allow us, in future quarters, to better forecast our incoming order rate and our backlog. Based upon customer current requested delivery dates and our production schedule, 87% of our backlog is expected to ship in the new fiscal year. Of the backlog of $109.9 million, 47% is to be delivered outside the United States. Demand for our Galvanizing Services continues to be adversely impacted by economic conditions. Shipments for the fiscal year decreased 11% and pricing was down 7%, again a reflection of the economic conditions. Demand for Galvanizing Services in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 varied across our served markets and in addition to the economic downturn, we were adversely impacted by the severe weather conditions in many of our locations.
As we look forward, we believe that our markets will reflect modest improvement in the second half of our new fiscal year. This market improvement, combined with the benefits from the territory and customer expansion brought about by the proposed acquisition of North American Galvanizing, will enhance AZZ's position as the domestic market leader in this dynamic market. The combined operations galvanize in excess of 1 billion pounds of steel each year.
Competitive pricing actions continue to be mixed in both segments and with some competitors deciding to maintain production and employment levels regardless of price and others deciding to follow a more disciplined approach. For the most part within our served markets, the industry has resisted massive price discounting despite reduced demand. As a Company our accomplishments have continued as we double and redouble our efforts to better position the Company for market recovery and regulatory clarity. We will strive to effectively and efficiently execute on the business that we do have. The completion of another successful strong operating quarter, the financial strength of the Company, and a great group of employees is reflected in our results and the confidence that we have in our future as a Company. We believe we are structured for sustainability as we continue to navigate through challenging waters in this period of market uncertainty and continue the execution of our strategies. Now with that as an overview of our results, Dana will now give us a review of the operating result the for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2010. Dana?
 
 
 Dana Perry

Thank you, David and I would also like to welcome each of you to our fourth quarter conference call and at this time I will review our unaudited consolidated results for the period ending February 28, 2010. For the fourth quarter, financial results remain strong during these adverse economic times. AZZ was able to record revenues for the quarter ending of $84.9 million as compared to $100.3 million in the prior year. Net income for the quarter was $8 million as compared to $10 million in the prior quarter a year ago, and diluted earnings per share was $0.64 on a comparative basis of $0.81 in the prior year period. Our book to ship ratio for the quarter was 74% and was 82% for the full year, ending the year with a backlog of $109.9 million which compares to our previous year-end backlog of $174.8 million.
In our Electrical Industrial segment we generated 57% of our revenues for the year, while our Galvanizing Services segment generated 43%. In our Electrical Industrial product segment, we recorded revenues for the quarter of $48.9 million as compared to prior year results of $59.9 million. The decreased revenues for the quarter were the result of lower order intake during the fiscal year and operating income for the year was $9.1 million as compared to $10.8 million in the prior. Our operating margins were 18.6% for the quarter on a comparative basis of 18.1% in the prior year period. Our operating margins improved again for the year are attributable to the leverage gained from our improved operating efficiencies and favorable commodity pricing.
Revenues in our Galvanizing segment for the quarter were $36 million compared to $40.4 million recorded in the fourth quarter of our prior fiscal year. Operating fourth quarter operating revenues were negatively impacted by the reduction in volumes of steel produced and the amount of approximately 3% and reduction in selling price of 9%. Operating income was 9.2% compared to 11.2% in our prior year fourth quarter.

Final Transcript
 
Operating margins for the quarter were 25.6% compared to 27.8% in the prior year. As we have indicated before the results of this segment, it has followed closely the conditions of Industrial sector for the general economy.
At this time I will cover some of our key cash flow and balance sheet items on a comparative basis. For the 12 month period, cash provided by operations was $82.6 million compared to $60.6 million in the prior year. Again our accounts receivable days remain strong at 53 days at the end of our fourth quarter as compared to 51 days at the end of our last fiscal year. Year-to-date capital improvements were made in the amount of $12 million and depreciation and amortization amounted to $17.5 million. Our excellent cash flows allowed us to pay a cash dividend during the quarter of $0.25 for the quarter. Our total outstanding bank debt at the end of the quarter and our fiscal year end remained at $100 million and our cash balance was $110.6 million. The strength of our balance sheet, strong cash position combined with excess to borrowings under our existing banking arrangements should facilitate the execution of our business strategies going forward. At this time, David will give us an overview of our two operating segments.
 
 David Dingus
- AZZ Incorporated - President, CEO
 
The industrial and petrochemical demand for our power distribution motor control centers significantly slowed in fiscal 2010 when compared to fiscal 2009. The timing of new projects and release of orders related to energy infrastructure, rebuilds, expansion and upgrades remains an issue and is impacting our incoming order rate. Concerns over the uncertainty of the anticipated regulatory and legislative changes have, in our opinion, lowered overall order rates.
Demand for our metal clad outdoor switch gear products saw further reduction in the fourth quarter. The utility budgetary spending levels have been reduced and we do not anticipate a strong increase in the new fiscal year. Most of the demand that drove our business over the past three years has been more for the replacement and upgrade rather than expansion, so we would anticipate that that would follow the trend in the future. Therefore, we believe it is a timing issue rather than a long term reduction in spending for the distribution substation market. Our high voltage transmission bus duct products quotation activity reflected good demand. The quotations are made up of multiple orders rather than one or two large international orders. Activity has improved over the last few weeks.
Overall, we believe the power generation market is relatively stable. Domestic emphasis on renewables such as wind and solar and environmental upgrades should continue to positively impact our market opportunities. We believe that further opportunities will develop once it is determined how carbons will be addressed by the regulatory agency. Our specialty lighting and tubular product sales have leveled off and we believe will see some modest improvement during the next few quarters.
For the Galvanizing Services segment, our strategy to provide a premium level of service and quality to our customers has continued and will continue as we resist downward pricing pressures. Operating results will be impacted in future periods if our announced price increases do not stick as a result of sluggish demand. We believe that the emphasis on infrastructure will have a positive impact on our business.
We feel our overall marketing strategies and customer services emphasis will be enhanced if we are successful in the acquisition of North American Galvanizing. This acquisition will increase our footprint, broaden our customer base, and increase the total facilities allowing us to provide a superior level of service and support to this total market. We are anxious to have the opportunity to assimilate the organization into ours. There remains concern over the impact of economic conditions and the timing of economic recoveries. Renewable energy projects, particularly solar, could provide some growth opportunities for Galvanizing as well. We continue to look for opportunities for further expansion.
In summary, the strong market performance of the fourth quarter and fiscal 2010 is most encouraging. Our primary concern, as we've shared with you and discussed previously, is the incoming order rate and the impact it has had on revenues and operating income in the current fiscal year of 2010 and what the continuing impact will be in our new fiscal 2011. Our products and services are extremely well positioned to benefit from any market improvements and/or increased infrastructure spending. Our lead times are shorter and should provide for more expeditious benefits of any improved market conditions. The timing of projects and release of orders will always have an impact on our quarterly recognition of bookings, backlog, revenues and earnings and will result in quarter to quarter fluctuation which may be greater than true changes in market demand and our competitive position and success.
Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, our guidance for 2011 remains unchanged from the revenue and earnings guidance that we issued in January. Should we be successful in the completion of our proposed acquisition of North American Galvanizing, we will issue and revise our guidance and earnings which will reflect the number of months of operation in the new fiscal year and the one-time transaction and assimilation expenses. The acquisition will be funded with cash on hand and our existing credit facility. Our forecast model for the incremental impact to North American Galvanizing for the first full 12 months of operation is for revenues to be in the range of $65
million $75 million and EBIT to be in the range of $12 million to $15 million all exclusive of any transaction and assimilation cost. We do anticipate it to be accretive immediately.
Additionally, the Company's Board of Directors declared $0.25 per share cash dividend on common stock outstanding. The dividend will be paid at the close of business on April 30, 2010, to the shareholders of record on April 15th, 2010. Fiscal 2010 was our 23rd consecutive year of profitability and the second best year in the history of the Company. The guidance for 2011 projects that we will achieve our 24th consecutive year of profitability. All of our estimates assume that we'll not have any appreciable change in our current market conditions, competitive activity, or significant delays in the delivery or timing of the receipt of orders of our Electrical Industrial products and demand for our Galvanizing Services. Again, thank you for your participation today and we would like to open it up for any questions that you may have at this time.

QUESTION AND ANSWER
 
 
Operator
 
 We will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from John Franzreb at Sidoti.
 
 
 John Franzreb
- Sidoti & Company - Analyst
 
 Good morning, David, Dana, and Joe.
 
 David Dingus
- AZZ Incorporated - President, CEO
 
 Good morning.
 
 
 John Franzreb
- Sidoti & Company - Analyst
 
 I guess my first question is could you just walk us through the rationale for going after NGA, why them, why now, what can you bring to the table that you think is different that's not being done there?
 
 
 David Dingus
- AZZ Incorporated - President, CEO
 
Okay, well, it all starts with the footprint, John. When you look at the -- how it lays out, it adds new geographic territory, and new customers. Now, even in those areas where we both service the market, it's a very distinctly different product and customer base. Taking for example, the Houston market, the North American facility, a very large facility handles all of the large structural market where our facility is more smaller and more specialized. So we have the opportunity there of increasing our market size without impeding upon their customer base nor ours, so both of them are very complimentary at that level. That's the case also in the DFW market and the case in other markets but we just believe that it gives us the opportunity.
Now, why and what we think we can do different, I think it's just on our historical track record. I think once we had a facility that is contiguous to where we are and expands our service territory, just enhances our ability to serve the customer in a superior fashion, and then also, naturally, when you have that many facilities, you have the benefit of paybacks for every good idea that you come up with every one location. So I think eliminating the corporate overhead associated with being a public Company as being now part of the AZZ will add incremental improvement in the earnings, as well as we're going to continue to push the envelope as to gain additional customers, gain additional acceptance and expand our presence in the new served market.
 
 
 John Franzreb
- Sidoti & Company - Analyst
 
 Now, David, does going after a galvanizing business of this size, does that kind of send a signal to us that you think there might be more pain in the electrical and industrial side of the market certainly in the near term? Is that the read to maybe there?
 
 
 David Dingus
- AZZ Incorporated - President, CEO

Final Transcript
 
No, I don't think I'd read that way at all, John. I think we've been equally aggressive on both sides. We've been attempting to acquire companies of this size and of this magnitude for both segments. We believe that we want to do that. We're going to continue to do that. It's just that we were fortunate enough to get this one closed before we could get anything to this point in the Electrical, but it should not and certainly is not a reflection of a change in our overall strategy, nor do we have any, as I've shared with you before, I don't have any concern about aggressively going after Electrical acquisition in this market. I just believe so strongly in the long term growth potential of that market that we wouldn't pass up an opportunity despite the current marketing conditions or the current status of the market. We would love to announce one of equal size the same day as we announced North America, and we can truly say our strategies have been implemented for that fiscal year.
 
 
 John Franzreb
- Sidoti & Company - Analyst
 
 Okay, one last question. You talked about quotation activity being strong in A&I, it seems like that's been the MO for quite some time. What's different now than three months ago?
 
 
 David Dingus
- AZZ Incorporated - President, CEO
 
It's just we've got more projects which the customer is coming to us and saying we finally got approval to proceed. They've been out there. It's not an astounding increase, but it's enough to say that we believe the decent in our backlog has slowed and began to level off and anything that does improve further is an increase in that. So it is just based upon the customer forecast, our closeness to the order, and what we believe in this market. We've been wrong before, we feel pretty good about this or I wouldn't have said it, but and it's going to take several quarters to add validity to my statement because my visibility in this market is pretty limited. I can only see out about 90 days. Not from a quote standpoint but from a customer committment standpoint, but it's broad based enough and it's not one order that we're looking at as we've done in the past that gives me the confidence to say that.
I surely hope that we aren't disappointed in that but it is just that because you're exactly right. I've commented on the quotation activities being good before and now I'm saying I believe it's going to start coming in now, and we feel pretty good about that in the first quarter as far as the 109.9 being a leveling point and starting to see improvement as we progress through the year and I hope that would be the case for the second quarter. As it stands right now, it appears that way.
 
 
 John Franzreb
- Sidoti & Company - Analyst
 
 Okay, great. Thanks a lot David.
 
 
 David Dingus
- AZZ Incorporated - President, CEO
 
 You bet, John.
 
 
Operator
 
 The next question comes from Ned Borland at Hudson Securities.
 
 
 Ned Borland
- Hudson Securities - Analyst
 
 Good morning. Just following up on the questions about NGA, financing, can you maybe ballpark at this point how much of the credit facilities you expect to draw on?
 
 
 David Dingus
- AZZ Incorporated - President, CEO

Final Transcript
 
 Well, essentially, there is a substantial cash balance on NGA's books, so we'll go into the line of credit 20 to 30 and then they will have 20 to 30 on hand and we sweep it right back. So at the end of the day, Ned, it's going to work out to be a net transactions pretty darn close to what our cash on hand is.
 
 Ned Borland
- Hudson Securities - Analyst
 
 Okay.
 
 David Dingus
- AZZ Incorporated - President, CEO
 
So the period that we're into the line of credit will be a short period of time. We have room to do that. Our banks are willing to increase that to go forward for other transactions, but it will be just a temporary movement to the line of credit. Once we get consolidated and get access to the cash on hand at North American will be pulled out, our line of credit will be reduced back down and we'll be tracking along pretty close to within $10 million of what our cash on hand is as of today.
 
 Ned Borland
- Hudson Securities - Analyst
 
Okay, and then within their operations it looks like their margins are a bit lower than yours. Is there anything structural about who they're serving and the geographies and customers that they're serving? Is there anything structural that prevents them from getting -- you being able to get their margins up to where yours are?
 
 
 David Dingus
- AZZ Incorporated - President, CEO
 
We don't believe so, Ned. It will take some time and everything else as it has in our other acquisition. Yes, is their mix of business different in some markets than ours, but overall, their customer base looks an awful lot like ours and I think it's just the benefit of having multiple facilities, multiple approaches. We can push the sales and marketing envelope as much as we have in our others. So I don't see anything structurally that should prohibit us from getting to the point that it will match, because like I say, we're taking out significant -- they're a public company and they are relatively small to be a public company and when you pull that out, that moves them pretty close to where we are. So to get further to our projection and get us up to where we are is not an insurmountable challenge.
 
 
 Ned Borland
- Hudson Securities - Analyst
 
 Okay, and then I noticed there was about a 9% decrease in Galvanizing pricing versus a year ago. Zinc has come back a little bit here. You have some price increases announced. Is that more a function of the increase in zinc or is demand perhaps getting a little bit better?
 
 
 David Dingus
- AZZ Incorporated - President, CEO
 
Well the announced price increases are a reflection of the zinc that we've increased costs that we have. Now, the prices that we announced, it takes time to get them to stick through the process. So our challenge in this down market is how do we continue to push that envelope because it is truly reflective of an anticipatory increase in our cost, as that increased cost of zinc flows through our bifold balance sheet. So our challenge is not over with, but we've had that challenge before and we've overcome it and I think we will again in this time frame.
 
 
 Ned Borland
- Hudson Securities - Analyst
 
Okay, and then finally, on the E&I segment, the backlog, as we think about going through the rest of this fiscal year or I should say the fiscal year, first quarter are we kind of anticipated not much of a change, kind of a stable backlog? And then what gives you the confidence that in the second half of the year you're going to see it pick up? Are there some international projects out there that you have your eye on or is it just what you're hearing from your customers?

Yes, there are some significant, but I don't think our international -- but I don't think our confidence is coming from there. The confidence is coming from just in creased confidence of our customers that they're going to progress and if you'd look at the markets, the ones where we've not seen any improvement is the general Industrial and the petrochemical market, but our transmission markets in pretty good shape. I commented on the distribution is still struggling with utility budgets. Power generation is in pretty good shape, so I think that we'll be more into stopping the descent in the first and second quarter and optimistic that we're going to see something helping us out in the third and fourth quarter. There's enough pending projects and there's enough out there that could be released. As I said in the utility side and the power generation side we really need a resolution on how carbon is going to be addressed and the impact that it has on the production of electrical power, but I don't -- I'm not pointing to a particularly large international order when I say our confidence is improving.

 Our next question comes from Fred Buonocore at CJS Securities.
 
 Fred Buonocore
- CJS Securities - Analyst
 
 Yes, good morning.
 
 
 David Dingus
- AZZ Incorporated - President, CEO
 
 Good morning.
 
 
 Fred Buonocore
- CJS Securities - Analyst
 
 Just following up on Ned's question about international orders, can you address kind the trend there with competition by large international players in the China market and if those competitive pressures have eased or you're not sure yet?
 
 
 David Dingus
- AZZ Incorporated - President, CEO
 
Well I think for the most part, they've leveled off. We had that very severe period where -- I think it was the second quarter of last year where some of the large orders just went for ridiculously low prices. What we have seen I would say over the last four to five months tells us that while competition is still pricing somewhat below us, it's not to the degree that we don't have the chance to sell the benefits of our program. So I think there's a little more stability there. Could it raise its head again? Absolutely because as I've said before, some of these large orders just get a profile difference that causes some large competitors to go after it, but in total it's a much better environment than it was this time last year.
 
 
 Fred Buonocore
- CJS Securities - Analyst
 
Got it, and just in terms of the pool of those larger size transmission orders, do you think as we move through fiscal 2011 they will be kind of similar number or maybe an increase of number of opportunities there realizing that you're not putting your thought that backlog is going to bounce back or come back in the second half of the year in a large international order and do you see that as a decent opportunity as we move through the year?

 David Dingus

We don't really expect any orders the size of the ones that cause the pricing problems to rise, which was as I've shared with you, was a very high number. What we see projects in the $5 million to $10 million range? Yes, we're working on those on a continual basis. I don't think we're going to see the $30 million and the $40 million opportunities that lead to some of the price issues in our last fiscal year, but like I said, it's spreading itself around and we think that's a good thing for AZZ. You never want to see a diminishing of those very large orders, but the more that we put out there in that mid range and from the $2.5 million to $10 million, we are very happy when we see a whole lot of those rather than one $30 million one.
 
 
 Fred Buonocore
- CJS Securities - Analyst
 
Understood, and then turning to the domestic market, I've been hearing various commentary from some of your peers and customers as it relates to impact of environmental regulation, which you could kind of put in the bucket of an overhang right now on your business and various degrees of some companies saying it's a major overhang right now to some saying well it's probably overblown. Where do you really see -- you mentioned generation. Where else do you really see concerns over environmental regulation impacting decisions to make orders and what's it going to take to make those go away?
 
 
 David Dingus
- AZZ Incorporated - President, CEO
 
Well, I think the number one thing it's going to take is a position, as I've said, on carbon and power generation. Once we know what the cost is for the production of electrical power from coal going forward, then it makes it much easier exercise as to whether you're going to go forward with renewables or non-carbon such as nuclear power. There are always issues in the petrochemical market that can drive them, but I don't think they're of the significant level. I think the major one that is out there, fortunately I think the administration has shown a more positive hand with their guarantees of loans in the nuclear industry. I think that what they've done in the wind and what's proposed to be done in the solar is good, but at the end of the day all of those cost more to produce than coal and until you put a carbon tax or some kind of program on to make coal equal, I don't think you ever go forward on the alternatives.
 
 
 Fred Buonocore
- CJS Securities - Analyst
 
 Okay, and then finally, relative to that, you've talked about solar being a potential driver for both of your segments. Are there actually solar projects that you have in your backlog that you're executing on now?
 
 David Dingus
- AZZ Incorporated - President, CEO
 
 Yes, we do.
 
 Fred Buonocore
- CJS Securities - Analyst
 
 And do you expect that to grow? There are ones that you're working on booking or quoting on at the moment.
 
 David Dingus
- AZZ Incorporated - President, CEO
 
 The potential is greater than what we're currently doing.
 
 
 Fred Buonocore
- CJS Securities - Analyst
 
 Very good. Thank you very much.

 (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Brent Thielman at DA Davidson.
 Brent Thielman
- DA Davidson - Analyst
 
 Hi, good morning.
 
 David Dingus
- AZZ Incorporated - President, CEO
 
 Good morning.
 
 Brent Thielman
- DA Davidson - Analyst
 
 Yes, just a question on the revenue guidance for Galvanizing. As you're starting to think about the growth in that business for fiscal 2010, are you seeing that more back half weighted or are you already starting to see positive comparisons there?
 
 David Dingus
- AZZ Incorporated - President, CEO
 
No, I think it is back half impacted, okay? But that confidence comes from our customers starting to see currently some improved activity, because it's going to get in our customers backlog long before we galvanize it. So our confidence and optimism of the last part of the year is being driven by current awards of orders to our existing customer base, so -- but we're not seeing it yet, but we welcome when our customers are seeing it in the backlog, it's just a matter of time before we feel the benefit of it.
 
 
 Brent Thielman
- DA Davidson - Analyst
 
Okay, and then just a question on Electrical and in terms of bidding activity and what you're seeing out of competitors and how are people responding to some of the moves we've seen in raw material prices, copper, steel, etc. Has there been any significant terms of change in any significant bidding practices in that business?
 
 
 David Dingus
- AZZ Incorporated - President, CEO
 
No, I don't think there has. We've been continuing with it of the same approach. Everybody knows the volatility of it. Everybody wants the benefit of the downturn and doesn't want to pay for the upturn, but that's something we've been dealing with for 20 years. So I don't think the environment has changed.
 Brent Thielman
- DA Davidson - Analyst
 
Okay, do you think some of the sharp moves you've seen have stalled projects? Are owners waiting to see things level out?
 
 
 David Dingus
- AZZ Incorporated - President, CEO
 
 I can't point to anything they have told us that is the reason there is a delay.
 
 Brent Thielman
- DA Davidson - Analyst
 
 Okay, and then just lastly, with respect to Galvanizing, obviously a couple of big acquisitions with Valmont announcing with Delta and now you with North American Galvanizing. Pending these are completed, do you see any material changes in terms of the price and dynamics of the industry?
9
Final Transcript
 
 
 David Dingus
- AZZ Incorporated - President, CEO
 
Well, we're both, Delta is a sophisticated player and North American is a public sophisticated player. I think it's good for the industry and we're pleased with that, but I don't think it's like a public company taking over a large private, as we did with AAA or some of the others. Delta has published results for their acquisition after Galvanizing activity as does North American as does Valmont, as does AZZ. So I think you've got a consolidation of the four strongest players in the market.
 Brent Thielman
- DA Davidson - Analyst
 
 Okay.
 
 David Dingus
- AZZ Incorporated - President, CEO
 
In terms of performance, okay? And it's not as easy to discern the US activity on Hill & Smith, but they are a growing aggressive public company also. So I think overall, it's good for the industry. I think this merger between ourselves and North American and Valmont and Delta is not a really that significant in terms of the performance. I think it is great for customer service.
 
 
 Brent Thielman
- DA Davidson - Analyst
 
 Okay, thank you.
 
 David Dingus

 Thank you.

 Our next question comes from Eric Prouty at Canaccord Adams.
 
 Eric Prouty
- Canaccord Adams - Analyst
 
 Thanks a lot. Just a quick question on North American in any potential cost savings there to be had as far as raw material goes on the zinc side, any way of pushing down premium to LME or does that tend to be pretty fixed across-the-board?
 
 
 David Dingus
- AZZ Incorporated - President, CEO
 
Well, we all start with the LME price and then yes we do pay a premium on that. Any time that you are larger you can argue more, but that's the small its piece of the puzzle, but we have not built into our projections nor do we think there's really any appreciable change in the net cost of zinc to the North American operations as compared to us. We hope that we're getting the best deal on the premium from our size, but that would be a penny or two in the total cycle. So if you're paying $1.05 or so, a penny adds up, don't get me wrong, and we push for it but I don't think it's appreciable.
 
 Eric Prouty
- Canaccord Adams - Analyst
 
Sure, okay, and then just in the industry in general on the Galvanizing side and you might have touched on this already, but with now some of your clients having a little better outlook, can you parse out end markets where you might be seeing a bit more strength in end markets where they've continued to lag, where you see continued weakness?
10
 
 David Dingus
- AZZ Incorporated - President, CEO
 
We're still working ourselves through that analysis. Naturally, we haven't seen as much improvement on the petrochemical as we would like, but the general Industrial projects are showing some like. So I'm going to reserve comment on that until we get a little better feel as we move forward and I'll certainly update that at the end of the first quarter.
 
 Eric Prouty
- Canaccord Adams - Analyst
 
 Fair enough. Thanks.
 
 David Dingus
- AZZ Incorporated - President, CEO
 
 Thank you.

 This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Dingus for any closing remarks.
 
 
 David Dingus
- AZZ Incorporated - President, CEO
 
Again, we appreciate the opportunity to meet -- to discuss this with you today. I know there was a number of calls from a number of people on Thursday after the announcement and to address some of the things the same things that have been addressed to date, but we welcome the opportunity and hopefully the next time we chat we will have this acquisition completed as well as a better outlook on the Electrical and Industrial backlog. Thank you and have a great day.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
Section 7-Regulation FD
 
 
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 are materials to be used by representatives of AZZ incorporated, a Texas corporation (the Company), in future presentations to the financial community.
Pursuant to General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K, shall not be deemed to be filed for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.
The information contained herein is summary information that is intended to be considered in the context of our SEC filings and other public announcements that we may make, by press release or otherwise, from time to time.
The Company undertakes no duty or obligation to publicly update or revise the information contained in this report, although the Company may do so from time to time as management of the Company believes is warranted. Any such updating may be made through the filing of other reports or documents with the SEC, through press releases or through other public disclosure.
In connection with such future presentations to the financial community, reconciliations between EBITDA (as defined below) and net income and between Free Cash Flow (as define below) to cash provided by operating activities are provided as follows. As used by the Company, these terms may differ from similarly captioned measures used by other companies.
EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  The Company presents EBITDA because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization, many of which present EBITDA when reporting their results.  The Company also uses EBITDA for the following purposes: (1) the Companys credit agreement uses EBITDA to measure compliance with covenants, such as fixed charge coverage and debt incurrence; (2) EBITDA is also used by potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions with the Company; and (3) EBITDA is also used by the Company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  Some of these limitations are: (a) EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Companys working capital needs, (b) EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Companys debts; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures.  Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Companys performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using EBITDA only on a supplemental basis.
Free Cash Flow (FCF), also a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash disbursed for capital expenditures excluding acquisitions.  The Company presents FCF because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization to the Company, many of which present FCF when reporting their results.
FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  These limitations include that FCF excludes significant cash flows, such as principal payments on debt.  Because of these limitations, FCF should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Companys performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using FCF only on a supplemental basis.

SECTION 2  FINANCIAL INFORMATION
 
Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
 
On March 31, 2010, AZZ incorporated, a Texas corporation ("AZZ"), and Big Kettle Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of AZZ ("Purchaser"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with North American Galvanizing & Coatings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("NGA"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Purchaser commenced a tender offer (the "Offer") on May 7, 2010 for all of NGA's outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share (the "NGA Common Stock"), at a purchase price of $7.50 per share in cash, without interest (less any applicable withholding taxes) (the "Offer Price"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated May 7, 2010, and the related Letter of Transmittal.
 
The Offer expired at 5:00 p.m., Central Daylight Saving Time, on June 14, 2010 (the "Expiration Time"). Based on information from the depositary, as of the Expiration Time, a total of approximately
12,900,591
shares of NGA Common Stock were validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer. The depositary also advised that an additional approximately 117,395 shares of NGA Common Stock were tendered subject to guaranteed delivery procedures. These shares of NGA Common Stock (together with (x) the shares of NGA Common Stock beneficially owned by AZZ, Purchaser or their respective subsidiaries and (y) the shares of NGA Common Stock that are issuable upon exercise of options, that are held in trust pursuant to NGA's Director Stock Unit Program or that constitute restricted shares, in each case which the Purchaser has an option to purchase), represent approximately 83% of NGA's outstanding shares of Company Common Stock determined on a fully diluted basis. The number of shares of NGA Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer satisfies certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. All shares of NGA Common Stock that were validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn have been accepted for payment, and Purchaser will pay for all such shares of NGA Common Stock promptly. On June 14, 2010, AZZ issued a press release, which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference, announcing the successful completion of the Offer.
 
The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that following the consummation of the Offer and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law, Purchaser will merge with and into NGA (the "Merger") and each share of NGA Common Stock not acquired in the Offer will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Offer Price (other than shares of NGA Common Stock held in the treasury of NGA or owned by AZZ, Purchaser or any of their subsidiaries, and shares of NGA Common Stock held by stockholders who properly demand appraisal rights). Following the effective time of the Merger, NGA will continue as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of AZZ. The closing of the Merger is subject to approval by holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of NGA Common Stock entitled to vote at a meeting of the stockholders of NGA, voting together as a single class. As a result of the number of shares of NGA Common Stock tendered in the Offer, Purchaser holds a sufficient number of shares of NGA Common Stock such that the vote of any other stockholder of NGA will not be required to approve the Merger. The foregoing summary description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to AZZ's Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 1, 2010 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
AZZ's acquisition of NGA Common Stock accepted for payment in the Offer and tendered in the Offer subject to guaranteed delivery procedures is valued at approximately $97.6 million, which value does not include the acquisition of (x) shares of NGA Common Stock that will be cancelled and exchanged for the Offer Price in the Merger or (y) shares of NGA Common Stock that are issuable upon exercise of options, that are held in trust pursuant to NGA's Director Stock Unit Program or that constitute restricted shares, in each case which the Purchaser has an option to purchase. AZZ funded this acquisition with its available working capital and funds available under its existing credit facility.
 
Cautionary Note Regarding the Merger Agreement
 
 
The Merger Agreement has been included to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about AZZ, Purchaser or NGA. In particular, the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement were made only for the purposes of the Merger Agreement as of the specific dates therein and were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement.
 
2
 
 
The representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the parties to the Merger Agreement and are qualified by information in confidential disclosure schedules provided by NGA in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement. These confidential disclosure schedules contain information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, certain representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement may be subject to a standard of materiality provided for in the Merger Agreement and have been used for the purpose of allocating risk among NGA, AZZ and Purchaser, rather than establishing matters of fact. Information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may also change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may not be fully disclosed in the parties' public disclosures. Accordingly, the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement may not constitute the actual state of facts about NGA, AZZ or Purchaser. Investors are not third party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or conditions of NGA, AZZ or Purchaser, or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.

Revenues for the first quarter were $77.5 million compared to $95.5 million for the same quarter last year, a decrease of 19 percent. Net income for the quarter was $6.4 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, compared to net income of $9.9 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, in last years first fiscal quarter.

Incoming orders for the first quarter were $78.6 million while shipments for the quarter totaled $77.5 million, resulting in a book to ship ratio of 101 percent.    Based upon current customer requested delivery dates and our production schedules, 75 percent of the backlog at May 31, 2010 is expected to ship in the current fiscal year.  Of the backlog of $111.0 million, 41 percent is to be delivered outside of the U.S.

David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of AZZ incorporated, commented, Based upon our quotation activity and conversations with our customers, we do believe that our backlog and business levels continue to show signs of stabilizing.  Effective execution on all our opportunities, expansion of domestic and international markets, successful assimilation of acquisitions, and seeking out of additional product and market opportunities to further enhance our strategic position will continue to be the focus and emphasis of our activities.
Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are revising our fiscal year 2011 guidance for revenues to be in the range of $380 million to $395 million.  Our earnings guidance is revised and anticipated to be within the range of $2.65 to $2.80.  The revised guidance includes the anticipated results of the acquisition of North American Galvanizing for nine months.  The previously issued guidance was for revenues to be in the range of $310 million to $330 million and that fully diluted earnings per share would be in the range of $1.85 to $2.20.  We will incur additional acquisition related expenses during the balance of FY 2011 of approximately $1 million, which are reflected in the guidance.  We do not expect to fully realize all synergistic benefits of the North American Galvanizing acquisition until the first quarter of FY 2012.
Additionally, the Company announced that the Board of Directors, at its regularly scheduled quarterly meeting, declared a 25 cent per share cash dividend on the Companys common stock outstanding.  The dividend with be paid at the close of business on July 26, 2010, to shareholders of record on July 9, 2010.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
Section 7-Regulation FD
 
 
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 are materials to be used by representatives of AZZ incorporated, a Texas corporation (the Company), in future presentations to the financial community.
Pursuant to General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K, shall not be deemed to be filed for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.
The information contained herein is summary information that is intended to be considered in the context of our SEC filings and other public announcements that we may make, by press release or otherwise, from time to time.
The Company undertakes no duty or obligation to publicly update or revise the information contained in this report, although the Company may do so from time to time as management of the Company believes is warranted. Any such updating may be made through the filing of other reports or documents with the SEC, through press releases or through other public disclosure.
In connection with such future presentations to the financial community, reconciliations between EBITDA (as defined below) and net income and between Free Cash Flow (as define below) to cash provided by operating activities are provided as follows. As used by the Company, these terms may differ from similarly captioned measures used by other companies.
EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  The Company presents EBITDA because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization, many of which present EBITDA when reporting their results.  The Company also uses EBITDA for the following purposes: (1) the Companys credit agreement uses EBITDA to measure compliance with covenants, such as fixed charge coverage and debt incurrence; (2) EBITDA is also used by potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions with the Company; and (3) EBITDA is also used by the Company to eval uate and price potential acquisition candidates.
EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  Some of these limitations are: (a) EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Companys working capital needs, (b) EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Companys debts; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures.  Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Company ;s performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using EBITDA only on a supplemental basis.
Free Cash Flow (FCF), also a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash disbursed for capital expenditures excluding acquisitions.  The Company presents FCF because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization to the Company, many of which present FCF when reporting their results.
FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  These limitations include that FCF excludes significant cash flows, such as principal payments on debt.  Because of these limitations, FCF should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Companys performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using FCF only on a supplemental basis.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements are not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of operations or financial condition of AZZ that would have been reported had the acquisition been completed as of the dates presented and should not be taken as representative of the future consolidated results of operations or financial condition of AZZ.  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined c onsolidated financial statements do not reflect any operating efficiencies and/or cost savings that AZZ may achieve with respect to the combined companies.
AZZ and NGA have different fiscal year ends.  Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2010 combines AZZ's historical unaudited consolidated condensed balance sheet as of May 31, 2010 and NGA's historical unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2010 and is presented as if the acquisition of NGA had occurred on May 31, 2010.  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statement of earnings for the three months ended May 31, 2010 combines the unaudited historical results of AZZ for the three months ended May 31, 2010 and the unaudited historical results of NGA for the three months ended March 31, 2010.  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statement of earnings for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2010 combines the historical results of AZZ for the year ended February 28, 2010 and the historical results of NGA for the year ended December 31, 2009.  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statements of earnings are presented as if the acquisition had occurred on March 1, 2009.
The acquisition of NGA has been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting.  Accordingly, the total estimated purchase price, calculated as described in Note 1 to these unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements, has been allocated on a preliminary basis to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition based on their estimated fair values as of the completion of the acquisition.  These allocations reflect various preliminary estimates and analyses, including preliminary work performed by third-party valuation specialists, and are subject to change during the purchase price allocation period (generally one year from the acquisition date) as valuations are finalized.
We will consolidate the general and administration function of NGA with AZZ.  The NGA corporate office in Tulsa will be closed and certain positions will be relocated to other AZZ facilities.  The majority of the General & Administrative costs associated with NGA will be eliminated.  This transition is anticipated to be completed by December 2010.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with AZZ's historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in AZZ's Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended February 28, 2010 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for its quarter ended May 31, 2010 and NGA's historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in NGA's Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for its quarter ended March 31, 2010, which are included as Exhibits 99.2 and 99.1, respectively, to this Form 8-K/A.

results for the three and six-month periods ended August 31, 2010, which includes the acquisition of North American Galvanizing effective June 14, 2010. Revenues for the second quarter were $99.6 million compared to $95.2 million for the same quarter last year, an increase of 5 percent. Net income for the second quarter was $9.6 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, compared to net income of $11.1 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, in last years second fiscal quarter.  The expenses related to the acquisition of North American Galvanizing since June 14, 2010, adversely impacted second quarter earnings by $0.03 per diluted share.  Without these expenses, the second quarter earnings would have been $0.80 per diluted share.
For the six-month period, the Company reported revenues of $177.1 million compared to $190.6 million for the comparable period last year, a decrease of 7 percent.  Net income for the six months was $16 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, compared to $21 million, or $1.69 per diluted share in the comparable period of last year.  For the first six months, expenses related to the acquisition of North American Galvanizing adversely impacted earnings per diluted share by $0.09.
Backlog at the end of our second quarter was $106.5 million. Backlog at the end of the second quarter of FY 2010 was $139.4 million and $109.9 million at February 28, 2010.  Incoming orders for the second quarter were $95 million while shipments for the quarter totaled $99.6 million, resulting in a book to ship ratio of 95 percent. Based upon current customer requested delivery dates and our production schedules, 65 percent of the backlog at August 31, 2010 is expected to ship in the current fiscal year.  Of the backlog of $106.5 million, 38 percent is to be delivered outside of the U.S.
Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment for the second quarter of FY 2011 were $40.8 million as compared to $55.6 million for the same quarter last year, a decrease of 27 percent.  Operating income for the segment decreased 38 percent to $7.5 million compared to $12.1 million in the same period last year.  Operating margins for the second quarter were 19 percent.     For the first six months, revenues decreased 30 percent to $77.9 million and operating income decreased 37 percent to $14.1 million compared to $111 million and $22.6 million respectively, for the first six months of the prior year.  Operating margin for the first six months was 18 percent.

Revenues for the Companys Galvanizing Service Segment for the second quarter were $58.8 million, compared to the $39.6 million in the same period last year, an increase of 49 percent.  The acquisition of North American Galvanizing accounted for 79 percent of the increase.  Operating income was $15.2 million as compared to $12.3 million in the prior period, an increase of 24 percent. The acquisition of North American Galvanizing contributed $3.5 million of the operating income. Tonnage shipped increased 49 percent when compared to the prior period. Operating margins for the second quarter were 26 percent, compared to 31 percent in the same period last year. For the six months of Fiscal 2011, revenues increased 24 percent to $99.1 million and operating income increased 6 percent to $26.7 million compared to $79 .7 miilion and $25.1 million, respectively, for the first six months of the prior year.  Operating margins were 27 percent compared to 31.5 percent in the prior period.  The contribution for the first six months from the acquisition of North American Galvanizing was $15.1 million in revenues and $3.5 million in operating income.
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of AZZ incorporated, commented, The second quarter was another quarter of effective execution of our opportunities and we are pleased with the positive impact and the assimilation of North American Galvanizing.  The markets for our Electrical and Industrial Products have not shown the level of stability or the recovery that we had anticipated.  Based upon our quotation activity and conversations with our customers, we do not believe that our backlog will show appreciable increases in the current fiscal year.  We are continuing our efforts to identify additional product and market opportunities for growth and enhance our strategic position.
Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are revising our fiscal year 2011 guidance for revenues to be in the range of $385 million to $395 million.  Our earnings guidance is revised and anticipated to be within the range of $2.70 to $2.85 per diluted share.  The revised guidance includes the anticipated results of the acquisition of North American Galvanizing which was completed on June 14, 2010.  The previously issued guidance was for revenues to be in the range of $380 million to $395 million and that fully diluted earnings per share would be in the range of $2.65 to $2.80.  We do not expect to fully realize all synergistic benefits of the North American Galvanizing acquisition until the first quarter of FY 2012.
Additionally, the Company announced that the Board of Directors, at its regularly scheduled quarterly meeting, declared a 25 cent per share cash dividend on the Companys common stock outstanding.  The dividend will be paid at the close of business on November 1, 2010, to shareholders of record on October 15, 2010.
AZZ incorporated will conduct a conference call to discuss financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 at 4:30 P.M. ET on Thursday, September 30, 2010.  Interested parties can access the conference call by dialing (877) 317-6789 or (412) 317-6789 (international). The call will be web cast via the Internet at .

Section 7-Regulation FD
 
 
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 are materials to be used by representatives of AZZ incorporated, a Texas corporation (the Company), in future presentations to the financial community.
Pursuant to General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K, shall not be deemed to be filed for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.
The information contained herein is summary information that is intended to be considered in the context of our SEC filings and other public announcements that we may make, by press release or otherwise, from time to time.
The Company undertakes no duty or obligation to publicly update or revise the information contained in this report, although the Company may do so from time to time as management of the Company believes is warranted. Any such updating may be made through the filing of other reports or documents with the SEC, through press releases or through other public disclosure.
In connection with such future presentations to the financial community, reconciliations between EBITDA (as defined below) and net income and between Free Cash Flow (as define below) to cash provided by operating activities are provided as follows. As used by the Company, these terms may differ from similarly captioned measures used by other companies.
EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  The Company presents EBITDA because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization, many of which present EBITDA when reporting their results.  The Company also uses EBITDA for the following purposes: (1) the Companys credit agreement uses EBITDA to measure compliance with covenants, such as fixed charge coverage and debt incurrence; (2) EBITDA is also used by potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions with the Company; and (3) EBITDA is also used by the Company to eval uate and price potential acquisition candidates.
EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  Some of these limitations are: (a) EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Companys working capital needs, (b) EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Companys debts; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures.  Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Company ;s performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using EBITDA only on a supplemental basis.
Free Cash Flow (FCF), also a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash disbursed for capital expenditures excluding acquisitions.  The Company presents FCF because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization to the Company, many of which present FCF when reporting their results.
FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  These limitations include that FCF excludes significant cash flows, such as principal payments on debt.  Because of these limitations, FCF should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Companys performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using FCF only on a supplemental basis.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 - AZZ incorporated , a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services, today announced unaudited financial results for the three and nine-month periods ended November 30, 2010, which includes the acquisition of North American Galvanizing effective June 14, 2010. Revenues for the third quarter were $102.9 million compared to $81.5 million for the same quarter last year, an increase of 26 percent. Net income for the third quarter was $9.7 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, compared to net income of $8.7 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, in last years third fiscal quarter.
January 7, 2011
FORT WORTH, TX
(NYSE:AZZ)
For the nine-month period, the Company reported revenues of $280.0 million compared to $272.2 million for the comparable period last year, an increase of 3 percent.  Net income for the nine months was $25.7 million, or $2.04 per diluted share, compared to $29.8 million, or $2.39 per diluted share in the comparable period of last year.  For the first nine months, expenses related to the acquisition of North American Galvanizing adversely impacted earnings per diluted share by $0.09.
Backlog at the end of our third quarter was $101.7 million. Backlog at the end of the third quarter of FY 2010 was $131.8 million and $109.9 million at February 28, 2010.  Incoming orders for the third quarter were $98.1 million while shipments for the quarter totaled $102.9 million, resulting in a book to ship ratio of 95 percent. Based upon current customer requested delivery dates and our production schedules, 40 percent of the backlog at November 30, 2010 is expected to ship in the current fiscal year.  Of the backlog of $101.7 million, 40 percent is to be delivered outside of the U.S.
Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment for the third quarter of FY 2011 were $41.1 million as compared to $43.6 million for the same quarter last year, a decrease of 6 percent.  Operating income for the segment decreased 32 percent to $6.2 million compared to $9.1 million in the same period last year.  Operating margins for the third quarter were 15 percent compared to 21 percent in the same period last year. For the first nine months, revenues decreased 23 percent to $119 million and operating income decreased 36 percent to $20.3 million compared to $154.6 million and $31.7 million respectively.  Operating margins for the first nine months was 17 percent compared to 21 percent in the same period last year.

Revenues for the Companys Galvanizing Service Segment for the third quarter were $61.8 million, compared to the $37.9 million in the same period last year, an increase of 63 percent.  The acquisition of North American Galvanizing accounted for $18.3 million of the increase in revenues.  Operating income was $15.4 million as compared to $10.5 million in the prior period, an increase of 46 percent. The acquisition of North American Galvanizing contributed $4.5 million of the operating income. Tonnage shipped increased 58 percent when compared to the prior period. Operating margins for the third quarter were 25 percent, compared to 28 percent in the same period last year. For the nine months of Fiscal 2011, revenues increased 37 percent to $161 million and operating income increased 18 percent to $42.1 million c ompared to $117.6 million and $35.6 million respectively, for the first nine months of the prior year.  Operating margins were 26 percent compared to 30 percent in the prior period.  The contribution for the first nine months from the acquisition of North American Galvanizing was $33.4 million in revenues and $8 million in operating income.
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of AZZ incorporated, commented, The third quarter was another quarter of effective execution of our opportunities and we continue to be very pleased with the positive impact and the assimilation of North American Galvanizing.  We are pleased that the revenues and operating income exceeded those for the same period last year.  The markets for our galvanizing services have continued to show improvement.  However, the markets for our electrical and industrial products have not shown the level of stability or the recovery that we had anticipated.   Utility spending levels need to increase for us to see a measurable improvement.  We continue our efforts to identify additional product and market opportunities that will add growth and enhance our strategic position.
The Company anticipates entering into an additional Note Purchase Agreement in January of 2011 pursuant to which the Company would issue $125 million aggregate principal amount unsecured Senior Notes due in January of 2021 at a fixed rate of 5.42 percent, through a private placement.  The Company anticipates using the proceeds from the 2011 Note Offering for possible future acquisitions, working capital needs, capital improvements and future dividend payments.
Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, the companys issued projections for Fiscal 2011, that revenues would be in the range of $385 to $395 million and that fully diluted earnings per share would be in the range of $2.70 to $2.85, remains unchanged. We do not expect to fully realize all synergistic benefits of the North American Galvanizing acquisition until the first quarter of FY 2012.
AZZ incorporated will conduct a conference call to discuss financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 at 11:00 A.M. ET on Friday, January 7, 2011.

EX 99.1
 
January 21, 2011  - AZZ incorporated (NYSE: AZZ), a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services, today announced revenue and earnings guidance for Fiscal Year 2012.  Fiscal Year 2012 refers to the 12 month period beginning March 1, 2011 and ending on February 29, 2012.
FORT WORTH, TX
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of the company, stated, Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are projecting our 25th consecutive year of profitability. Our earnings are estimated to be within the range of $2.70 and $3.05 per diluted share, and revenues are estimated to be within the range of $425 to $450 million. We continue to build upon the success we have been able to achieve over the past decade, and continually strive to further enhance the performance of the Company. Our guidance does include the increased interest expense of $0.34 per diluted share associated with the $125 million of Senior Private Placement Notes issued on January 20, 2011.  Our funded debt at the end of fiscal year 2011 is expected to be $225 million and our cash on hand is antic ipated to be between $140 and $150 million. Electrical revenues are projected to be up slightly.  Due to pricing pressures that began in the current fiscal year and are expected to continue into the new fiscal year, margins in the Electrical Segment will continue to be compressed and should be in the range of 13 to 15 percent. The Galvanizing Services Segment revenues are projected to be up due both to organic growth and the full year impact of the North American Galvanizing acquisition.  Margins for this Segment should remain strong, and should be in the range of 25 to 27 percent.  It is anticipated that 60 percent of our revenues will be derived from the Galvanizing Services Segment and 40 percent from the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment.  Further information is provided in our Form 8-K filed on January 21, 2011.
 
Mr. Dingus continued, Our next, regularly scheduled quarterly conference call is in April 2011, where we will be reporting the operating results for the fourth quarter and 2011 fiscal year.  We are continuing our efforts to seek out growth and expansion opportunities.  The strength of our balance sheet and cash position fully supports this strategy.  The company is well positioned to capitalize on improving market conditions, in both segments.
 
 
 
AZZ incorporated is a specialty electrical equipment manufacturer serving the global markets of industrial, power generation, transmission and distributions, as well as a leading provider of hot dip galvanizing services to the steel fabrication market nationwide.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 - AZZ incorporated , a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services, today announced unaudited financial results for the three and twelve-month periods ended February 28, 2011, which includes the acquisition of North American Galvanizing & Coatings, Inc. (North American Galvanizing) effective June 14, 2010. Revenues for the fourth quarter were $100.7 million compared to $84.9 million for the same quarter last year, an increase of 19 percent. Net income for the fourth quarter was $9.2 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, compared to net income of $8.0 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, in last years fourth fiscal quarter.
April 7, 2011
FORT WORTH, TX
(NYSE:AZZ)
For the twelve-month period, the Company reported revenues of $380.6 million compared to $357.0 million for the comparable period last year, an increase of 7 percent.  Net income for the twelve months was $35 million, or $2.77 per diluted share, compared to $37.7 million, or $3.02 per diluted share in the comparable period of last year.  For the current twelve months, expenses related to the acquisition of North American Galvanizing adversely impacted earnings per diluted share by $0.10.
Backlog at the end of our fourth quarter was $108.4 million. Backlog at the end of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010 was $109.9 million.  Incoming orders for the fourth quarter were $107.4 million while shipments for the quarter totaled $100.7 million, resulting in a book to ship ratio of 107 percent. The company will deliver 34 percent of the $108.4 backlog outside of the U.S.
Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 were $43.6 million as compared to $48.9 million for the same quarter last year, a decrease of 11 percent.  Operating income for the segment decreased 26 percent to $6.7 million compared to $9.1 million in the same period last year.  Operating margins for the fourth quarter were 15 percent compared to 19 percent in the same period last year. For the twelve months ending February 28, 2011, revenues decreased 20 percent to $162.6 million and operating income decreased 34 percent to $27.1 million compared to $203.5 million and $40.8 million, respectively, in the prior year period.

Revenues for the Companys Galvanizing Service Segment for the fourth quarter were $57.1 million, compared to the $36.0 million in the same period last year, an increase of 59 percent.  The acquisition of North American Galvanizing accounted for $16.4 million of the increase in revenues.  Operating income was $14.8 million as compared to $9.2 million in the prior year period, an increase of 61 percent. The acquisition of North American Galvanizing contributed $4.2 million of the operating income. Tonnage shipped increased 52 percent for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 when compared to the prior year period. Operating margins for the fourth quarter were 26 percent, compared to 26 percent in the same period last year. For the twelve months of Fiscal 2011, revenues increased 42 percent to $218 million and operating income increased 27 percent to $57 million compared to $153.6 million and $44.8 million, respectively, for the twelve months of the prior year.  Operating margins were 26 percent compared to 29 percent in the prior year period.  The contribution to the twelve months from the acquisition of North American Galvanizing was $49.7 million in revenues and $12.2 million in operating income.
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of AZZ incorporated, commented, The fourth quarter incoming order rate again reflects what we believe to be the leveling off of our business cycle, and we are beginning to see modest increases in our inquiry and quotation levels for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment and growth in our Galvanizing Services Segment.  The book to ship of the quarter of 107 percent is encouraging considering the fact that our fourth quarter is traditionally our weakest quarter for incoming orders.  While the opportunities are increasing, pricing remains a challenge due to competitive forces and increased cost of commodities.  We believe this will continue through most of our new fiscal year. We continue to be very pleased with the positive impact and the successful assimilation of North American Galvanizing.  Organic growth in galvanizing combined with acquisition growth is most encouraging to us. The markets for our galvanizing services continue to show improvement.  Our efforts to identify additional product and market opportunities that will add growth and enhance our strategic position continue.
Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, the Companys issued projections for Fiscal 2012, that revenues would be in the range of $425 to $450 million and that fully diluted earnings per share would be in the range of $2.70 to $3.05, remains unchanged. Our guidance does include the increased interest expense of $0.34 per diluted share associated with the $125 million of Senior Private Placement Notes issued on January 20, 2011.
AZZ incorporated will conduct a conference call to discuss financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2011 at 4:30 P.M. ET on Thursday, April 7, 2011.  Interested parties can access the conference call by dialing (877) 317-6789 or (412) 317-6789 (international). The call will be web cast via the Internet at .   A replay of the call will be available for three days at (877) 344-7529 or (412) 317-0088 (international), confirmation #449698, or for 30 days at .

SECTION 7-REGULATION FD
 
 
ITEM 7.01 REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.
 
Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 are materials to be used by representatives of AZZ incorporated, a Texas corporation (the Company), in future presentations to the financial community.
Pursuant to General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K, shall not be deemed to be filed for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.
The information contained herein is summary information that is intended to be considered in the context of our SEC filings and other public announcements that we may make, by press release or otherwise, from time to time.
The Company undertakes no duty or obligation to publicly update or revise the information contained in this report, although the Company may do so from time to time as management of the Company believes is warranted. Any such updating may be made through the filing of other reports or documents with the SEC, through press releases or through other public disclosure.
In connection with such future presentations to the financial community, reconciliations between EBITDA (as defined below) and net income and between Free Cash Flow (as define below) to cash provided by operating activities are provided as follows. As used by the Company, these terms may differ from similarly captioned measures used by other companies.
EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  The Company presents EBITDA because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization, many of which present EBITDA when reporting their results.  The Company also uses EBITDA for the following purposes: (1) the Companys credit agreement uses EBITDA to measure compliance with covenants, such as fixed charge coverage and debt incurrence; (2) EBITDA is also used by potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions with the Company; and (3) EBITDA is also used by the Company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  Some of these limitations are: (a) EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Companys working capital needs, (b) EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Companys debts; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures.  Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Companys performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using EBITDA only on a supplemental basis.
Free Cash Flow (FCF), also a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash disbursed for capital expenditures excluding acquisitions.  The Company presents FCF because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization to the Company, many of which present FCF when reporting their results.
FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  These limitations include that FCF excludes significant cash flows, such as principal payments on debt.  Because of these limitations, FCF should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Companys performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using FCF only on a supplemental basis.

David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of AZZ incorporated, commented, As we reported last quarter, opportunities are increasing, but pricing remains a challenge due to competitive forces. This has and will continue to impact our backlog growth as we continue to adhere to our margin targets for new business. We are pleased that our book to ship ratio was strong despite these competitive conditions as we strive to improve the margins in our backlog.  Quarterly revenues reflected improvement in both segments and is encouraging. Operating margins, while below our prior year, were in line with our internal expectations.  Galvanizing had another quarter of solid organic and acquisition growth.  Our customers remain concerned as to what the domestic and international market growth will be.  Effective execution on all our opportunities, expansion of served domestic and international markets, and seeking out additional product and market opportunities to further enhance our strategic position will continue to be the focus and emphasis of our activities.
Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are revising our fiscal year 2012 guidance for revenues to be in the range of $450 to $475 million. Our earnings guidance is revised and anticipated to be within the range of $2.90 to $3.10 per diluted share.  The previously issued guidance was for revenues to be in the range of $425 to $450 million and that fully diluted earnings per share would be in the range of $2.70 to $3.05.  Our guidance does include the increased interest expense in fiscal 2012 of $0.34 per diluted share associated with the $125 million of Senior Private Placement Notes issued on January 20, 2011.

see
 
 
 
 
SECTION 7-REGULATION FD
 
 
ITEM 7.01 REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.
 
Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 are materials to be used by representatives of AZZ incorporated, a Texas corporation (the Company), in future presentations to the financial community.
Pursuant to General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K, shall not be deemed to be filed for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.
The information contained herein is summary information that is intended to be considered in the context of our SEC filings and other public announcements that we may make, by press release or otherwise, from time to time.
The Company undertakes no duty or obligation to publicly update or revise the information contained in this report, although the Company may do so from time to time as management of the Company believes is warranted. Any such updating may be made through the filing of other reports or documents with the SEC, through press releases or through other public disclosure.
In connection with such future presentations to the financial community, reconciliations between EBITDA (as defined below) and net income and between Free Cash Flow (as define below) to cash provided by operating activities are provided as follows. As used by the Company, these terms may differ from similarly captioned measures used by other companies.
EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  The Company presents EBITDA because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization, many of which present EBITDA when reporting their results.  The Company also uses EBITDA for the following purposes: (1) the Companys credit agreement uses EBITDA to measure compliance with covenants, such as fixed charge coverage and debt incurrence; (2) EBITDA is also used by potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions with the Company; and (3) EBITDA is also used by the Company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  Some of these limitations are: (a) EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Companys working capital needs, (b) EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Companys debts; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures.  Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Companys performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using EBITDA only on a supplemental basis.
Free Cash Flow (FCF), also a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash disbursed for capital expenditures excluding acquisitions.  The Company presents FCF because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization to the Company, many of which present FCF when reporting their results.
FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  These limitations include that FCF excludes significant cash flows, such as principal payments on debt.  Because of these limitations, FCF should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Companys performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using FCF only on a supplemental basis.

SECTION 7-REGULATION FD
 
 
ITEM 7.01 REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.
 
Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 are materials to be used by representatives of AZZ incorporated, a Texas corporation (the Company), in future presentations to the financial community.
Pursuant to General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K, shall not be deemed to be filed for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.
The information contained herein is summary information that is intended to be considered in the context of our SEC filings and other public announcements that we may make, by press release or otherwise, from time to time.
The Company undertakes no duty or obligation to publicly update or revise the information contained in this report, although the Company may do so from time to time as management of the Company believes is warranted. Any such updating may be made through the filing of other reports or documents with the SEC, through press releases or through other public disclosure.
In connection with such future presentations to the financial community, reconciliations between EBITDA (as defined below) and net income and between Free Cash Flow (as define below) to cash provided by operating activities are provided as follows. As used by the Company, these terms may differ from similarly captioned measures used by other companies.
EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  The Company presents EBITDA because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization, many of which present EBITDA when reporting their results.  The Company also uses EBITDA for the following purposes: (1) the Companys credit agreement uses EBITDA to measure compliance with covenants, such as fixed charge coverage and debt incurrence; (2) EBITDA is also used by potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions with the Company; and (3) EBITDA is also used by the Company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  Some of these limitations are: (a) EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Companys working capital needs, (b) EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Companys debts; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures.  Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Companys performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using EBITDA only on a supplemental basis.
Free Cash Flow (FCF), also a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash disbursed for capital expenditures excluding acquisitions.  The Company presents FCF because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization to the Company, many of which present FCF when reporting their results.
FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  These limitations include that FCF excludes significant cash flows, such as principal payments on debt.  Because of these limitations, FCF should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Companys performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using FCF only on a supplemental basis.

Notwithstanding any payment or payments made by any Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder, or any application by any Holder of any security or of any credits or claims, no Subsidiary Guarantor will assert or exercise any rights of any Holder or of such Subsidiary Guarantor against the Company to recover the amount of any payment made by such Subsidiary Guarantor to any Holder hereunder by way of any claim, remedy or subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnity, participation or otherwise arising by contract, by statute, under common law or otherwise, and such Subsidiary Guarantor shall not have any right of recourse to or any claim against assets or property of the Company, in each case unless and until the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full.  Until such time (but not thereafter), each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby expressly waives any right to exercise any claim, right or remedy which such Subsidiary Guarantor may now have or hereafter acquire against the Company or any other Subsidiary Guarantor that arises under the Notes, the Private Shelf Agreement or from the performance by any Subsidiary Guarantor of the guaranty hereunder including any claim, remedy or right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification or participation in any claim, right or remedy of any Holder against the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, or any security that any Holder now has or hereafter acquires, whether or not such claim, right or remedy arises in equity, under contract, by statute, under common law or otherwise.  If any amount shall be paid to a Subsidiary Guarantor by the Company or another Subsidiary Guarantor after payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, and all or any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations shall thereafter be reinstated in whole or in part and any Holder is required to repay any sums received by any of them in payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, this Guaranty shall be automatically reinstated and such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Holders and shall forthwith be paid to the Holders to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.  The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Guaranty, and any satisfaction and discharge of the Company by virtue of any payment, court order or any Federal or state law.
 
E-2.2-12
 
 
 
If any Subsidiary Guarantor is or becomes the holder of any indebtedness payable by the Company or another Subsidiary Guarantor, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby subordinates all such indebtedness owing to it from the Company or such other Subsidiary Guarantor to all indebtedness of the Company to the Holders, and agrees that, during the continuance of any Event of Default, it shall not accept any payment on the same until payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations and shall in no circumstance whatsoever attempt to set-off or reduce any obligations hereunder because of such indebtedness.  If any amount shall nevertheless be paid in violation of the foregoing to a Subsidiary Guarantor by the Company or another Subsidiary Guarantor prior to payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Holders and shall forthwith be paid to the Holders to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.
 
 
(a)If after receipt of any payment of, or proceeds of any security applied (or intended to be applied) to the payment of all or any part of, the Guaranteed Obligations, any Holder is for any reason compelled to surrender or voluntarily surrenders (under circumstances in which it believes it could reasonably be expected to be so compelled if it did not voluntarily surrender), such payment or proceeds to any Person (i) because such payment or application of proceeds is or may be avoided, invalidated, declared fraudulent, set aside, determined to be void or voidable as a preference, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, impermissible set-off or a diversion of trust funds or (ii) for any other similar reason, including, without limitation, (x) any judgment, decree or order of any court or administrative body having jurisdiction over any Holder or any of their respective properties or (y) any settlement or compromise of any such claim effected by any Holder with any such claimant (including the Company), then the Guaranteed Obligations or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be reinstated and continue, and this Guaranty shall continue in full force as if such payment or proceeds had not been received, notwithstanding any revocation thereof or the cancellation of any Note or any other instrument evidencing any Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise, and the Subsidiary Guarantors, jointly and severally, shall be liable to pay the Holders, and hereby do indemnify the Holders and hold them harmless for, the amount of such payment or proceeds so surrendered and all expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees, court costs and expenses attributable thereto) incurred by any Holder in defense of any claim made against any of them that any payment or proceeds received by any Holder in respect of all or part of the Guaranteed Obligations must be surrendered.  The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Guaranty, and any satisfaction and discharge of the Company by virtue of any payment, court order or any Federal or state law.
 
(b)If an event permitting the acceleration of the maturity of any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall at any time have occurred and be continuing, and such acceleration shall at such time be prevented by reason of the pendency against the Company or any other Person of any case or proceeding contemplated by Section 8(a) hereof, then, for the purpose of defining the obligation of any Subsidiary Guarantor under this Guaranty, the maturity of the principal amount of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be deemed to have been accelerated with the same effect as if
 
E-2.2-13
 
 
an acceleration had occurred in accordance with the terms of such Guaranteed Obligations, and such Subsidiary Guarantor shall forthwith pay such principal amount, all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and all other Guaranteed Obligations, due or that would have become due but for such case or proceeding, without further notice or demand.
 
 
This Guaranty and all guarantees, covenants and agreements of each Subsidiary Guarantor contained herein shall continue in full force and effect and shall not be discharged until such time as all of the principal of and interest on the Notes, the other Guaranteed Obligations and other independent payment obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be paid in cash and performed in full, and all of the agreements of each of the other Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder shall be duly paid in cash and performed in full.
 
 
In order to provide for just and equitable contribution among the Subsidiary Guarantors, each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that, to the extent any Subsidiary Guarantor makes any payment hereunder on any date which, when added to all preceding payments made by such Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder, would result in the aggregate payments by such Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder exceeding its Percentage (as defined below) of all payments then or theretofore made by all Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall have a right of contribution against each other Subsidiary Guarantor whose aggregate payments then or theretofore made hereunder are less than its Percentage of all payments by all Subsidiary Guarantors then or theretofore made hereunder, in an amount such that, after giving effect to any such contribution rights, each Subsidiary Guarantor will have paid only its Percentage of all payments by all Subsidiary Guarantors then or theretofore made hereunder.  A Subsidiary Guarantors Percentage on any date shall mean the percentage obtained by dividing (a) the Adjusted Net Assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor on such date by (b) the sum of the Adjusted Net Assets of all Subsidiary Guarantors on such date.   means, for each Subsidiary Guarantor on any date, the lesser of (i) the amount by which the fair value of the property of such Subsidiary Guarantor exceeds the total amount of liabilities, including contingent liabilities, but excluding liabilities under this Guaranty, of such Subsidiary Guarantor on such date and (ii) the amount by which the present fair salable value of the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor on such date exceeds the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability of such Subsidiary Guarantor on its debts, excluding debt in respect of this Guaranty, as they become absolute and matured.
Adjusted Net Assets
 
 
Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby confirms that it is the intention of such Subsidiary Guarantor that the guarantee by such Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Title 11 of the United States Code, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar
 
E-2.2-14
 
 
applicable Federal or state law (all such statutes and laws are collectively referred to as ).  To effectuate the foregoing intention, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby irrevocably agrees that the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be limited to the amount as will, after giving effect to all rights to receive any collections from or payments by or on behalf of any other Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to Section 10 hereof, result in the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under this Guaranty not constituting such a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.  In the event that the liability of any Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder is limited pursuant to this Section 11 to an amount that is less than the total amount of the Guaranteed Obligations, then it is understood and agreed that the portion of the Guaranteed Obligations for which such Subsidiary Guarantor is liable hereunder shall be the last portion of the Guaranteed Obligations to be repaid.
Fraudulent Conveyance Laws

David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of AZZ incorporated, commented, We are pleased with the results of the third quarter of fiscal 2012 for both segments of the Company.  The quarter and first nine months positively reflect effective identification and execution of our opportunities in a market environment of continued economic and regulatory uncertainty, combined with lingering pricing pressures.  We achieved another quarter of backlog growth and are extremely pleased with both the volume and operating margins of the Galvanizing Services Segment.  We continue our efforts to identity product and market expansion opportunities to further enhance our strategic position that will supplement our organic growth.
Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are revising our Fiscal Year 2012 guidance for revenues to be in the range of $465 million to $475 million and for earnings to be within the range of $3.00 to $3.15 per diluted share.  Previously our guidance was for revenues to be in the range of $450 to $475 million and for earnings to be within the range of $2.90 to $3.10.  Our guidance does include the increased interest expense in Fiscal 2012 of $0.34 per diluted share associated with the $125 million of Senior Private Placement Notes issued on January 20, 2011.

SECTION 7 - REGULATION FD
ITEM 7.01 REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.
On January 20, 2011, AZZ incorporated (AZZ) issued a press release containing financial projections and guidance for the fiscal year beginning March 1, 2012 and ending February 28, 2013.  The press release is furnished with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.  Also furnished with and incorporated into this Current Report on Form 8-K is Exhibit 99.2, Financial and Other Statistical Information, which contains guidance and selected financial projections for the fiscal years ending February 29, 2012 and February 28, 2013.  The guidance contained in the attached exhibits consists of either a projected range or managements estimate of most likely results.  These projections involve risk and uncertainties, the outcome of which cannot be foreseen at this time and, therefore, actual results will vary from these forecasts.  AZZ undertakes no obligation to affirm publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of information, future events or otherwise.
Also furnished and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.3 are materials to be used by representatives of AZZ incorporated, a Texas corporation (the Company), in future presentations to the financial community.
Pursuant to General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K, shall not be deemed to be filed for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.
The information contained herein is summary information that is intended to be considered in the context of our SEC filings and other public announcements that we may make, by press release or otherwise, from time to time.
The Company undertakes no duty or obligation to publicly update or revise the information contained in this report, although the Company may do so from time to time as management of the Company believes is warranted. Any such updating may be made through the filing of other reports or documents with the SEC, through press releases or through other public disclosure.
In connection with such future presentations to the financial community, reconciliations between EBITDA (as defined below) and net income and between Free Cash Flow (as define below) to cash provided by operating activities are provided as follows. As used by the Company, these terms may differ from similarly captioned measures used by other companies.
EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  The Company presents EBITDA because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization, many of which present EBITDA when reporting their results.  The Company also uses EBITDA for the following purposes: (1) the Companys credit agreement uses EBITDA to measure compliance with covenants, such as fixed charge coverage and debt incurrence; (2) EBITDA is also used by potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions with the Company; and (3) EBITDA is also used by the Company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  Some of these limitations are: (a) EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Companys working capital needs, (b) EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Companys debts; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures.  Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Companys performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using EBITDA only on a supplemental basis.
Free Cash Flow (FCF), also a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash disbursed for capital expenditures excluding acquisitions.  The Company presents FCF because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization to the Company, many of which present FCF when reporting their results.
FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  These limitations include that FCF excludes significant cash flows, such as principal payments on debt.  Because of these limitations, FCF should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Companys performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using FCF only on a supplemental basis.

January 20, 2012  - AZZ incorporated (NYSE: AZZ), a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services, today announced the Board of Directors, at its regularly scheduled meeting, has declared a quarterly cash dividend of 25 cents per share payable on February 17, 2012 to shareholders of record on February 3, 2012.
FORT WORTH, TX
Also at the regularly scheduled meeting, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to 10 percent of the shares of the Companys outstanding shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share.  The share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date, and the amount and prices paid for any future share purchases under the new authorization will be based on market conditions and other factors at the time of the purchase.  Repurchases under the share repurchase authorization will be made through open market purchases or private transactions, in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As of January 20, 2012, there were approximately 13 million shares of AZZ incorporated common stock issued and outstanding.
The company is issuing revenue and earnings guidance for Fiscal Year 2013.  Fiscal Year 2013 refers to the 12 month period beginning March 1, 2012 and ending on February 28, 2013.
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of the company, stated, Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are projecting our 26th consecutive year of profitability. Our earnings are estimated to be within the range of $3.25 and $3.55 per diluted share, and revenues are estimated to be within the range of $475 to $510 million. We continue to build upon the success we have been able to achieve over the past decade, and continually strive to further enhance the performance of the Company. Electrical revenues are projected to be up slightly.  Due to pricing pressures that began in the current fiscal year and which are expected to continue into the new fiscal year, margins in the Electrical Segment will only see modest improvement and should be in the range of 14 to 16 percent. The Galvanizing Services Segment revenues are projected to be up due primarily to the full year impact of the Galvan Metals acquisition, our first Canadian galvanizing facility, which is anticipated to close on January 31, 2012.  Margins for this Segment should remain strong, and
 
 
 
should be in the range of 24 to 26 percent.  It is anticipated that 60 percent of our revenues will be derived from the Galvanizing Services Segment and 40 percent from the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment.  Further information is provided in our Form 8-K filed on January 20, 2012.
Mr. Dingus continued, Our next, regularly scheduled quarterly conference call is in April 2012, where we will be reporting the operating results for our fourth quarter and 2012 fiscal year and a discussion of our Fiscal Year 2013 guidance.  We are continuing our efforts to seek out growth and expansion opportunities for both Segments.  The strength of our balance sheet and cash position fully supports this strategy.  The company is well positioned to capitalize on improving market conditions, in both segments.

SECTION 7-REGULATION FD
 
 
ITEM 7.01 REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.
 
Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 are materials to be used by representatives of AZZ incorporated, a Texas corporation (the Company), in future presentations to the financial community.
Pursuant to General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K, shall not be deemed to be filed for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.
The information contained herein is summary information that is intended to be considered in the context of our SEC filings and other public announcements that we may make, by press release or otherwise, from time to time.
The Company undertakes no duty or obligation to publicly update or revise the information contained in this report, although the Company may do so from time to time as management of the Company believes is warranted. Any such updating may be made through the filing of other reports or documents with the SEC, through press releases or through other public disclosure.
In connection with such future presentations to the financial community, reconciliations between EBITDA (as defined below) and net income and between Free Cash Flow (as define below) to cash provided by operating activities are provided as follows. As used by the Company, these terms may differ from similarly captioned measures used by other companies.
EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  The Company presents EBITDA because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization, many of which present EBITDA when reporting their results.  The Company also uses EBITDA for the following purposes: (1) the Companys credit agreement uses EBITDA to measure compliance with covenants, such as fixed charge coverage and debt incurrence; (2) EBITDA is also used by potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions with the Company; and (3) EBITDA is also used by the Company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  Some of these limitations are: (a) EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Companys working capital needs, (b) EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Companys debts; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures.  Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Companys performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using EBITDA only on a supplemental basis.
Free Cash Flow (FCF), also a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash disbursed for capital expenditures excluding acquisitions.  The Company presents FCF because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization to the Company, many of which present FCF when reporting their results.
FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  These limitations include that FCF excludes significant cash flows, such as principal payments on debt.  Because of these limitations, FCF should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Companys performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using FCF only on a supplemental basis.

EX 99.1
 - AZZ incorporated , a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services, today announced unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended May 31, 2012. Revenues for the first quarter were $127.1 million compared to $114.3 million for the same quarter last year, an increase of 11 percent. Net income for the quarter was $16 million, or $1.26 per diluted share, compared to net income of $9.5 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, in last years first fiscal quarter.

FORT WORTH, TX
(NYSE:AZZ)
The net income and earnings per diluted share for the first quarter reflect a pre-tax gain related to a partial insurance settlement for assets destroyed in a recent fire at one of the Companys galvanizing facilities.  Based on preliminary estimate of the damage sustained at this facility, a pre-tax asset impairment charge of approximately $4 million was recorded during the first quarter of FY 2013, which was reduced by $10 million in insurance proceeds received under our property and casualty insurance policy, resulting in a $6 million gain. While we expect to receive substantial additional insurance proceeds under the policy in the future, the ultimate amount that we collect has not yet been determined. Any future recoveries under this policy will be recognized in the period in which proceeds are approved by our insurance carrier. In addition, the company booked $.6 million of expense associated with the acquisition of Nuclear Logistics, Incorporated (NLI) during the first quarter.   Pro forma earnings per diluted share exclusive of these non operational income and expense items were $1.02, a 36 percent gain over the same period last year.
Backlog at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 was $136.1 million. Backlog at the end of the first quarter of FY 2012 was $114.7 million and $138.6 million at February 29, 2012.  Incoming orders for the first quarter were $124.6 million while shipments for the quarter totaled $127.1 million, resulting in a book to ship ratio of 98 percent.

Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment for the first quarter of FY 2013 were $44.7 million as compared to $48.3 million for the same quarter last year, a decrease of 7 percent.  Operating income for the segment decreased 8 percent to $6.8 million compared to $7.4 million in the same period last year.  Operating margins were 15 percent for each of the three month periods ended May 31, 2012 and 2011.
Revenues for the Companys Galvanizing Service Segment for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 were $82.5 million, compared to the $66.1 million in the same period last year, an increase of 25 percent.  Operating income was $22.6 million as compared to $17.1 million in the prior period, an increase of 32 percent. Operating margins for the first quarter were 27 percent compared to 26 percent in the same quarter last year.
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of AZZ incorporated, commented, The operating results for the Electrical and Industrial Segment were as anticipated and internally forecasted.  We continue to face market conditions where customers are hesitant to proceed with many capital expenditure programs.  We are excited about the positive contribution that the NLI acquisition will make to the Company and the Electrical and Industrial Segment effective June 1, 2012.  The Galvanizing Segment had another outstanding quarter, exceeding our internal expectations.  Most served markets reflect robust demand.  We expect continued strong demand and operating performance in this segment for the balance of our fiscal year. For both segments, our customers remain concerned as to what the domestic and international market conditions will be.  Effective execution on all our opportunities, expansion of served domestic and international markets, and seeking out additional product and market opportunities to further enhance our strategic position will continue to be the focus and emphasis of our activities.
Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are revising our fiscal year 2013 guidance for revenues to be in the range of $550 to $575 million. Our earnings guidance, before the effect of the two-for-one stock split, is revised and anticipated to be within the range of $4.10 to $4.30 per diluted share.  The previously issued guidance was for revenues to be in the range of $475 to $510 million and that fully diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.55 per diluted share.  Our guidance does reflect the effect of the acquisition of NLI during the last nine months of fiscal 2013. Revenues from the acquisition are anticipated to range from $55 to $60 million and earning per share accretion to be $0.30 to $0.35 per diluted share. The NLI accretion has been adjusted by approximately $0.16 per diluted share to reflect the estimated amortization of their acquired backlog which will amortize over the next two years.  Any future insurance recoveries associated with our facility fire will be recognized in the period in which proceeds are approved by our insurance carrier and are not included in our earnings guidance.
The Company announced that the Board of Directors, at its regularly scheduled quarterly meeting, declared a 25 cent per share cash dividend on the Companys common stock outstanding.  The cash dividend of 25 cents a share is prior to the effective date of the two-for-one stock dividend.  The cash dividend will be paid at the close of business on July 26, 2012, to shareholders of record on July 12, 2012.
Additionally, the Company announced that the Board of Directors, at its regularly scheduled quarterly meeting, declared a 2 for 1 stock split of the Companys Common Stock in the form of a 100% stock dividend, payable on July 30, 2012 to shareholders of record as of July 16, 2012,

with a brokers cut-off date of July 23, 2012.  The stock dividend entitles each shareholder of record as of July 16, 2012 to receive one additional share of common stock for each share then owned. Prior to the most recent quarterly filing of May 31, 2012, the company had outstanding approximately 12.6 million shares.  Upon completion of the stock dividend, the outstanding shares will be approximately 25.3 million shares. The share and per share information in this release has not been adjusted to reflect the stock split.

SECTION 7-REGULATION FD
 
 
ITEM 7.01 REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.
 
Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 are materials to be used by representatives of AZZ incorporated, a Texas corporation (the Company), in future presentations to the financial community.
Pursuant to General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K, shall not be deemed to be filed for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.
The information contained herein is summary information that is intended to be considered in the context of our SEC filings and other public announcements that we may make, by press release or otherwise, from time to time.
The Company undertakes no duty or obligation to publicly update or revise the information contained in this report, although the Company may do so from time to time as management of the Company believes is warranted. Any such updating may be made through the filing of other reports or documents with the SEC, through press releases or through other public disclosure.
In connection with such future presentations to the financial community, reconciliations between EBITDA (as defined below) and net income and between Free Cash Flow (as define below) to cash provided by operating activities are provided as follows. As used by the Company, these terms may differ from similarly captioned measures used by other companies.
EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  The Company presents EBITDA because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization, many of which present EBITDA when reporting their results.  The Company also uses EBITDA for the following purposes: (1) the Companys credit agreement uses EBITDA to measure compliance with covenants, such as fixed charge coverage and debt incurrence; (2) EBITDA is also used by potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions with the Company; and (3) EBITDA is also used by the Company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  Some of these limitations are: (a) EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Companys working capital needs, (b) EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Companys debts; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures.  Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Companys performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using EBITDA only on a supplemental basis.
Free Cash Flow (FCF), also a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash disbursed for capital expenditures excluding acquisitions.  The Company presents FCF because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization to the Company, many of which present FCF when reporting their results.
FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP.  These limitations include that FCF excludes significant cash flows, such as principal payments on debt.  Because of these limitations, FCF should not be considered as a principal indicator of the Companys performance.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companys GAAP results and using FCF only on a supplemental basis.

Any future recoveries under this policy will be recognized in the period in which proceeds are approved by

Of the backlog of $215.8 million, 29 percent is to be delivered outside of the U.S.
Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 were $60.4 million as compared to $43.9 million for the same quarter last year, an increase of 38 percent. NLI, acquired June 1, 2012, contributed $16.4 million of this increase. Operating income for the segment increased 57 percent to $9 million compared to $5.7 million in the same period last year. Operating margins for the third quarter were 15 percent for the quarter as compared to 13 percent in the prior year period.

David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of AZZ incorporated, commented, The third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2013 reflects favorable year over year growth in both segments and effective identification and execution of our opportunities in a market environment of continued economic and regulatory uncertainty. We are extremely pleased with the reported results. We continue our effort to identify product and market expansion opportunities to further enhance our strategic position.
The company today announced that it has acquired G3 Galvanizing, a galvanizing operation in Halifax, Nova Scotia on January 2, 2013. This acquisition is part of the stated AZZ strategy to continue the geographic expansion of its served markets that should provide a basis for continued growth of the Galvanizing Services Segment of AZZ. G3, while relatively small in terms of production and revenue, has a rich heritage of providing superior level of service and support to the customers in Canadian Maritimes. Operated with pride and integrity since its founding, this very successful operation will complement our existing network of North American plants. Existing operating management has agreed to remain with the company and the acquisition is anticipated to be accretive in the first year of operation.

Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are revising our fiscal year 2013 guidance for revenues to be in the range of $575 to $585 million. Our earnings are anticipated to be in the range of $2.35 and $2.45 per diluted share. This guidance reflects the two-for-one-stock split effective July 30, 2012. The previously issued guidance was for revenues to be in the range of $575 to $600 million and that fully diluted earnings per share to be in the rage of $2.25 to $2.40 after the effect of the two-for-one stock split. Our guidance does reflect the acquisition of NLI during the last nine months of fiscal 2013 and the acquisition of Galvcast for the last five months of fiscal 2013, and G3 Galvanizing for the last two months of the fiscal 2013.
AZZ incorporated will conduct a conference call to discuss financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2013 at 11:00 A.M. ET on Wednesday, January 9, 2013.

ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS
On January 18, 2013, AZZ incorporated (the Company) issued a press release titled AZZ incorporated Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend and Issues Revenue and Earnings Guidance for Fiscal Year 2014.  This press release contained a typographical error relating to the percentage of revenue anticipated to be derived from each of the Company's operating segments. On January 18, 2013, the Company issued a corrected press release, in which the seventh sentence of the third paragraph of the original press release is corrected to state that It is anticipated that 57 percent of our revenues will be derived from the Galvanizing Services Segment and 43 percent from the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment. Other than correcting this typographical error, all other information included in the corrected press release filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K is unchanged from the information included in the original press release.
Attached is Exhibit 99.2, Unaudited Financial and Other Statistical Information, and Guidance for Fiscal Year 2013 and Fiscal Year 2014.

These projections involve risk and uncertainties, the outcome of which cannot be foreseen at this time and, therefore, actual results will vary from these forecasts.

FORT WORTH, TX
- AZZ incorporated (NYSE: AZZ), a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services, today announced the Board of Directors, at its regularly scheduled meeting, has declared a quarterly cash dividend of 14 cents per share payable on February 15, 2013 to shareholders of record on February 1, 2013.
The company is issuing revenue and earnings guidance for Fiscal Year 2014. Fiscal Year 2014 refers to the 12 month period beginning March 1, 2013 and ending on February 28, 2014.
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of the company, stated, Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are projecting our 27th consecutive year of profitability. Our earnings are estimated to be within the range of $2.50 and $2.75 per diluted share, and revenues are estimated to be within the range of $625 to $660 million. We continue to build upon the success we have been able to achieve over the past decade, and continually strive to further enhance the performance of the Company. Electrical revenues are projected to be up due to the full year impact of NLI as well as organic growth. Margins in the Electrical Segment should be in the range of 14 to 16 percent. The Galvanizing Services Segment revenues are projected to be up due primarily to the full year impact of our acquisitions
and market share improvement. Margins for this Segment should remain strong, and should be in the range of 26 to 28 percent. It is anticipated that 57 percent of our revenues will be derived from the Galvanizing Services Segment and 43 percent from the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment. Further information is provided in our Form 8-K to be filed on January 18, 2013.
Mr. Dingus continued, Our next, regularly scheduled quarterly conference call is in April 2013, where we will be reporting the operating results for our fourth quarter and 2013 fiscal year and a discussion of our Fiscal Year 2014 guidance. We are continuing our efforts to seek out growth and expansion opportunities for both Segments. The strength of our balance sheet and cash position fully supports this strategy. The company is well positioned to capitalize on improving market conditions, in both segments.

On February 22, 2013, AZZ incorporated, a Texas corporation (AZZ), agreed to acquire Aquilex Specialty Repair and Overhaul LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a global leader in maintenance, repair and revitalization services to the power generation, refining and industrial markets (Aquilex), pursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Agreement) by and among AZZ, Arbor-Crowley, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of AZZ (Purchaser), Aquilex, the direct holders of all of the outstanding equity securities of Aquilex identified therein and certain indirect holders of equity securities of Aquilex identified therein (collectively, the Sellers). The purchase price for this acquisition is $250 million, subject to adjustment based on closing working capital as more fully described in the Agreement. The acquisition and other transactions contemplated in the Agreement are expected to close in March of 2013, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions as set forth in the Agreement.
The Purchaser, Aquilex and the Sellers have made customary representations and warranties in the Agreement and agreed to certain customary covenants, including covenants regarding operation of the business of Aquilex and its subsidiaries prior to closing of the acquisition.
The foregoing description of the Agreement is only a summary, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
Cautionary Note Regarding the Agreement
The Agreement has been included to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Aquilex, the Sellers, AZZ or the Purchaser. In particular, the representations and warranties contained in the Agreement were made only for the purposes of the Agreement as of the specific dates therein and were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Agreement.
The representations and warranties contained in the Agreement may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the parties to the Agreement and are qualified by information in confidential disclosure schedules provided by Aquilex and the Sellers in connection with the signing of the Agreement. These confidential disclosure schedules contain information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in the Agreement. Moreover, certain representations and warranties in the Agreement may be subject to a standard of materiality provided for in the Agreement and have been used for the purpose of allocating risk among Aquilex, the Sellers, AZZ and the Purchaser, rather than establishing matters of fact. Information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may also change after the date of the Agreement, which subsequent information may not be fully disclosed in the parties' public disclosures. Accordingly, the representations and warranties in the Agreement may not constitute the actual state of facts about Aquilex, the Sellers, AZZ or the Purchaser.

Transaction Price Adjustments.
(a)
    
As promptly as practicable after the Closing, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Representative (i) a balance sheet of the Company as of the time of the Closing on the Closing Date (the 
Closing Balance Sheet
), which shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied (
provided
that the Closing Balance Sheet need not contain footnote disclosures), and (ii) a statement (the

Exhibit 1.02(a)
), Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses and in accordance with GAAP consistently applied. The parties agree that the purpose of preparing the Closing Balance Sheet and determining Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses pursuant to this
Section 1.05
is to measure changes (if any) in the amounts of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses from the respective amounts estimated pursuant to
Section 1.02(a)
in order to determine the Purchaser Adjustment Amount or Seller Adjustment Amount, as the case may be, and that such processes are not intended to permit the introduction of principles, policies, practices, procedures, methodologies, classifications, methods, conventions, assumptions, judgments or estimation techniques in preparing the Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing Statement (or the amounts set forth therein), as the case may be, that are different from those used in the determination of the respective amounts estimated pursuant to
Section 1.02(a)
or that are not in accordance with GAAP consistently applied or as set forth on
Exhibit 1.02(a)
. If the Closing Statement is not delivered to the Representative within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, then the Companys estimates delivered pursuant to
Section 1.02(a)
shall constitute the amounts for Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses and shall be final and binding upon, and nonappealable, by the parties hereto.
(b)
    
During the sixty (60) days immediately following the Representatives receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement and any period of dispute thereafter (as described in
Section 1.05(c)
) with respect to such Closing Balance Sheet or Closing Statement, the Company and the Purchaser shall reasonably assist the Representative and its representatives in the review of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (including by furnishing on a timely basis all information requested in writing by the Representative or its representatives necessary or useful in connection with such review and provide the Representative and its representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the books, records (including work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents), supporting data, facilities and relevant personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including Company personnel responsible for
4
accounting and finance, senior management and the Companys accountants and advisors) for purposes of their review of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement. The Purchaser agrees that following the Closing it will not, and it will cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to, take any actions with respect to the books, records, policies and procedures of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would obstruct or prevent the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing Statement, or the Representatives review of the foregoing, in each case, as provided in this
Section 1.05
.
(c)
    
If the Representative disagrees with any part of the Purchasers calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses as set forth in the Closing Statement, the Representative shall, within sixty (60) days after the Representatives receipt of the Closing Statement, notify the Purchaser in writing of such disagreement by setting forth the Representatives calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash or Transaction Expenses (an 
Objection Notice
). If an Objection Notice is not delivered to the Purchaser within sixty (60) days after the Representatives receipt of the Closing Statement, the Closing Statement shall be final and binding upon, and non-appealable by, the parties hereto. During the fifteen (15) days immediately following the delivery of an Objection Notice, or such longer period as the Representative and the Purchaser may agree in writing, the Representative and the Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to any matter specified in the Objection Notice, and all such discussions related thereto shall be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and any applicable similar state rule, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Representative and the Purchaser. In the event that the Purchaser and the Representative resolve in writing all such disagreements, the amounts of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses so agreed in writing by the Purchaser and the Representative shall be final and binding upon, and non-appealable by, the parties hereto. In the event that the Purchaser and the Representative are unable to resolve all such disagreements within such fifteen (15) day period after the Purchasers receipt of such Objection Notice, the Purchaser and the Representative shall submit such remaining disagreements to Ernst & Young LLP, or, in the event Ernst & Young LLP declines to accept engagement in connection herewith, such other nationally recognized certified public accounting firm as is acceptable to the Purchaser and the Representative (the 
Accounting Firm
).
(d)
    
The Purchaser and the Representative shall cause the Accounting Firm to make a determination with respect to all remaining disagreements regarding the computation of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses identified in the Objection Notice as soon as practicable and in any event within thirty (30) days after its retention. The Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and amounts in the Purchaser and the Representatives respective calculations of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses (as set forth on the Closing Statement or Objection Notice, as applicable) that are identified as being items and amounts to which the Purchasers and the Representative have been unable to agree. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party (as set forth on the Closing Statement or Objection Notice, as applicable). The Accounting Firms
5
determination of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses shall be based solely on written materials submitted by the Purchaser and the Representative (
i.e.
, not on the basis of an independent review) and in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement, including the definitions of Net Working Capital (including
Exhibit 1.02(a)
), Indebtedness, Cash and Transaction Expenses. The determination of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses by the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto and shall not be subject to appeal or further review.
(e)
    
The costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm in determining Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses shall be borne by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Representative (from the Representative Expense Holdback Amount), on the other hand, based upon the percentage that the portion of the aggregate contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the aggregate amount actually contested by such party. For example, if the Purchaser claims Closing Net Working Capital is $1,000 less than the amount determined by the Representative, and the Representative contests only $500 of the amount claimed by the Purchaser, and if the Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the Purchaser $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be allocated 60% (
i.e.
, 300  500) to the Representative and 40% (
i.e.
, 200  500) to the Purchaser. In connection with its determination of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses, the Accounting Firm shall, pursuant to the terms of this
Section 1.05(e)
, also determine the allocation of its fees and expenses between the Purchaser and the Representative, which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto.
(f)
    
Within five (5) Business Days after Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses are finally determined pursuant to this
Section 1.05
:
(i)
    
if the result of Closing Net Working Capital,
plus
Closing Cash,
minus
Closing Indebtedness,
minus
Transaction Expenses, in each case as finally determined pursuant to
Section 1.05(c)
or
Section 1.05(d)
, is less than the result of Estimated Closing Net Working Capital,
plus
Estimated Cash,
minus
Estimated Indebtedness,
minus
Estimated Transaction Expenses, then the Sellers, jointly and severally, shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to such deficit (the 
Purchaser Adjustment Amount
) (and for the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser Adjustment Amount will not be paid out of or reduce the Escrow Account);
(ii)
    
if the result of Closing Net Working Capital,
plus
Closing Cash,
minus
Closing Indebtedness,
minus
Transaction Expenses, in each case as finally determined pursuant to
Section 1.05(c)
or
Section 1.05(d)
, is greater than the result of Estimated Closing Net Working Capital,
plus
Estimated Cash,
minus
Estimated Indebtedness,
minus
Estimated Transaction Expenses, then the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company to, pay to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the Sellers, an amount equal to such excess (the 
Seller Adjustment Amount
), to be further delivered by the Paying Agent to each Seller in accordance with its respective Allocation Percentage; and
6
(iii)
    
any payment to be made pursuant to this
Section 1.05(f)
(the 
Purchase Price Adjustments
) shall (y) be treated by all parties for tax purposes as adjustments to the Transaction Price and (z) be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to, as applicable, the account(s) designated in writing by the Purchaser prior to such payment or the account(s) designated in writing by the Paying Agent prior to such payment for the benefit of the Sellers, as applicable.
(g)
    
The parties agree that the adjustments to Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, Estimated Indebtedness, Estimated Cash and Estimated Transaction Expenses provided for in this
Section 1.05
, and the dispute resolution provisions provided for in this
Section 1.05
, shall be the exclusive remedies for the matters addressed by this
Section 1.05
. The payment of any adjustment to the Transaction Price pursuant to this
Section 1.05
shall not be considered a breach of any representation, warranty or other provision of this Agreement or any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement. None of the parties hereto nor any of their respective Affiliates or representatives shall make any claim in respect of the determination of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash or Transaction Expenses other than in accordance with and as set forth in this
Section 1.05
.
(h)
    
The parties agree that (i) the Representative and any of the Sellers and their Affiliates may engage PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and its Affiliates to advise or represent them in connection with the determination of any Purchase Price Adjustment and the matters addressed by this
Section 1.05
and (ii) the Purchaser and its Affiliates may engage BDO USA, LLP and its Affiliates to advise or represent it in connection with the determination of any Purchase Price Adjustment and the matters addressed by this
Section 1.05
. Each party will enter into such waivers, indemnities and other agreements as PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or BDO USA, LLP or each of their respective Affiliates, as the case may be, shall reasonably require to permit PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, BDO USA, LLP and each of their respective Affiliates, as the case may be, to provide such advice or representation.
 
1.06
    
Release of Escrow Amount.
Following the Escrow Termination Date, the Escrow Amount shall be released from the Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of the Escrow and Paying Agent Agreement, which will provide also that 50% of the Escrow Amount will be released from the Escrow Account to the Sellers on the date that is nine (9) months following the Closing Date.

de minimis
amount of money to remedy any breach of any representation or warranty hereunder, to commence any litigation or arbitration proceeding, to waive or surrender any right, to modify any agreement (including any agreement set forth on Schedule 2.11), to offer or grant any accommodation or concession (financial or otherwise) to any
33
third party, to waive or forego any right, remedy or condition hereunder or to provide financing to the Purchaser for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
7.08
    
Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation; Non-Disparagement.
(a)
    
Ancillary to the consideration reflected within this Agreement, AQ Seller, on behalf of itself and AQ Holdings and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the 
Seller Non-Compete Parties
), agrees that for a period of five (5) years following the Closing Date each Seller Non-Compete Party shall not, directly or indirectly, (A) engage in or participate (including, without limitation, as an investor, officer, employee, director, agent, or consultant) in or on behalf of any entity engaging in any line of business competitive with the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as conducted on the Closing Date (the 
SRO Business
) or (B) in any capacity, directly or indirectly call on, service or solicit SRO Business from customers of the Company or its Subsidiaries (the 
Seller Non-Compete Obligations
),
provided
,
however
, that nothing herein shall prevent a Seller Non-Compete Party from investing as a less than 2.5% shareholder in securities of any company listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on an automated quotation system. The geographic limitation for the Seller Non-Compete Obligations is any state or province (or substantially equivalent designation of a geographic area within a foreign country) in which the Company or its Subsidiaries conduct the SRO Business during the twelve (12) months prior to the Closing Date.
(b)
    
Each of the Sellers agrees, on behalf of itself and its Seller Restricted Parties, that for a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, such Seller and its respective Seller Restrictive Parties will not, directly or indirectly, (i) induce or solicit any person who was an executive or senior management employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries during the six (6) months preceding the date of such solicitation to terminate such individuals employment or service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) hire or retain the services of any such person, regardless of whether such person had been solicited for employment or (iii) assist any other person or entity in such activities;
provided
that no action taken by any portfolio company that is an Affiliate of any Seller or its respective Seller Restrictive Parties, which action is taken independently by such portfolio company and not at the direction or initiation of, or in consultation with, such Seller or its respective Seller Restrictive Parties, shall constitute a violation of the foregoing restrictions;
provided
further
that general solicitations for employment (including the use of advertisements and employment or recruiting agencies not directed to target the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), and the hiring of individuals who respond to such general solicitations, shall not constitute a violation of the foregoing restrictions.
(c)
    
Each of the Sellers, on behalf of itself and its Seller Restricted Parties, agrees for a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date not to, directly (or through any other person or entity) make any public or private statements (whether orally or in writing) that disparage, denigrate or malign the Purchaser or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, their respective businesses, activities, operations, affairs, reputations or prospects or any of their respective officers, employees, directors, partners, members, agents or shareholders. Nothing in this
Section 7.08(c)
shall limit any Sellers or any of its Seller Restricted Parties ability to make true and accurate statements or communications in connection with any disclosure such Person reasonably believe is required pursuant to applicable Law, in response to incorrect, disparaging or derogatory public
34
statements to the extent reasonably necessary to correct or refute such public statements or in
35
connection with any dispute, litigation or other proceeding related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
(d)
    
If, in any judicial proceeding, the court shall refuse to enforce any of the separate covenants contained in this
Section 7.08
because the time limit is too long, it is expressly understood and agreed between the Seller Restricted Parties and Purchaser that for purposes of such proceeding such time limitation shall be deemed reduced to the extent necessary to permit enforcement of such covenants. If, in any judicial proceeding, the court shall refuse to enforce any of the separate covenants contained in this
Section 7.08
because they are more extensive (whether as to geographic area, scope of business or otherwise) than necessary to protect the business and goodwill of Purchaser and/or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries), it is expressly understood and agreed between the Seller Restricted Parties and Purchaser that for purposes of such proceeding the geographic area, scope of business or other aspect shall be deemed reduced to the extent necessary to permit enforcement of such covenants.

provided
that the foregoing shall not restrict any amendment to the organizational documents of any of the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with any merger of such Person with and into any other Affiliate of the Purchaser (or in connection with any other internal reorganization of the Purchaser and its Affiliates) to the extent that (i) the organizational documents of the Person surviving such merger (or other internal reorganization) contain provisions with respect to the indemnification and exculpation of, and the advancement of expenses to, the relevant Indemnified Persons to the

by the Purchaser, on the one hand, or by the Representative, on the other hand, upon the issuance by any Governmental Body of an order, decree or ruling restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or declaring unlawful the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which order, decree or ruling shall have become final and non appealable;

);
provided

Section 10.01(c)
;
(r)
    
by the Purchaser, upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of the Company or any Seller set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the Company, any of the Sellers or any of the Blocker Corps is discovered to be or shall have become untrue, in each case, such that the conditions set forth in

or
Section 9.01(b)
would not be satisfied;
provided
,
however
, that, (i) if such breach is curable by the Company, such Seller or such Blocker Corp, then the Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement under this

th
) day) and (ii) the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this

Section 10.02
, for all purposes of this
ARTICLE X

Section 1.04

Section 10.01(e)

Section 10.02(b)

Section 10.02
, the Purchaser shall conclusively be deemed obligated to consummate the Closing and to make the payments required by

In order for a party (the

Third Party Claim
), such Indemnified Party must notify (i) the Purchaser, in the case of indemnification pursuant to
Section 11.04
, or (ii) each Seller from which indemnification is being sought, in the case of indemnification pursuant
47
to
Section 11.02
and
Section 13.05(a)
(in each case, as applicable, the 
Indemnifying Party
) (with a copy, in the case of clause (ii), to the Representative), in each case, in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third Party Claim as promptly as reasonably possible after receipt, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after such Indemnified Partys knowledge of such Third Party Claim;
provided
that failure to give such notification on a timely basis shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party (with a copy, where the Indemnifying Party is a Seller, to the Representative), within five (5) Business Days after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim;
provided
that failure to give such notification on a timely basis shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.
(h)
    
If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof at its expense with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party if it gives notice to the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim from the Indemnified Party of its intention to do so;
provided
that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or maintain control of the defense of any Third Party Claim if (i) such Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation; or (ii) such Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume such defense, the Indemnifying Party shall continue to have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from any counsel employed by the Indemnified Party, it being understood that the Indemnified Party shall control such defense. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense, and the Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to indemnification for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof;

All the parties hereto that are party to, or an Indemnifying Party with respect to, any Third Party Claim shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include: (x) retaining and providing to the Indemnifying Party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, (y) assisting with the collection and preparation of discovery materials, and (z) making employees and other representatives and advisors available on a mutually convenient basis to prepare for or appear as witnesses at depositions, court proceeds or trials and to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

Settling Party
) shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, respectively (the 
Non-Settling Party
) (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim unless (i) the claimant and the Settling Party provide to the Non-Settling Party an unqualified release from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, (ii) such settlement or compromise does not contain any admission of liability or wrongdoing by such Non-Settling Party and (iii) such settlement or compromise does not impose any sanctions, restrictions or obligations (including the payment of money damages, unless the Settling Party will be solely responsible for all of such money damages) on the Non-Settling Party.
(j)
    
The Representative shall act on behalf of all Sellers as Indemnifying Parties in the case of all Third Party Claims with respect to which a Purchaser Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification pursuant to
Section 11.02(a)
,
Section 11.02(d)
or
Section 13.05(a)
(other than Tax Proceedings, which are the subject of
Section 13.03(b)

Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims.
The Indemnified Party shall deliver written notice to the Indemnifying Party promptly upon its discovery of any matter for which the Indemnifying Party may be liable to the Indemnified Party hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim (a Non-Third Party Claim), which written notice shall also (a) state in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances related to such Loss and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or claim to which such Loss is related, (b) that the Indemnified Party has paid or properly accrued Losses or reasonably expects that it will incur liability for Losses for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement (and, to the extent known or reasonably calculable, the Indemnified Partys good faith estimate of the amount of its Losses) and (c) the date such item was paid or accrued. The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation shall include retaining and providing the Representative and its representatives, upon reasonable advance notice and during regular business hours, with reasonable access to (y) all books, records and other documents (including work papers, memoranda, financial statements, Tax Returns, Tax schedules and work papers, Tax rulings, and other determinations, etc.) relating to or containing information relevant to such claim in their possession and (z) the Purchasers and the Companys employees, accountants and other professional advisors (including making the Companys chief financial officer, accountants and attorneys available to respond to reasonable written or oral inquiries of the Representative and its representatives).

49
arrangements (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Tax distributions received by any Blocker Corp directly or indirectly from AQ Holdings) (collectively,

provided
, that such cooperation shall not include any requirement of AQ Seller to expend money, commence any litigation or arbitration proceeding or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party.

Insurance Matters.
Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, as of the Closing Date, the coverage under all insurance policies maintained by AQ Seller or any of its Affiliates, including those set forth on Schedule 2.15 as being maintained by AQ Seller for the benefit of the Company, shall continue in force solely only for the benefit of AQ Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) and not for the benefit of the Purchaser or its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries). The Purchaser agrees to arrange for its own insurance policies with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries and the SRO Business covering all periods following the Closing Date and agrees not to seek, through any means, to benefit from any of the insurance policies maintained by AQ Seller or its Affiliates with respect to such period set forth on Schedule 2.15, provided that the foregoing shall not restrict the Purchaser with respect to any Pre-Closing Claims. Following the Closing, AQ Seller shall provide to Purchaser and the Company and its Subsidiaries, access to and, upon reasonable request, information with respect to, all occurrence-based liability insurance policies on Schedule 2.15 that have provided coverage to any of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including general liability, workers compensation insurance policies, and any other occurrence-based liability insurance policies, provided that such access shall not unreasonably interfere with the business of AQ Seller or its Affiliates. Such insurance, to the extent provided in the applicable policies, shall be available to cover the Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent any claims are asserted that arise out of the operations of Company and its Subsidiaries and the SRO Business prior to Closing, subject in each case, to the terms and limitations of such policies (Pre-Closing Claims). If any Pre-Closing Claim is asserted after the Closing, the Purchaser or its Affiliates shall be responsible to pay all deductibles, expenses, self-retention amounts, premium adjustments, litigation expenses or other costs as required under the applicable insurance policies and all costs of prosecution or collection thereof. AQ Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Purchaser and the Company and its Subsidiaries in any of their efforts to avail themselves of coverage under any such applicable insurance policies with respect to Pre-Closing Claims, but it shall be the responsibility of the Company or its Subsidiaries to submit claims directly to the applicable insurers. For purposes of this Section 12.07, the reasonable best efforts of AQ Seller shall not require the AQ Seller or its Affiliates or representatives to expend any money, incur any liability, commence any litigation or arbitration proceeding, waive or surrender any right, modify any agreement, or to offer or grant any accommodation or concession (financial or otherwise) to any third party or to otherwise suffer any detriment.
12.08
    
Cancellation of Intercompany Accounts and Services.

60
and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the Company or its Subsidiaries), on the other hand, including any agreements or understandings (written or oral) with respect thereto, shall be cancelled and will terminate without any consideration or further action or liability on the part of the parties thereto and without the need for any further documentation. Effective as of the Closing, the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries will no longer have rights to credit cards or payment cards of AQ Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (or the right to use them) and, except as otherwise provided in the Transition Services Agreement, AQ Seller and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall terminate the operation of such cards at or prior to the Closing; provided that the Company shall provide such employees with notice of the termination of such rights at least one (1) Business Day before the Closing Date. Without limiting the generality of the provisions of this Section 12.08, except as otherwise provided in the Transition Services Agreement or the Trademark License Agreement, (i) each party hereto or any of such partys Affiliates shall be permitted to remove any link on any website owned, maintained or controlled by it to any internet website(s) owned, maintained or controlled by the other party or any of such other partys Affiliates without any further action or liability on the part of the removing party and (ii) upon the request of a party hereto, the other party or any of its Affiliates shall promptly remove or cause to be removed any link(s) to any internet web site(s) owned, maintained or controlled by the requesting party on any internet website owned, maintained or controlled by such other party or any of its Affiliates.

Certain Consents.
(i)
    
The Purchaser acknowledges that certain consents to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be required from parties to contracts or other agreements to which the Company or one of its Subsidiaries is a party (including the agreements set forth on
Schedule 2.11
) and that such consents have not been obtained and may not be obtained. The Purchaser agrees that neither the Company nor any of the Sellers nor any of the Blocker Corps shall have any liability whatsoever to the Purchaser (and the Purchaser shall not be entitled to assert any claims) arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consents that may have been or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because of the default, acceleration or termination of or loss of right under any such contract or other agreement as a result thereof. The Purchaser further agrees that no representation, warranty or covenant of the Company or any of the Sellers or any of the Blocker Corps contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached and no condition of the Purchaser shall be deemed not to be satisfied as a result of the failure to obtain any consent or as a result of any such default, acceleration or termination or loss of right or any action commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consent or any such default, acceleration or termination or loss of right. At the Purchasers written request prior to the Closing, the Company shall cooperate with the Purchaser in any reasonable manner in connection with the Purchasers obtaining any such consents;
provided
, that such cooperation shall not include any requirement of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Sellers or Blocker Corps to expend money, commence any litigation or arbitration proceeding or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party. This
Section 12.09(a)

(j)
    
AQ Seller shall either (i) on or prior to Closing, transfer its rights under the agreements listed on
Schedule 12.09(b)
to the Company or (ii) to the extent any of such agreements relate to both the SRO Business and the remaining businesses of AQ Holdings and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), cooperate with the Purchaser in any commercially reasonable manner in connection with the Purchasers efforts to arrange discussions and participate in negotiations with the counterparties to such agreements to enter into separate agreements with the Company or its Subsidiaries;
provided
that such cooperation shall not include any requirement of AQ Seller to expend money, commence any litigation or arbitration proceeding or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party; provided further that any such discussions or negotiations will be initiated by contact from the Company, and not the Purchaser, to such counterparty. To the extent that any such agreement cannot be so transferred without obtaining the consent of any party thereto (other than the AQ Seller or its Affiliates) and either such consent is not obtained or the counterparty to such agreement does not agree to enter into a substantially similar agreement with the Company or its Subsidiaries, AQ Seller will cooperate in a commercially reasonable manner with the Purchaser in any lawful and economically feasible arrangement to provide that the Company shall receive the interest of AQ Seller in all benefits under any such agreement (to the extent such benefits relate to the SRO Business), including without limitation performance by AQ Seller as agent if economically feasible;
provided
,
however
, that the Purchaser shall undertake to pay or satisfy all corresponding Liabilities under such agreement (to the extent such Liabilities relate to the SRO Business), in each case, to the extent the Company or its Subsidiaries would have been responsible therefor if such transfer had been consummated as of the Closing Date. The obligations of AQ Seller under this
Section 12.09(b)
shall terminate and cease to have effect on the date that is the earlier of ninety (90) days following the Closing Date and the expiration or termination of such agreement in accordance with its terms. Each of AQ Seller and the Purchaser shall indemnify the other party for Losses such party or its Affiliates suffer as a result of any breach of any such agreement by such party.

14.11
    
Conflict Between Transaction Documents.
The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that to the extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement are in any way
70
inconsistent with or in conflict with any term, condition or provision of any other agreement, document or instrument contemplated by this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern and control.
14.12
    
No Partnership or Other Relationship Created.
In no event shall this Agreement be deemed to create a partnership between any Seller, any Blocker Corp, the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, and in no event shall any fiduciary or similar duty be deemed owed by any Seller, any Blocker Corp, the Company or any of its Affiliates to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. The parties hereto have voluntarily agreed to define their rights, liabilities and obligations respecting the sale and purchase of the Company and the Blocker Corps exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and provisions of this Agreement; and the parties hereto expressly disclaim that they are owed any duties or are entitled to any remedies not expressly set forth in this Agreement. Furthermore, the parties each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement embodies the justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties derived from arms-length negotiations; all parties to this Agreement specifically acknowledge that no party has any special relationship with another party that would justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary buyer and an ordinary seller in an arms-length transaction.

Specific Performance.
The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary relief, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached, including if the parties hereto fail to take any action required of them hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that (a) the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in Section 14.14 without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement and (b) the right of specific performance and other equitable relief is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, neither the Company nor the Purchaser would have entered into this Agreement. The parties hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific performance or other equitable relief is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 14.13 shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. If, prior to the Termination Date, any party hereto brings any action, in each case in accordance with Section 14.14, to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other party, the Termination Date shall automatically be extended (y) for the period during which such action is pending, plus ten (10) Business Days or (z) by such other time period established by the court presiding over such action, as the case may be. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall this Section 14.13 be used, alone or together with any other provision of
71
this Agreement, to require the Company to remedy any breach of any representation or warranty of the Company made herein.
14.14

AZZ incorporated Signs Agreement to Acquire Aquilex Specialty Repair and Overhaul LLC
An acquisition of a global leader in maintenance, repair and revitalization services to the nuclear and fossil fuel power generation markets as well as the refining and industrial markets.
February 25, 2013
-
Fort Worth, TX
- AZZ incorporated (NYSE: AZZ), a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services, today announced that it has entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement to acquire Aquilex Specialty Repair and Overhaul, LLC ("Aquilex SRO"), a global leader in maintenance, repair and revitalization services to the nuclear and fossil fuel power generation markets, as well as the refining and industrial markets from Aquilex Holdings LLC, which is majority owned by affiliates of Centerbridge Partners, L.P. The acquisition, which is subject to customary closing conditions, including the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, is anticipated to close within approximately 30 days. The acquisition is a part of the stated AZZ strategy to expand our offerings in the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment and to enhance our market presence in our primary served markets. Aquilex SRO's proprietary processes and highly-engineered technology solutions provide unique life extension options for critical plant infrastructure utilizing proprietary automated equipment and a specialized work force.
Founded in 1978 to provide machine welding services for nuclear units and nuclear plant maintenance, Aquilex SRO has continued to expand its service offerings to offer a balanced portfolio of life extension services to the nuclear, fossil, waste to energy, refining, chemical processing, pulp and paper and general industrial markets. Headquartered in Norcross, GA, Aquilex SRO also operates from facilities located in St. Petersburg, FL, Edmonton Alberta, Canada, Radom Poland, Hellevoetsluis The Netherlands and Sao Paulo, Brazil. Aquilex SRO is marketed under the trade names of Aquilex SRO, WSI and SMS. Aquilex HydroChem LLC is not part of this transaction.
"Aquilex SRO is a great addition to AZZ's outstanding portfolio of brands and will be part of the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment. As with our recent acquisition of Nuclear Logistics Incorporated, it provides us with a recurring revenue stream during the full life cycle of a nuclear power generation plant, a fossil fuel plant, a waste-to-energy plant, a refinery or other industrial complex. Approximately one third of its revenues are derived from nuclear power, one third from the fossil fuel and waste-to-energy, and one third from refining, petrochemical, and general industrial. Aquilex SRO's proprietary processes and unique skills truly make them an outstanding provider of highly engineered, customized proven solutions, stated David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of AZZ incorporated.
For the first full year under AZZ, Aquilex revenues are expected to be in the range of $225 to $250 million. AZZ expects the acquisition to be accretive for the first twelve months of ownership of approximately $0.25 to $0.30 per fully diluted share, after accounting for approximately $5 million deal transaction cost that will be written off in the first year of operation. In the second full year of ownership, AZZ anticipates that the accretion will approximate $0.60 to $0.70 per diluted share. It is anticipated that we will update FY 2014 as part of our FY 2013 final earnings announcement and conference call on April 5, 2013. A detailed discussion of the business will also be included in this conference call. The existing senior management team of Aquilex SRO has agreed to join the AZZ leadership team.
The Securities Purchase Agreement provides for the acquisition by AZZ of all of the equity interests of Aquilex SRO for cash consideration in the amount of $250 million. The $250 million will be adjusted for changes in working capital at the time of closing. Funding for the acquisition is to be provided from cash on hand and by a new bank credit agreement, which is anticipated to be entered into by AZZ simultaneously with the closing of the Aquilex SRO acquisition.. The framework of this new credit agreement is currently in place.
Stifel Nicolaus & Company is acting as exclusive financial advisor, and Kelly, Hart and Hallman is acting as legal counsel, to AZZ incorporated in connection with the transaction. Houlihan Lokey is acting as exclusive financial advisor, and Kirkland & Ellis LLP is acting as legal counsel, to Aquilex Specialty Repair and Overhaul LLC.

Section 2 - Financial Information
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On March 27, 2013, AZZ incorporated, a Texas corporation (AZZ), entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer (in such capacity, Bank of America), and the other lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement provides for a $75 million term facility and a $225 million revolving facility, which revolving facility includes a $75 million sublimit for letters of credit and $30 million sublimit for swing line loans. The revolving facility also provides for an accordion feature that allows AZZ to increase the amount of the revolving facility by up to $75 million, subject to securing additional commitments from existing lenders or new lending institutions.
The Credit Agreement replaces that certain Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of May 25, 2006, among AZZ, Bank of America, as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, and certain other lenders, as amended (including Bank of America) (the Previous Credit Agreement), which terminated and ceased to have effect on March 27, 2013. All letters of credit issued under the Previous Credit Agreement have been transferred to the Credit Agreement and will be treated in all respects as if they were issued under the Credit Agreement. AZZ did not incur any early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the Previous Credit Agreement.
AZZ will use funds borrowed under the Credit Agreement to finance the Acquisition (as defined below) and to provide working capital for the entities acquired thereby.
At AZZ's election, loans made under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at either (1) LIBOR or (2) a base rate equal to the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus 0.5%, (b) Bank of America's prime rate and (c) daily floating 30 day LIBOR plus, for either rate, the Applicable Margin (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Applicable Margin is fixed at 1.75% for LIBOR loans and 0.75% for base rate loans until AZZ furnishes Bank of America with its financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2013 and thereafter is based on AZZ's Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement).
AZZ's obligations under the Credit Agreement are unsecured, but all of AZZ's subsidiaries (other than subsidiaries organized in a jurisdiction outside of the United States) have guaranteed such obligations.
The Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including negative covenants that limit or restrict, among other things, dividends, indebtedness, mergers and acquisitions, certain fundamental changes, asset sales, investments, liens and encumbrances, transactions with affiliates, burdensome agreements and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements.

If Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Committed Loan Notice or if
28
Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Revolving Credit Loans or Term Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans. If Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.
(d)
    
Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount of its Applicable Percentage under the applicable Facility of the applicable Revolving Credit Loans or Term Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by Borrower, Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans described in the preceding subsection. In the case of a Revolving Credit Borrowing or the Term Borrowing, each Appropriate Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at Administrative Agents Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the applicable Committed Loan Notice or, as to Loans to be made on the Closing Date as to which Advance Funding Arrangements are in effect, in accordance with the terms thereof. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in
Section 4.02
(and, if such Borrowing is the initial Credit Extension,
Section 4.01
), Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to Borrower in like funds as received by Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of Borrower on the books of Bank of America with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) Administrative Agent by Borrower;
provided
,
however
, that if, on the date the Committed Loan Notice with respect to a Revolving Credit Borrowing is given by Borrower, there are L/C Borrowings outstanding, then the proceeds of such Revolving Credit Borrowing,
first
, shall be applied to the payment in full of any such L/C Borrowings, and
second
, shall be made available to Borrower as provided above.
(e)
    
Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan. During the existence of a Default, no Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans without the consent of the Required Lenders.
(f)
    
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify Borrower and Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, Administrative Agent shall notify Borrower and Lenders of any change in Bank of Americas prime rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change.
(g)
    
After giving effect to (i) all Term Borrowings, all conversions of Term Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Term Loans as the same Type and (ii) all Revolving Credit Borrowings, all conversions of Revolving Credit Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Revolving Credit Loans as the same type, there shall not be more than eight Interest Periods in effect with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Facility.

(B)
    
the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of L/C Issuer applicable to letters of credit generally;

Section 2.16(a)(iv)
) with respect to the Defaulting Lender arising from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or that Letter of Credit and all other L/C Obligations as to which L/C Issuer has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion; or
(G)
    
unless specifically provided for in this Agreement, the Letter of Credit contains any provisions for automatic reinstatement of the stated amount after any drawing thereunder.

L/C Issuer shall not amend any Letter of Credit if L/C Issuer would not be permitted at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof.
(v)
    
L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (A) L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit.
(vi)

(b)
    
Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Extension Letters of Credit.
31
(i)
    
Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of Borrower delivered to L/C Issuer (with a copy to Administrative Agent) in the form of a L/C Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of Borrower. Such L/C Application may be sent by facsimile, by United States mail, by overnight courier, by electronic transmission using the system provided by L/C Issuer, by personal delivery or by any other means acceptable to L/C Issuer. Such L/C Application must be received by L/C Issuer and Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at least two Business Days (or such later date and time as Administrative Agent and L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such L/C Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount and currency thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (G) the purpose and nature of the requested Letter of Credit; and (H) such other matters as L/C Issuer may require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such L/C Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to L/C Issuer (A) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (B) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (C) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (D) such other matters as L/C Issuer may require. Additionally, Borrower shall furnish to L/C Issuer and Administrative Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any Issuer Documents, as L/C Issuer or Administrative Agent may require.
(ii)
    
Promptly after receipt of any L/C Application, L/C Issuer will confirm with Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that Administrative Agent has received a copy of such L/C Application from Borrower and, if not, L/C Issuer will provide Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Revolving Credit Lender, Administrative Agent or any Loan Party, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in
Article IV
shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of Borrower (or the applicable Subsidiary) or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with L/C Issuers usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Revolving Credit Lenders Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage
times
the amount of such Letter of Credit.
(iii)
    
If Borrower so requests in any applicable L/C Application, L/C Issuer may, in its sole discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an 
Auto-Extension Letter of Credit
);
provided
that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at the initial expiry date of such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit and at least once in each twelve-month period thereafter (commencing with the date of the first extension of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the 
Non-Extension Notice Date
) in
32
each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by L/C Issuer, Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to L/C Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Revolving Credit Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the L/C Expiration Date;
provided
,
however
, that L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of
clause (ii)
or
(iii)
of
Section 2.03(a)
or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from Administrative Agent that the Required Revolving Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from Administrative Agent, any Revolving Credit Lender or Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in
Section 4.02
is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing L/C Issuer not to permit such extension.
(iv)
    
Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, L/C Issuer will also deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.
(c)
    
Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.
(i)
    
Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, L/C Issuer shall notify Borrower and Administrative Agent thereof. In the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, Borrower shall reimburse L/C Issuer in such Alternative Currency, unless (A) L/C Issuer (at its option) shall have specified in such notice that it will require reimbursement in Dollars, or (B) in the absence of any such requirement for reimbursement in Dollars, Borrower shall have notified L/C Issuer promptly following receipt of the notice of drawing that Borrower will reimburse L/C Issuer in Dollars. In the case of any such reimbursement in Dollars of a drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, L/C Issuer shall notify Borrower of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly following the determination thereof. Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in Dollars, or the Applicable Time on the date of any payment by L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in an Alternative Currency (each such date, an 
Honor Date
), Borrower shall reimburse L/C Issuer through Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing and in the applicable currency.
(ii)
    
In the event that (A) a drawing denominated in an Alternative Currency is to be reimbursed in Dollars pursuant to the second sentence of
Section 2.03(c)(i)
and (B) the Dollar amount paid by Borrower, whether on or after the Honor Date, shall not be adequate on the date of that payment to purchase in accordance with normal banking procedures a sum denominated in the Alternative Currency equal to the drawing, Borrower agrees, as a separate and independent obligation, to indemnify L/C Issuer for the loss resulting from its inability on that date to purchase the Alternative Currency in the full amount of the drawing. If Borrower fails to so reimburse L/C Issuer on the Honor Date, Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Credit Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the
33
unreimbursed drawing (expressed in Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency) (the 
Unreimbursed Amount
), and the amount of such Revolving Credit Lenders Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage thereof. In such event, Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Credit Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in
Section 2.02
for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolving Credit Commitments and the conditions set forth in
Section 4.02
(other than the delivery of a Committed Loan Notice). Any notice given by L/C Issuer or Administrative Agent pursuant to this
Section 2.03(c)(i)
may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing;
provided
that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.
(iii)
    
Each Revolving Credit Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to
Section 2.03(c)(i)
make funds available (and Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose) for the account of L/C Issuer, in Dollars, at Administrative Agents Office in an amount equal to its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of
Section 2.04(c)(iii)
, each Revolving Credit Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to Borrower in such amount. Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to L/C Issuer in Dollars.
(iv)
    
With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Credit Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in
Section 4.02
cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Revolving Credit Lenders payment to Administrative Agent for the account of L/C Issuer pursuant to
Section 2.03(c)(iii)
shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Revolving Credit Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this
Section 2.03
.
(v)
    
Until each Revolving Credit Lender funds its Revolving Credit Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this
Section 2.03(c)
to reimburse L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Revolving Credit Lenders Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of L/C Issuer.
(vi)
    
Each Revolving Credit Lenders obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this
Section 2.03(c)
, shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Revolving Credit Lender may have against L/C Issuer, Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing;
provided
,
however
, that each Revolving Credit Lenders obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to this
Section 2.03(c)
is subject to the conditions set forth in
Section 4.02
(other than delivery by Borrower of a Committed Loan Notice). No such
34
making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of Borrower to reimburse L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.
(vii)
    
If any Revolving Credit Lender fails to make available to Administrative Agent for the account of L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
Section 2.03(c)
by the time specified in
Section 2.03(c)(iii)
, then, without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Credit Lender (acting through Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by L/C Issuer in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing. If such Revolving Credit Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Revolving Credit Lenders Revolving Credit Loan included in the relevant Revolving Credit Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be. A certificate of L/C Issuer submitted to any Revolving Credit Lender (through Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this
clause (vii)
shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d)
    
Repayment of Participations.
(i)
    
At any time after L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Revolving Credit Lender such Revolving Credit Lenders L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with
Section 2.03(c)
, if Administrative Agent receives for the account of L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by Administrative Agent), Administrative Agent will distribute to such Revolving Credit Lender its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage thereof in Dollars and in the same funds as those received by Administrative Agent.
(ii)
    
If any payment received by Administrative Agent for the account of L/C Issuer pursuant to
Section 2.03(c)(i)
is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in
Section 10.05
(including pursuant to any settlement entered into by L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Revolving Credit Lender shall pay to Administrative Agent for the account of L/C Issuer its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage thereof in Dollars on demand of Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Revolving Credit Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Revolving Credit Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.
(e)
    
Obligations Absolute.
The obligation of Borrower to reimburse L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following:
35
(i)
    
any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document;
(ii)
    
the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction;
(iii)
    
any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit;
(iv)
    
waiver by L/C Issuer of any requirement that exists for L/C Issuers protection and not the protection of Borrower or any waiver by L/C Issuer which does not in fact materially prejudice Borrower;
(v)
    
honor of a demand for payment presented electronically even if such Letter of Credit requires that demand be in the form of a draft;
(vi)
    
any payment made by L/C Issuer in respect of an otherwise complying item presented after the date specified as the expiration date of, or the date by which documents must be received under such Letter of Credit if presentation after such date is authorized by the UCC, the ISP or the UCP, as applicable;
(vii)
    
any payment by L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law;
(viii)
    
any adverse change in the relevant exchange rates or in the availability of the relevant Alternative Currency to Borrower or any Subsidiary or in the relevant currency markets generally; or
(ix)
    
any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, Borrower or any Subsidiary.
Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with Borrowers instructions or other irregularity, Borrower will immediately notify L/C Issuer. Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.
36
(f)
    
Role of L/C Issuer.
Each Revolving Credit Lender and Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of L/C Issuer, Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Revolving Credit Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Revolving Credit Lenders or the Required Revolving Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit;
provided
,
however
, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude Borrowers pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of L/C Issuer, Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in
clauses (i)
through
(ix)
of
Section 2.03(e)
;
provided
,
however
, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, Borrower may have a claim against L/C Issuer, and L/C Issuer may be liable to Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by Borrower which Borrower proves were caused by L/C Issuers willful misconduct or gross negligence or L/C Issuers willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. L/C Issuer may send a Letter of Credit or conduct any communication to or from the beneficiary via the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) message or overnight courier, or any other commercially reasonable means of communicating with a beneficiary.
(g)
    
Applicability of ISP and UCP; Limitation of Liability.
Unless otherwise expressly agreed by L/C Issuer and Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), (i) the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the UCP shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, L/C Issuer shall not be responsible to Borrower for, and L/C Issuers rights and remedies against Borrower shall not be impaired by, any action or inaction of L/C Issuer required or permitted under any law, order, or practice that is required or permitted to be applied to any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, including the Law or any order of a jurisdiction where L/C Issuer or the beneficiary is located, the practice stated in the ISP or UCP, as applicable, or in the decisions, opinions, practice statements, or official commentary of the ICC Banking Commission, the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade - International Financial Services Association (BAFT-IFSA), or the Institute of International Banking Law & Practice, whether or not any Letter of Credit chooses such law or practice.
(h)
    
L/C Fees.
Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Credit Lender in accordance, subject to
Section 2.16
, with its Applicable Revolving Credit
37
Percentage, in Dollars, a L/C Fee (the 
L/C Fee
) for each Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Rate
times
the Dollar Equivalent of the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with

The Swing Line.
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Swing Line Lender, in reliance upon the agreements of the other Revolving Credit Lenders set forth in this
Section 2.04
, may in its sole discretion make loans (each such loan, a 
Swing Line Loan
) to Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during the Availability Period in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that such Swing Line Loans, when aggregated with the Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Credit Loans and L/C Obligations of the Revolving Credit Lender acting as Swing Line Lender, may exceed the amount of such Revolving Credit Lenders Commitment;
provided
,
however
, that (x) after giving effect to any Swing Line Loan, (i) the Total Revolving Credit Outstandings shall not exceed the Revolving Credit Facility, and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Credit Loans of any Revolving Credit Lender at such time,
plus
such Revolving Credit Lenders Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations,
plus
such Revolving Credit Lenders Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans at such time shall not exceed such Revolving Credit Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment, (y) Borrower shall not use the proceeds of any Swing Line Loan to refinance any outstanding Swing Line Loan, and (z) Swing Line Lender shall not be under any obligation to make any Swing Line Loan if it shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that it has, or by such Credit Extension may have, Fronting Exposure. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, Borrower may borrow under this
Section 2.04
, prepay under
Section 2.05
, and reborrow under this
Section 2.04
. Each Swing Line Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan. Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from Swing Line Lender a risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of such Revolving Credit Lenders Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage
times
the amount of such Swing Line Loan.
(d)
    
Borrowing Procedures.
Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made upon Borrowers irrevocable notice to Swing Line Lender and Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be received by Swing Line Lender and Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify (i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $100,000, and (ii) the requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day. Each such telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by delivery to Swing Line Lender and Administrative Agent of a written Swing Line Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of Borrower. Promptly after receipt by Swing Line Lender of any telephonic Swing Line Loan Notice, Swing Line Lender will confirm with Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that Administrative Agent has also received such Swing Line Loan Notice and, if not, Swing Line Lender will notify Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof. Unless Swing Line Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Revolving Credit Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A) directing Swing Line Lender not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the first proviso to the first sentence of
Section 2.04(a)
, or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in
Article IV
is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Swing Line Lender will, not later than 3:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Swing Line Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to Borrower at its office by crediting the account of Borrower on the books of Swing Line Lender in immediately available funds.
(e)
    
Refinancing of Swing Line Loans.
39
(i)
    
Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole discretion may request, on behalf of Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes Swing Line Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Revolving Credit Lender make a Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to such Revolving Credit Lenders Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the amount of Swing Line Loans then outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Committed Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of
Section 2.02
, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Revolving Credit Commitments and the conditions set forth in
Section 4.02
. Swing Line Lender shall furnish Borrower with a copy of the applicable Committed Loan Notice promptly after delivering such notice to Administrative Agent. Each Revolving Credit Lender shall make an amount equal to its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the amount specified in such Committed Loan Notice available to Administrative Agent in immediately available funds (and Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral available with respect to the applicable Swing Line Loan) for the account of Swing Line Lender at Administrative Agents Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Committed Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to
Section 2.04(c)(ii)
, each Revolving Credit Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to Borrower in such amount. Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to Swing Line Lender.
(ii)
    
If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Revolving Credit Borrowing in accordance with
Section 2.04(c)(i)
, the request for Base Rate Loans submitted by Swing Line Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by Swing Line Lender that each of the Revolving Credit Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Lenders payment to Administrative Agent for the account of Swing Line Lender pursuant to
Section 2.04(c)(i)
shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation.
(iii)
    
If any Revolving Credit Lender fails to make available to Administrative Agent for the account of Swing Line Lender any amount required to be paid by such Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
Section 2.04(e)
by the time specified in
Section 2.04(c)(i)
, Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Credit Lender (acting through Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by Swing Line Lender in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by Swing Line Lender in connection with the foregoing. If such Revolving Credit Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Revolving Credit Lenders Revolving Credit Loan included in the relevant Revolving Credit Borrowing or funded participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan, as the case may be. A certificate of Swing Line Lender submitted to any Revolving Credit Lender (through Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this
clause (iii)
shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

provided
,
however
, that each Revolving Credit Lenders obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to this
Section 2.04(c)
is subject to the conditions set forth in
Section 4.02
. No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of Borrower to repay Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided herein.
(f)
    
Repayment of Participations.
(i)
    
At any time after any Revolving Credit Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if Swing Line Lender receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Revolving Credit Lender its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by Swing Line Lender.
(ii)
    
If any payment received by Swing Line Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to be returned by Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances described in
Section 10.05
(including pursuant to any settlement entered into by Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Revolving Credit Lender shall pay to Swing Line Lender its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage thereof on demand of Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of Swing Line Lender. The obligations of the Revolving Credit Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.
(g)
    
Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender.
Swing Line Lender shall be responsible for invoicing Borrower for interest on the Swing Line Loans. Until each Revolving Credit Lender funds its Base Rate Loan or risk participation pursuant to this
Section 2.04

Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lenders ratable portion of such prepayment (based on such Lenders Applicable Percentage in respect of the relevant Facility). If such notice is given by Borrower, Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein.

Sections 7.05(a)
through
7.05(f)
)
which results in the realization by such Person of Net Cash Proceeds, Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Term Loans equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds promptly upon receipt thereof by such Person (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in
clause (v)
below);
provided
,
however
, that, with respect to any Net Cash Proceeds realized under a Disposition described in this
Section 2.05(b)(i)
, at the election of Borrower (as notified by Borrower to Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of such Disposition), and so long as no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Borrower or such Subsidiary may reinvest all or any portion of such Net Cash Proceeds in operating assets so long as within 180 days after the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, such purchase shall have been consummated (as certified by Borrower in writing to Administrative Agent); and

(v)
    
If at any time (and if after giving effect to such incurrence or issuance) the Leverage Ratio is greater than 2.75 to 1.00, Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries incurs or issues any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness expressly permitted to be incurred or issued pursuant to

and such prepayment would be due on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loans, then, so long as no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such prepayment may be deferred until the last day of the applicable Interest Period.
(viii)
    
If for any reason the Total Revolving Credit Outstandings at any time exceed the Revolving Credit Facility at such time, Borrower shall immediately prepay the Revolving Credit Facility, the Swing Line Loans and L/C Borrowings and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations (other than the L/C Borrowings) in an aggregate amount equal to such excess;
provided

times
the actual daily amount by which the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments exceed the sum of (i) the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Credit Loans and (ii) the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations, subject to adjustment as provided in
Section 2.16
. For the avoidance of doubt, the Outstanding Amount of Swing Line Loans shall not be counted towards or considered usage of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments for purposes of determining the commitment fee. The commitment fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period, including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in
Article IV
is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September
45
and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the last day of the Availability Period. The commitment fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.
(b)
    
Other Fees.
(i)
    
Borrower shall pay to the Arranger and Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.
(ii)
    
Borrower shall pay to Lenders such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.
2.10
    
Computation of Interest and Fees; Retroactive Adjustments of Applicable Rate.
(a)    All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate) shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid,
provided
that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to
Section 2.12(a)
, bear interest for one day. Each determination by Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
(b)    If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of Borrower or for any other reason, Borrower or Lenders determine that (i) the Leverage Ratio as calculated by Borrower as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of the Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, Borrower shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, promptly on demand by Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, automatically and without further action by Administrative Agent, any Lender or L/C Issuer), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period. This paragraph shall not limit the rights of Administrative Agent, any Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under
Section 2.03(c)(iv)
,
2.03(h)
or
2.08(c)
or under
Article VIII
. Borrowers obligations under this paragraph shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment of all other Obligations hereunder.

Evidence of Debt.
46
(a)
    
The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by Lenders to Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through Administrative Agent, Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lenders Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.

In addition to the accounts and records referred to in
subsection (a)
above, each Lender and Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.

Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with
Section 2.02
(or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has
47
made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by
Section 2.02
) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and Borrower severally agree to pay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to Borrower the amount of such interest paid by Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to Administrative Agent.
(i)
    
Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent.
Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to Administrative Agent for the account of Lenders or L/C Issuer hereunder that Borrower will not make such payment, Administrative Agent may assume that Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Appropriate Lenders or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Appropriate Lenders or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or L/C Issuer, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
A notice of Administrative Agent to any Lender or Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this
subsection (b)
shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
(c)
    
Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent.
If any Lender makes available to Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this
Article II
, and such funds are not made available to Borrower by Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in
Article IV
are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.
(d)
    
Obligations of Lenders Several.
The obligations of Lenders hereunder to make Revolving Credit Loans and Term Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans and to make payments under
Section 10.04(c)
are several and not joint. The failure of any
48
Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under
Section 10.04(c)
on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under
Section 10.04(c)
.
(e)
    
Funding Source.
Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.
2.13
    
Sharing of Payments by Lenders.
If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of (a) Obligations in respect of any of the Facilities due and payable to such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations due and payable to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities due and payable to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities due and payable to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time obtained by all Lenders at such time or (b) Obligations in respect of any of the Facilities owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities owing (but not due and payable) to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Parties at such time) of payment on account of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities owing (but not due and payable) to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time obtained by all of Lenders at such time, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (x) notify Administrative Agent of such fact, and (y) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of Obligations in respect of the Facilities then due and payable to Lenders or owing (but not due and payable) to Lenders, as the case may be,
provided
that:
(a)
    
if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and
(b)
    
the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf of Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (y) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in
Section 2.15
, or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans to any assignee or participant, other than an assignment to Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply).
Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation.
49
2.14
    
Increase in Commitments
.
(a)
    
Request for Increase
. Provided there exists no Default, upon at least three (3) Business Days prior notice to Administrative Agent, Borrower may from time to time, request an increase in the Aggregate Commitments (which increase may take the form of an increase to the Revolving Credit Commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility or an increase to the Term Facility) by an amount (for all such requests) not exceeding $75,000,000;
provided
that any such request for an increase shall be in a minimum amount of $10,000,000. At the time of sending such notice, Borrower (in consultation with Administrative Agent) shall specify the Lenders that will be requested to increase their Commitments and the time period within which each such Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to such Lenders). Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each such Lender of such request by Borrower.
(b)
    
Lender Elections to Increase
. Each applicable Lender shall notify Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to increase its Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than the amount requested by Borrower. Any Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment.
(c)
    
Notification by Administrative Agent; Additional Lenders
. Administrative Agent shall notify Borrower and each Lender of the applicable Lenders responses to each request made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of a requested increase and subject to the approval of Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender, Borrower may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Lenders pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent and its counsel.
(d)
    
Effective Date and Allocations
. If the Commitment of any Lender is increased in accordance with this Section, Administrative Agent and Borrower shall determine the effective date (the 
Increase Effective Date
) and the final allocation of such increase. Administrative Agent shall promptly notify Borrower and Lenders of the final allocation of such increase and the Increase Effective Date. If such increase in Commitments results in an increase in the Term Commitments of Term Lenders, the amounts of the installments due on the Term Loans as set forth in
Section 2.07(a)
shall be increased by Administrative Agent (but without the consent of any Lender) on a pro rata basis to reflect such increase.
(e)
    
Conditions to Effectiveness of Increase
. As a condition precedent to such increase, Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent a certificate of each Loan Party dated as of the Increase Effective Date (in sufficient copies for each Lender) signed by a Responsible Officer of such Loan Party (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Loan Party approving or consenting to such increase, and (ii) in the case of Borrower, certifying that, before and after giving effect to such increase, (A) the representations and warranties contained in
Article V
and the other Loan Documents are true and correct on and as of the Increase Effective Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this
Section 2.14
, the representations and warranties contained in
subsections (a)
and
(b)
of
Section 5.05
shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to
subsections (a)
and
(b)
, respectively, of
Section 6.01
, and (B) no Default exists. Borrower shall prepay any Loans
50
outstanding on the Increase Effective Date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to
Section 3.05
) to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Loans ratable with any revised Applicable Percentages arising from any nonratable increase in the Commitments of Lenders under this
Section 2.14
, and each Loan Party shall execute and deliver such documents or instruments as Administrative Agent may require to evidence such increase in the Commitment of any Lender and to ratify each such Loan Partys continuing obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.
(f)
    
Conflicting Provisions
. This Section shall supersede any provisions in
Section 2.13
or
10.01
to the contrary.
2.15
    
Cash Collateral.
(a)
    
Certain Credit Support Events.
If (i) L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, (ii) as of the L/C Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, (iii) Borrower shall be required to provide Cash Collateral pursuant to
Section 8.02
, or (iv) there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, Borrower shall immediately (in the case of
clause (iii)
above) or within one Business Day (in all other cases) following any request by Administrative Agent or L/C Issuer, provide Cash Collateral in an amount not less than the applicable Minimum Collateral Amount (determined in the case of Cash Collateral provided pursuant to
clause (iv)
above, after giving effect to
Section 2.16(a)(iv)
and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender). Additionally, if Administrative Agent notifies Borrower at any time that the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations at such time exceeds 105% of the L/C Sublimit then in effect, then, within two Business Days after receipt of such notice, Borrower shall provide Cash Collateral for the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations in an amount not less than the amount by which the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations exceeds the L/C Sublimit.
(b)
    
Grant of Security Interest.
Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) Administrative Agent, for the benefit of Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer and Lenders, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to
Section 2.15(c)
. If at any time Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than Administrative Agent or L/C Issuer as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, Borrower will, promptly upon demand by Administrative Agent, pay or provide to Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency. All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at Bank of America. Borrower shall pay on demand therefor from time to time all customary account opening, activity and other administrative fees and charges in connection with the maintenance and disbursement of Cash Collateral.
(c)
    
Application.

Section 2.15
or
Sections 2.03

or
8.02
in respect of Letters of Credit shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific L/C Obligations, obligations to fund participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by
51
a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.
(d)
    
Release.
Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure or to secure other obligations shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with
Section 10.06(b)(vi)
)) or (ii) the determination by Administrative Agent and L/C Issuer that there exists excess Cash Collateral;
provided
, however, the Person providing Cash Collateral and L/C Issuer may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations.
2.16
    
Defaulting Lenders.
(a)
    
Adjustments.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:
(i)
    
Waivers and Amendments.
Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of 
Required Lenders
 and
Section 10.01
.
(ii)
    
Defaulting Lender Waterfall.
Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to

shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by Administrative Agent as follows:
first
, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to Administrative Agent hereunder;
second
, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder;

fifth
, if so determined by Administrative Agent and Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lenders potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize L/C Issuers future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with
Section 2.15
;
sixth
, to the payment of any amounts owing to Lenders, L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement;
seventh
, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and
eighth
, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court
52
of competent jurisdiction;
provided
that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Borrowings in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in
Section 4.02
were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Obligations owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Obligations owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans are held by Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments hereunder without giving effect to
Section 2.16(a)(iv)
. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this
Section 2.16(a)(ii)
shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
(iii)
    
Certain Fees.
(A)
    
No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any fee payable under
Section 2.09(a)
for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).
(B)
    
Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive L/C Fees for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to
Section 2.15
.
(C)
    
With respect to any fee payable under
Section 2.09(a)
or any L/C Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to
clause (A)
or
(B)
above, Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lenders participation in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to
clause (iv)
below, (y) pay to L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender, as applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such L/C Issuers or Swing Line Lenders Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.
(iv)
    
Reallocation of Applicable Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure.
All or any part of such Defaulting Lenders participation in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Revolving Credit Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment) but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in
Section 4.02
are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless Borrower shall have otherwise notified Administrative Agent at such time, Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time), and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment. No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become
53
a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lenders increased exposure following such reallocation.
(v)

clause (a)(iv)
above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under applicable Law, (x) first, prepay Swing Line Loans in an amount equal to Swing Line Lenders Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize L/C Issuers Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 2.15

If Borrower, Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages (without giving effect to
Section 2.16(a)(iv)
), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender;
provided
that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and
provided
,
further
, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.

(i)
    
Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Laws. If any applicable Laws (as determined in the good faith discretion of Administrative Agent) require the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by Administrative Agent or a Loan Party, then Administrative Agent or such Loan Party shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding, upon the basis of the information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to
subsection (e)
below.
(ii)
    
If any Loan Party or Administrative Agent shall be required by the Code to withhold or
deduct any Taxes, including both United States Federal backup withholding and withholding taxes, from any payment, then (A) Administrative Agent shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by Administrative Agent to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to
subsection (e)
below, (B) Administrative Agent shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with the Code, and (C) to the extent that
54
the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this
Section 3.01
) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.
(iii)
    
If any Loan Party or Administrative Agent shall be required by any applicable Laws other than the Code to withhold or
deduct any Taxes from any payment, then (A) such Loan Party or Administrative Agent, as required by such Laws, shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by it to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to
subsection (e)
below, (B) such Loan Party or Administrative Agent, to the extent required by such Laws, shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with such Laws, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this

Section 3.01
) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability (such certificate to set out in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to, and a summary calculation of, such amount) delivered to Borrower by a Lender or L/C Issuer (with a copy to Administrative Agent), or by Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or L/C Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each of the Loan Parties shall, and does hereby, jointly and severally indemnify Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 15 days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender or L/C Issuer for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to Administrative Agent as required pursuant to
Section 3.01(c)(ii)
below.
(ii)
    
Each Lender and L/C Issuer shall, and does hereby, severally indemnify, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 15 days after demand therefor, (x) Administrative Agent against any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender or L/C Issuer (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified
55
Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (y) Administrative Agent and the Loan Parties, as applicable, against any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of

in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender and L/C Issuer hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to Administrative Agent under this
clause (ii)
.
(k)

Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent as will enable Borrower or Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements or whether or not payments made hereunder or under any other Loan Documents are subject to Taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in
Section 3.01(e)(ii)(A)
,
3.01(e)(ii)(B)
and
3.01(e)(ii)(D)
below) shall not be required if in the Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
(iii)
    
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(A)
    
any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request
56
of Borrower or Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;
(B)
    
any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower or Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:

Exhibit G-1
to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the meaning of
Section 881(c)(3)(A)
of the Code, a 10 percent shareholder of Borrower within the meaning of
Section 881(c)(3)(B)
of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in
Section 881(c)(3)(C)
of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN; or
(4)
    
to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of
Exhibit G-2
or
Exhibit G-3
, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable;
provided
that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of
Exhibit G-4
on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
(C)
    
any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower or Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such
57
supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit Borrower or Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
(D)
    
if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in
Section 1471(b)
or
1472(b)
of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by
Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i)
of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent as may be necessary for Borrower and Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this
clause (D)
, FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(iv)
    
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this
Section 3.01
expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify Borrower and Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. Each Lender party hereto represents and warrants to each Loan Party that, to such Lenders knowledge, as of the Closing Date, the location of such Lenders Lending Office will not result in payment by any Loan Party of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes.
(m)
    
Treatment of Certain Refunds.
Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or L/C Issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or L/C Issuer, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be. If any Recipient determines that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Loan Party or with respect to which any Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this
Section 3.01
, it shall pay to the applicable Loan Party
an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by a Loan Party under this
Section 3.01
with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund),
provided
that the applicable Loan Party, upon the written request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the applicable Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to the applicable Loan Party
pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person.
58
(n)
    
Survival.
Each partys obligations under this
Section 3.01
shall survive the resignation or replacement of Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or L/C Issuer, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.
3.02
    
Illegality.
If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to Borrower through Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies Administrative Agent and Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component thereof until Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
3.03
    
Inability to Determine Rates.
If in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof (a) Administrative Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, or (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or (b) the Required Lenders determine that for any reason the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, Administrative Agent will promptly so notify Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Eurodollar Rate Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurodollar Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, Borrower may revoke any
59
pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected Eurodollar Rate Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.
3.04
    
Increased Costs; Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans.
(f)
    
Increased Costs Generally.
If any Change in Law shall:
(i)
    
impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement contemplated by
Section 3.04(e)
or L/C Issuer;
(ii)
    
subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in
clauses (b)
through
(d)
of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or
(iii)
    
impose on any Lender or L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon written notice from such Lender or L/C Issuer (such notice to set out in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to and a summary calculation of such increased cost or reduced receipts), Borrower, within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such notice, will pay to such Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(g)
    
Capital or Liquidity Requirements.
If any Lender or L/C Issuer in good faith determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lenders or L/C Issuers holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or L/C Issuers capital or on the capital of such Lenders or L/C Issuers holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or L/C Issuer or such Lenders or L/C Issuers holding company would have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or L/C Issuers policies and the policies of such Lenders or L/C Issuers holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then upon written notice from such Lender or L/C Issuer (such notice to set out the basis for such reduction suffered and a summary calculation of such reduction suffered) to Borrower, Borrower, within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such notice,
60
will pay to such Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or L/C Issuer or such Lenders or L/C Issuers holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(h)
    
Certificates for Reimbursement.
A certificate of a Lender or L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in
subsection (a)
or
(b)
of this
Section
, setting out the basis for such request and a summary calculation thereof, and delivered to Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error asserted by Borrower within five (5) Business Days. Borrower shall pay such Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 15 days after receipt thereof.
(i)
    
Delay in Requests.
Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
Section 3.04
shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders or L/C Issuers right to demand such compensation,
provided
that Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders or L/C Issuers intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
(j)
    
Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans.
Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required in connection with Eurodollar Rate Loans hereunder to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as 
Eurocurrency liabilities
), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan,
provided
Borrower shall have received at least 10 days prior notice (with a copy to Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice 10 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable 10 days from receipt of such notice.
3.05
    
Compensation for Losses.
Upon written demand of any Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent) from time to time, Borrower shall compensate such Lender within fifteen (15) days of such demand for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:
(c)
    
any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
(d)
    
any failure by Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by Borrower;
61
(e)
    
any failure by Borrower to make payment of any drawing under any Letter of Credit (or interest due thereon) denominated in an Alternative Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different currency; or
(f)
    
any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by Borrower pursuant to
Section 10.13
;
including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by Borrower to Lenders under this
Section 3.05
, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded.
3.06
    
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(d)
    
Designation of a Different Lending Office.
If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.04
, or requires Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender, L/C Issuer, or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or L/C Issuer pursuant to
Section 3.01
, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to
Section 3.02
, then at the request of Borrower such Lender or L/C Issuer shall, as applicable, use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the good faith judgment of such Lender or L/C Issuer, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to
Section 3.01
or
3.04
, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to
Section 3.02
, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be. Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or L/C Issuer in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(e)
    
Replacement of Lenders.
If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.04
, or if any Loan Party is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
Section 3.01
and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with
Section 3.06(a)

Administrative Agent
9.01
    
Appointment and Authority.
Each of Lenders and L/C Issuer hereby irrevocably appoints Bank of America to act on its behalf as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of Administrative Agent, Lenders and L/C Issuer, and neither Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.
9.02
    
Rights as a Lender.
The Person serving as Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not Administrative Agent and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to Lenders.
9
9.03
    
Exculpatory Provisions.
Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Administrative Agent:
(h)
    
shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;
86
(i)
    
shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents),
provided
that Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and
(j)
    
shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of Lenders as shall be necessary, or as Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in
Sections 10.01
and
8.02
) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given in writing to Administrative Agent by Borrower, a Lender or L/C Issuer.
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in
Article IV
or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to Administrative Agent.
9.04
    
Reliance by Administrative Agent.
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or L/C Issuer, Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or L/C Issuer unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or L/
87
C Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
9.05
    
Delegation of Duties.
Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more subagents appointed by Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent and any such subagent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such subagent and to the Related Parties of Administrative Agent and any such subagent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.
9.06
    
Resignation of Administrative Agent.
(c)
    
Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to Lenders, L/C Issuer and Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor, which shall be a Lender or its Affiliate or a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States, which successor, if not a Lender or its Affiliate, shall, so long as no Event of Default exists, be approved by Borrower, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the 
Resignation Effective Date
), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) on behalf of Lenders and L/C Issuer, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above and Borrowers approval (if required above).

of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 3.01
,
3.04
,
3.05
, and
10.04
with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment;
provided
, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. Upon request, Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
subsection (d)
of this Section.
99
(i)
    
Register.
Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of Borrower (and such agency being solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at Administrative Agents Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it (or the equivalent thereof in electronic form) and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the 
Register
). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and Borrower, Administrative Agent and Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(j)
    
Participations.
Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, Borrower or Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural Person, a Defaulting Lender or Borrower or any of Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a 
Participant
) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lenders participations in L/C Obligations and/or Swing Line Loans) owing to it);
provided
that (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) Borrower, Administrative Agent, Lenders and L/C Issuer shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under
Section 10.04(c)
without regard to the existence of any participation.
Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to
Section 10.01
that affects such Participant. Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 3.01
,
3.04
and
3.05
to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to
subsection (b)
of this Section (it being understood that the documentation required under
Section 3.01(e)
shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to
paragraph (b)
of this Section;
provided
that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of
Sections 3.06
and
10.13
as if it were an assignee under
paragraph (b)
of this Section and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
Sections 3.01
or
3.04
, with respect to any participation, than the Lender from whom it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at Borrowers request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with Borrower to effectuate the provisions of
Section 3.06
with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of
Section 10.08
as though it were a Lender;
provided
that such Participant agrees to be subject to
Section 2.13
as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address
100
of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register);
provided
that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under
Section 5f.103-1(c)
of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
(k)
    
Certain Pledges.
Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank;
provided
that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
(l)
    
Resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender after Assignment.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time Bank of America assigns all of its Revolving Credit Commitment and Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to
subsection (b)
above, Bank of America may, (i) upon 30 days notice to Borrower and Lenders, resign as L/C Issuer and/or (ii) upon 30 days notice to Borrower, resign as Swing Line Lender. In the event of any such resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among Lenders a successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder;
provided
,
however
, that no failure by Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of Bank of America as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be. If Bank of America resigns as L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to
Section 2.03(c)
). If Bank of America resigns as Swing Line Lender, it shall retain all the rights of Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to
Section 2.04(c)
. Upon the appointment of a successor L/C Issuer and/or Swing Line Lender, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, and (b) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to Bank of America to effectively assume the obligations of Bank of America with respect to such Letters of Credit.
10.07
    
Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality.
Each of Administrative Agent, Lenders and L/C Issuer agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its Related Parties (it being understood that the
101
Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent required or requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over such Person or its Related Parties (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective party (or its Related Parties) to any swap, derivative or other transaction under which payments are to be made by reference to Borrower and its obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder, (g) on a confidential basis to (i) any rating agency in connection with rating Borrower or its Subsidiaries or the credit facilities provided hereunder or (ii) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers or other market identifiers with respect to the credit facilities provided hereunder, (h) with the consent of Borrower or (i) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or any agreement described in the immediately preceding
clause (f)
or (y) becomes available to Administrative Agent, any Lender, L/C Issuer or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than Borrower. For purposes of this Section, 
Information
 means all information received from Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to Administrative Agent, any Lender or L/C Issuer on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by Borrower or any Subsidiary, provided that, in the case of information received from Borrower or any Subsidiary after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. Each of Administrative Agent, Lenders and L/C Issuer acknowledges that (a) the Information may include material non-public information concerning Borrower or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information and (c) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities Laws.

Right of Setoff.

Section 2.16

102
by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer and Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Lender, L/C Issuer and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender, L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender and L/C Issuer agrees to notify Borrower and Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application,

In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.

Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the Advance Funding Documentation, the other Loan Documents, and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to Administrative Agent or L/C Issuer, constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.

e.g.
pdf or tif) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof.

Severability.
If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this
Section 10.12
, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as applicable, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.
10.13
    
Replacement of Lenders.
If Borrower is entitled to replace a Lender pursuant to the provisions of
Section 3.06
, or
if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender, then Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by,
Section 10.06
), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to
Sections 3.01
and
3.04
) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that:

Borrower shall have paid to Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in
Section 10.06(b)
;
(b)
    
such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and L/C Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under
Section 3.05
) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
(c)
    
in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under
Section 3.04
or payments required to be made pursuant to
Section 3.01
, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter;
(d)
    
such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws; and
(e)
    
in the case of an assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

FORM OF GUARANTY
THIS GUARANTY (this 
Guaranty
)
is executed as of March [__], 2013, by the undersigned (each, 
Guarantor
), for the benefit of BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., a national banking association, in its capacity as Administrative Agent for the benefit of itself, L/C Issuer, Swing Line Lender, Swap Banks, and Lenders and each of its and their respective successors and permitted assigns (each, 
Benefitted Party
 and collectively, 
Benefitted Parties
).
RECITALS
A.
AZZ incorporated, a Texas corporation (
Borrower
) has entered into a Credit Agreement (as it may be amended, modified, supplemented, or restated from time to time, the 
Credit Agreement
) dated as of March [__], 2013, with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent (in such capacity, 
Administrative Agent
), L/C Issuer (in such capacity, 
L/C Issuer
) and Swing Line Lender (in such capacity, 
Swing Line Lender
),
and the Lenders now or hereafter party to the Credit Agreement (
Lenders
).
B.
This Guaranty is integral to the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents, and the execution and delivery hereof are conditions precedent to Lenders obligations to extend credit under the Loan Documents.
ACCORDINGLY, for adequate and sufficient consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, each Guarantor jointly and severally guarantees to Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Benefitted Parties the prompt payment and performance of the Guaranteed Debt (defined below) when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, upon acceleration, demand, or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, as follows:
Article I.
DEFINITIONS
. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement have the same meanings when used in this Guaranty,
unless
otherwise defined herein. As used in this Guaranty:
Commodity Exchange Act
 means the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C.  1 et seq.), as amended from time to time, and any successor statute.
Excluded Swap Obligation
 means, with respect to any Guarantor, any Swap Obligation if, and to the extent that, all or a portion of the guarantee hereunder by such Guarantor of such Swap Obligation is or becomes illegal under the Commodity Exchange Act or any rule, regulation or order of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (or the application or official interpretation of any thereof) by virtue of such Guarantors failure for any reason to constitute an eligible contract participant as defined in the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder at the time such guarantee of such Guarantor becomes effective with respect to such Swap Obligation. If a Swap Obligation arises under a Master Agreement governing more than one swap, such exclusion shall apply only to the portion of such Swap Obligation that is attributable to swaps for which such guarantee is or becomes illegal.
F-1    Form of Guaranty
Guaranteed Debt
 means, collectively, (a) the Obligations, (b) any and all debts, liabilities, obligations, covenants and duties of any Loan Party arising under any Swap Contract entered into with a Lender or any of its Affiliates at a time that such Lender is a party to the Credit Agreement (whether or not such Lender thereafter ceases to be a party to the Credit Agreement), and (c) all present and future costs, attorneys fees, and expenses incurred by any Benefitted Party to enforce Borrowers, any Guarantors, or any other obligors payment and performance of any of the Guaranteed Debt, in each case whether now existing or hereafter arising, direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, or liquidated or unliquidated, including, without limitation (to the extent lawful), all present and future amounts that would become due but for the operation of any provision of the United States Bankruptcy Code and all present and future accrued and unpaid interest (including, without limitation, all post-maturity interest and any post-petition interest in any proceeding under Debtor Relief Laws to which Borrower or any Guarantor becomes subject, whether or not allowed in any such proceeding). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Guaranteed Debt shall not include any Excluded Swap Obligation.
Swap Obligation
 means, with respect to any Guarantor, any obligation to pay or perform under any Swap Contract that constitutes a swap within the meaning of
Section 1a(47)
of the Commodity Exchange Act.
Article II.
GUARANTY
. This is an absolute, unconditional, irrevocable, and continuing guaranty of payment and performance, and not merely of collection, and the circumstance that at any time or from time to time any Guaranteed Debt may be paid in full does not affect the obligation of each Guarantor with respect to any Guaranteed Debt thereafter incurred. This Guaranty shall remain in effect until the Guaranteed Debt is fully paid and performed, all commitments to extend any credit under the Loan Documents have terminated, all Letters of Credit have expired or been terminated, and all Swap Contracts with any Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender have expired;
provided
that this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case may be, if any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower or any other obligor on any Guaranteed Debt is made, or any Benefitted Party exercises its right of setoff, in respect of any Guaranteed Debt and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by any Benefitted Party) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred. No Guarantor may rescind or revoke its obligations with respect to any Guaranteed Debt. Notwithstanding any contrary provision, it is the intention of each Guarantor and each Benefitted Party that the amount of the Guaranteed Debt guaranteed by each Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be in, but not in excess of, the maximum amount permitted by fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, or similar insolvency Laws applicable to such Guarantor. Accordingly, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Guaranty or any other agreement or instrument executed in connection with the payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Debt, the amount of the Guaranteed Debt guaranteed by each Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render such Guarantors obligations hereunder subject to avoidance under
Section 548
of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of any applicable state Law. The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are those
F-2    Form of Guaranty
of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Guaranteed Debt and the obligations of any other obligor for the Guaranteed Debt.
Article III.
CONSIDERATION
. Each Guarantor represents and warrants that its liability under this Guaranty may reasonably be expected to directly or indirectly benefit it.
Article IV.
CUMULATIVE RIGHTS
. This Guaranty is in addition to and not substitution for any other guaranty given by anyone whomsoever in connection with the Guaranteed Debt or any other indebtedness owing by Borrower to any Benefitted Party. If any Guarantor becomes liable for any indebtedness owing by Borrower to any Benefitted Party, other than under this Guaranty, that liability shall not be in any manner impaired or affected by this Guaranty. The rights of Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Benefitted Parties) under this Guaranty are cumulative of any and all other rights that any Benefitted Party may ever have against each Guarantor. The exercise by Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Benefitted Parties) of any right under this Guaranty or otherwise does not preclude the concurrent or subsequent exercise of any other right.
Article V.
PAYMENT UPON DEMAND
. If an Event of Default exists, each Guarantor shall, on demand and without further notice of dishonor and without any notice having been given to such Guarantor previous to such demand of either the acceptance by any Benefitted Party of this Guaranty or the creation or incurrence of any Guaranteed Debt, pay the amount of the Guaranteed Debt then due and payable to Administrative Agent (for the account of the applicable Benefitted Party or Parties);
provided
that, if an Event of Default exists and Administrative Agent or the applicable Benefitted Party cannot, for any reason, accelerate the applicable Guaranteed Debt, then such Guaranteed Debt shall be, as among each Guarantor, Administrative Agent, and the applicable Benefitted Party, a fully matured, due, and payable obligation of such Guarantor under this Guaranty. It is not necessary for Administrative Agent or any other Benefitted Party, in order to enforce that payment by such Guarantor, first or contemporaneously to institute suit or exhaust remedies against Borrower or others liable on any Guaranteed Debt or to enforce rights against any collateral securing any Guaranteed Debt.
Article VI.
SUBORDINATION
. Each Guarantor hereby subordinates the payment of all obligations and indebtedness of Borrower owing to such Guarantor, whether now existing or hereafter arising, including but not limited to any obligation of Borrower to such Guarantor as subrogee of any Benefitted Party or resulting from such Guarantors performance under this Guaranty, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all Guaranteed Debt. If Administrative Agent so requests, any such obligation or indebtedness of Borrower to such Guarantor shall be enforced and performance received by such Guarantor as trustee for the applicable Benefitted Party or Parties and the proceeds thereof shall be paid over to Administrative Agent on account of the Guaranteed Debt, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of such Guarantor under this Guaranty.
Article VII.
SUBROGATION AND CONTRIBUTION
. Until payment in full of the Guaranteed Debt, the termination of the obligation of Lenders to extend credit under the Loan Documents, and expiration of all Swap Contracts between any Loan Party and any Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender, (a) no Guarantor may assert, enforce, or otherwise exercise any right of subrogation to any of the rights of any Benefitted Party against Borrower or any other obligor on the Guaranteed Debt or any collateral or
F-3    Form of Guaranty
other security or any right of recourse, reimbursement, subrogation, contribution, indemnification, or similar right against Borrower or any other obligor on any Guaranteed Debt, (b) each Guarantor defers all of the foregoing rights (whether they arise in equity, under contract, by statute, under common law, or otherwise), and (c) each Guarantor defers the benefit of, and subordinates any right to participate in, any collateral or other security given to any Benefitted Party to secure payment of any Guaranteed Debt.
Article VIII.
NO RELEASE
. No Guarantors obligations under this Guaranty shall be released, diminished, or affected by the occurrence of any one or more of the following events: (a) any taking or accepting of any collateral or other security for any Guaranteed Debt; (b) any release, surrender, exchange, subordination, impairment, or loss of any collateral or other security for any Guaranteed Debt; (c) any full or partial release of the liability of any other obligor on any Guaranteed Debt, except for any final release resulting from payment in full of such Guaranteed Debt; (d) the amendment or modification of, or waiver of compliance with, any terms of any Loan Document, Swap Contract or other document or instrument executed and delivered in connection with any Guaranteed Debt; (e) the insolvency, bankruptcy, or lack of corporate or partnership power of any other obligor at any time liable for any Guaranteed Debt, whether now existing or occurring in the future; (f) any renewal, extension, or rearrangement of any Guaranteed Debt or any adjustment, indulgence, forbearance, or compromise that may be granted or given by any Benefitted Party to any other obligor on the Guaranteed Debt; (g) any neglect, delay, omission, failure, or refusal of any Benefitted Party to take or prosecute any action in connection with the Guaranteed Debt or to foreclose, take, or prosecute any action in connection with any Loan Document, Swap Contract or other document or instrument executed and delivered in connection with any Guaranteed Debt; (h) any failure of any Benefitted Party to notify any Guarantor of any renewal, extension, or assignment of any Guaranteed Debt, or the release of any collateral or other security for any Guaranteed Debt or of any other action taken or refrained from being taken by any Benefitted Party against Borrower or any other obligor on any Guaranteed Debt or any new agreement between any Benefitted Party and Borrower or any other obligor on any Guaranteed Debt, it being understood that no Benefitted Party shall be required to give any Guarantor any notice of any kind under any circumstances whatsoever with respect to or in connection with any Guaranteed Debt, other than any notice required to be given to such Guarantor by Law or elsewhere in this Guaranty; (i) the unenforceability of any Guaranteed Debt against any other obligor or any collateral or other security for any Guaranteed Debt because it exceeds the amount permitted by Law, the act of creating it is
ultra vires
, the officers creating it exceeded their authority or violated their fiduciary duties in connection with it, or otherwise; (j) any payment of any Guaranteed Debt to any Benefitted Party is held to constitute a preference under any Debtor Relief Law or for any other reason any Benefitted Party is required to refund that payment or make payment to someone else (and in each such instance this Guaranty will be reinstated in an amount equal to that payment); or (k) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense against, or a legal or equitable discharge of, any Guarantors liability under this Guaranty, except payment of the Guaranteed Debt.
Article IX.
WAIVERS
. Each Guarantor waives (a) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of the Borrower or any other obligor for any Guaranteed Debt, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of any Benefitted Party) of the liability of the Borrower or any other obligor for any Guaranteed Debt; (b) any defense based on any claim that such Guarantors
F-4    Form of Guaranty
obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of the Borrower or any other obligor for the Guaranteed Debt; (c) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Guarantors liability hereunder; and (d) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all other defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by applicable law limiting the liability of or exonerating guarantors or sureties. Each Guarantor expressly waives all setoffs and counterclaims and all presentments, demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Guaranteed Debt, and all notices of acceptance of this Guaranty or of the existence, creation or incurrence of new or additional Guaranteed Debt. It shall not be necessary for any Benefitted Party (and each Guarantor hereby waives any rights that such Guarantor may have to require any Benefitted Party), in order to enforce such payment hereunder by such Guarantor, first to (i) institute suit or exhaust its remedies against Borrower or any other obligor liable on any Guaranteed Debt, (ii) enforce or exhaust any Benefitted Partys rights against any collateral or other security which shall ever have been given to secure any Guaranteed Debt, (iii) enforce any Benefitted Partys rights against any other guarantor of any Guaranteed Debt, (iv) join Borrower or any other obligor liable on any Guaranteed Debt in any action seeking to enforce this Guaranty, or (v) resort to any other means of obtaining payment of any Guaranteed Debt. No Benefitted Party shall not be required to mitigate damages or take any other action to reduce, collect, or enforce any Guaranteed Debt. Further, each Guarantor expressly waives each and every right to which it may be entitled by virtue of the suretyship law of the State of Texas, including without limitation
,
any rights pursuant to
Chapter 43
of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, as amended
, Rule 31
of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, and
Section 17.001
of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, as amended.
Article X.
LOAN DOCUMENTS
. By execution hereof, each Guarantor covenants and agrees that certain representations, warranties, terms, covenants, and conditions set forth in the Loan Documents are incorporated herein by reference and are applicable to Guarantor as a Loan Party and shall be imposed upon such Guarantor as a Loan Party, and such Guarantor reaffirms that each such representation and warranty is true and correct and covenants and agrees to promptly and properly perform, observe, and comply with each such term, covenant, or condition. Moreover, each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that this Guaranty is subject to the offset provisions of the Credit Agreement in favor of L/C Issuer, Swing Line Lender and each Lender. In the event the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document shall cease to remain in effect for any reason whatsoever during any period when any part of the Guaranteed Debt remains unpaid, the terms, covenants, and agreements of the Credit Agreement or such other Loan Document incorporated herein by reference shall nevertheless continue in full force and effect as obligations of such Guarantor under this Guaranty.
Article XI.
RELIANCE AND DUTY TO REMAIN INFORMED
. Each Guarantor confirms that it has executed and delivered this Guaranty after reviewing the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents and such other information as it has deemed appropriate in order to make its own credit analysis and decision to execute and deliver this Guaranty. Each Guarantor confirms that it has made its own independent investigation with respect to Borrowers creditworthiness and is not executing and delivering this Guaranty in reliance on any representation or warranty by any Benefitted Party as to such creditworthiness. Each Guarantor expressly assumes all responsibilities to remain informed of the
F-5    Form of Guaranty
financial condition of Borrower and any circumstances affecting Borrowers ability to pay and perform the Guaranteed Debt.
Article XII.
NO REDUCTION
. The Guaranteed Debt may not be reduced, discharged, or released because or by reason of any existing or future offset, claim, or defense (except for the defense of complete and final payment of the Guaranteed Debt) of Borrower or any other obligor against any Benefitted Party or against payment of the Guaranteed Debt, whether that offset, claim, or defense arises in connection with the Guaranteed Debt or otherwise. Those claims and defenses include, without limitation, failure of consideration, breach of warranty, fraud, bankruptcy, incapacity/infancy, statute of limitations, lender liability, accord and satisfaction, usury, forged signatures, mistake, impossibility, frustration of purpose, and unconscionability.
Article XIII.
INSOLVENCY OF GUARANTOR.
Should any Guarantor become insolvent, or fail to pay such Guarantors debts generally as they become due, or voluntarily seek, consent to, or acquiesce in, the benefit or benefits of any Debtor Relief Law (other than as a creditor or claimant), or become a party to (or be made the subject of) any proceeding provided for by any Debtor Relief Law (other than as a creditor or claimant) that could suspend or otherwise adversely affect the rights of any Benefitted Party granted hereunder, then, in any such event (each such event, an
Insolvency Default
), the Guaranteed Debt shall be, as among such Guarantor and each Benefitted Party, a fully matured, due, and payable obligation of such Guarantor to each Benefitted Party (without regard to whether Borrower is then in default under the Loan Documents, any Swap Contract or any other document or instrument executed and delivered in connection with the Guaranteed Debt or whether the Guaranteed Debt, or any part thereof, is then due and owing by Borrower to any Benefitted Party), payable in full by such Guarantor to Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the applicable Benefitted Party or Parties) upon demand, and the amount thereof so payable shall be the estimated amount owing in respect of the contingent claim created hereunder.

AZZ incorporated Reports Results for the Fourth Quarter and Year-To-Date of Fiscal Year 2013 and Declares Dividend

Increased 47% and Backlog Increased 60% when compared to the same period last year

FORT WORTH, TX
- AZZ incorporated
(NYSE:AZZ)
, (the "Company" or "AZZ") a manufacturer of electrical products and a provider of galvanizing services, today announced unaudited financial results for the three and twelve-month periods ended February 28, 2013. Revenues for the fourth quarter were $140.4 million compared to $123.6 million for the same quarter last year, an increase of 14 percent. Net income for the fourth quarter was $13.2 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, compared to net income of $11.6 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, in last year's fourth fiscal quarter. During the fourth quarter the company recorded a gain on insurance proceeds of $3.1 million resulting from a fire at the Joliet galvanizing facility. This gain was partially offset by a loss recorded as a result of the consolidation of our Wheeling galvanizing facility with our Canton, Ohio location in the amount of $1.3 million as well as a loss at our Joliet galvanizing facility for business interruption costs incurred in the amount of $1.0 million. Earnings per share for the quarter without these non-recurring items would have been $0.50 per diluted share.
For the twelve-month period, the Company reported revenues of $570.6 million compared to $469.1 million for the comparable period last year, an increase of 22 percent. Net income for the twelve months was $60.5 million, or $2.37 per diluted share, compared to $40.7 million, or $1.61 per diluted share in the comparable period of last year. The net income and earnings per diluted share for the first twelve months reflect a pre-tax gain of approximately $9.1 million related to a partial insurance settlement for assets destroyed in a fire at one of the Company's galvanizing facilities.
Backlog at the end of our fourth quarter was $221.7 million, which includes the favorable impact of Nuclear Logistics Incorporated's acquired backlog. Backlog at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 was $138.6 million. Incoming orders for the fourth quarter were $146.3 million while shipments for the quarter totaled $140.4 million, resulting in a book to ship ratio of 104 percent. Of the backlog of $221.7 million, 35 percent is to be delivered outside of the U.S.
Revenues for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 were $61.9 million as compared to $52.7 million for the same quarter last year, an increase of 18 percent. NLI, acquired June 1, 2012, contributed $17.5 million of this increase. Operating income for the segment increased 21 percent to $9.1 million compared to $7.6 million in the same period last year. NLI contributed $2.9 million
to operating income for the three month period ending February 28, 2013. Operating margins for the fourth quarter were 15 percent for the quarter as compared to 14 percent in the prior year period. For fiscal 2013, revenues increased 23 percent to $233.6 million and operating income increased 33 percent to $34.2 million compared to $189.2 million and $25.8 million respectively, in the prior year period. Operating margin for the 2013 fiscal year was 15 percent as compared to 14 percent in the prior year period.
Revenues for the Company's Galvanizing Service Segment for the fourth quarter were $78.5 million, compared to the $71.0 million in the same period last year, an increase of 11 percent. Operating income was $17.2 million as compared to $18.5 million in the prior period, a decrease of 7 percent. Operating margins for the fourth quarter were 22 percent, compared to 26 percent in the same period last year. The Galvanizing Service Segment incurred two non-operating losses during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 in the total amount of $2.3 million due to the consolidation of the Wheeling facility with the facility located in Canton, Ohio, as well as a loss recorded at Joliet as a result of a fire. Pro forma operating income without these two non-recurring events would have been $19.5 million for the quarter resulting in an operating margin for the segment of 25 percent. For fiscal 2013, revenues increased 20 percent to $337.0 million and operating income increased 20 percent to $87.8 million compared to $279.9 million and $73.0 million respectively, for the twelve months of the prior fiscal year. Year to date operating margins were 26 percent for both fiscal 2013 and 2012. Pro forma year to date operating income as discussed above would have been $92.8 million for the year, yielding a margin of 28 percent.
David H. Dingus, president and chief executive officer of AZZ incorporated, commented, We are extremely proud of our accomplishments for the year, both strategically and operationally. Fiscal Year 2013 was AZZ's twenty-sixth consecutive year of profitability with record revenues and earnings per share. We believe AZZ is well positioned for the future, with a balanced portfolio of products and services as well as a strong balance sheet with superior earnings potential.
Additionally, the Company announced that the Board of Directors, at its regularly scheduled quarterly meeting, declared a $0.14 per share cash dividend on the Company's common stock outstanding. The dividend will be paid at the close of business on May 3, 2013, to shareholders of record on April 19, 2013.
Based upon the evaluation of information currently available to management, we are revising our fiscal year 2014 guidance for revenues to be in the range of $825 to $900 million. Our earnings are anticipated to be in the range of $2.65 and $2.95 per diluted share. The revised guidance reflects the acquisition of Aquilex SRO during the last eleven months of fiscal 2014. The earnings guidance reflects the accretion after the write off of approximately $6 million in one- time cost associated with the acquisition. Additionally, the guidance does not reflect any additional gains which may be realized from the insurance settlement associated with the fire loss at Joliet. Any gains will be recognized in the period in which it is received. The previously issued guidance was for revenues to be in the range of $625 to $660 million and that fully diluted earnings per share to be in the rage of $2.50 to $2.75.
AZZ incorporated will conduct a conference call to discuss financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 at 11:00 A.M. ET on Monday, April 8, 2013. Interested parties can access the conference call by dialing (877) 317-6789 or (412) 317-6789 (international). The call will be web cast via the Internet at www.azz.com/azzinvest/htm.

Section 2.09. Proxies
. (a) At any meeting of the shareholders, every shareholder having the right to vote shall be entitled to vote in person or by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or by his duly authorized attorney-in-fact.

(b)
    
For the purpose of determining whether a majority, or any different required vote of shares present and entitled to vote, has voted affirmatively on a particular question, only those shares voted for or against such questions shall be included in the count. Abstentions and broker non-votes shall not be counted even though such shares shall be considered present and entitled to vote for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum under Section 2.06.
(c)
    
As used in these Bylaws, the term abstention means shares which are not voted for or against a question by a holder or holders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote such shares on the question, and the term broker non-votes means shares represented at a meeting by proxies held by brokers or nominees as to which instructions have not been received from the beneficial owner or persons entitled to vote and as to which the broker or nominee does not have discretionary power to vote on the question.

Section 3.03. Change in Number
. The number of Directors may be increased or decreased from time to time by amendment to these Bylaws, but no decrease shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent Director. Any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of Directors may be filled by the Board or by election at an annual meeting of shareholders or at a special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose.
Any Director elected to the Board to fill a directorship resulting in an increase in the number of Directors shall hold office for a term continuing only until the next election of Directors by shareholders.

The fact that any person is properly nominated for election to the Board of the Corporation by or at the direction of the Board or a committee thereof shall not excuse or eliminate the need of a shareholder to comply with this Section 3.08 in order to properly nominate any person for election to the Board of the Corporation.

For the avoidance of doubt, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must also set forth the information required to be provided pursuant to Section 2.08(d) above.

(b)
    
Subsection (a) of this Section 3.16 shall, however, apply only if the interest of each Director, officer or shareholder is known or disclosed:

On March 29, 2013, AZZ completed its acquisition (the Acquisition) of Aquilex Specialty Repair and Overhaul LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (Aquilex SRO), pursuant to the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement dated February 22, 2013 (the Purchase Agreement) by and among Aquilex SRO, Aquilex LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, AZZ, Arbor-Crowley, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of AZZ, and the other parties identified therein. The purchase price paid by AZZ in connection with the Acquisition was $276.9 million, subject to adjustment as more fully described in the Purchase Agreement, which purchase price was paid using funds borrowed by AZZ under our existing Credit Agreement.
This Form 8-K/A is being filed to provide the financial statements described below.
SECTION 9                   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
ITEM 9.01                      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
(a)           FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS
Audited consolidated financial statements of Aquilex Specialty Repair and Overhaul LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (Aquilex SRO) as of December 31, 2012 (Successor) and 2011 (Predecessor) and for the periods February 3, 2012 to December 31, 2012 (Successor), January 1, 2012 to February 2, 2012 (Predecessor) and the year ended December 31, 2011 (Predecessor).
(b)           UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated balance sheet as of February 28, 2013 and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2013 are based on the historical financial statements of AZZ and Aquilex SRO after giving effect to the acquisition of Aquilex SRO by AZZ and after applying the assumptions, reclassifications and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements.  On March 29, 2013 AZZ acquired control of Aquilex SRO and it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of AZZ.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements have been prepared by AZZ for illustrative purposes only and reflect the preliminary estimates and assumptions based on information available at the time of preparation, including preliminary fair value estimates of the intangible assets acquired and net liabilities assumed as discussed below.  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements are not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of operations or financial condition of AZZ that would have been reported had the acquisition been completed as of the dates presented and should not be taken as representative of the future consolidated results of operations or financial condition of AZZ.  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements do not reflect any operating efficiencies and/or cost savings that AZZ may achieve with respect to the combined companies.
AZZ and Aquilex SRO have different fiscal year ends.  Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated balance sheet as of February 28, 2013 combines AZZ's historical audited consolidated condensed balance sheet as of February 28, 2013 and Aquilex SRO's historical audited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2012 (Successor) and is presented as if the acquisition of Aquilex SRO had occurred on February 28, 2013. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statement of earnings for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2013 combines the historical results of AZZ for the year ended February 28, 2013 and the historical results of Aquilex SRO for the periods January 1, 2012 to February 2, 2012 (Predecessor), and February 3, 2012 to December 31, 2012 (Successor).  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statements of earnings are presented as if the acquisition had occurred on March 1, 2012.
The acquisition of Aquilex SRO has been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting.  Accordingly, the total estimated purchase price, calculated as described in Note 1 to these unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements, has been allocated on a preliminary basis to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition based on their estimated fair values as of the completion of the acquisition.  These allocations reflect various preliminary estimates and analyses, including preliminary work performed by third-party valuation specialists, and are subject to change during the purchase price allocation period as valuations are finalized.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with AZZ's historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in AZZ's Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended February 28, 2013 and Aquilex SRO's historical audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 which is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K/A.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1.  Basis of Pro Forma Presentation
On March 29, 2013, we completed our acquisition (the Acquisition) of all of the equity securities of Aquilex Specialty Repair and Overhaul LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (Aquilex SRO), pursuant to the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement dated February 22, 2013 (the Purchase Agreement). Aquilex SRO provides the energy industry with specialty repair and overhaul solutions designed to improve mechanical integrity and extend component life. The Acquisition is part of our strategy to expand our offerings in the Electrical and Industrial Products and Services Segment to enhance our presence in the power generation market.
The Purchase Agreement provided for AZZ's acquisition of all equity securities of Aquilex for cash consideration in the amount of $276.9 million, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Purchase Agreement
Under the acquisition method of accounting the total purchase price will be allocated to Aquilex SRO's net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of March 29, 2013, the date on which AZZ acquired control. The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets will be recorded as goodwill.  AZZ has made a preliminary allocation of the estimated purchase price using estimates as described in the introduction to these unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements as follows (in thousands):
Purchase Price Allocation
On February 3, 2012, Aquilex SRO (Predecessor) became majority owned by affiliates of Centerbridge Partners L.P. when it completed a consensual out-of-court financial restructuring with lenders under its First Lien Credit Agreement and Second Lien Credit Agreement and holders. All membership interest of Aquilex Holdings LLC outstanding prior to February 3, 2012 were cancelled. In conjunction with the debt-for-equity exchange, holders of Senior Notes invested $80,000 of new equity in the Parent Company in exchange for new Preferred Units. Proceeds from the cash equity investment were used to pay down debt on the First Lien Credit Agreement and to pay expenses associated with the transaction. The Parent Company's debt was reduced from approximately $441,324 to $136,509 as a result of the transaction. This change in control resulted in a new basis of accounting for Aquilex SRO (Successor). Accordingly, the 2012 historical financial results for Aquilex SRO have been presented for the Successor and Predecessor companies' separately.
Note 2.  Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to conform Aquilex SRO's historical amounts to AZZ's presentation.  These reclassifications relate primarily to reclassifying Aquilex SRO's depreciation and amortization expense and other accrued liabilities which are included in a line item on Aquilex SRO's historical statement of earnings and historical balance sheet to the appropriate line items as presented on AZZ's historical consolidated balance sheet and statement of earnings.

Note 3.  Pro Forma Adjustments
The pro forma adjustments included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements are as follows:
Note 4.  Pro Forma Earnings Per Share
Pro forma earnings per share reflects the combined earnings per share using AZZ weighted common and potentially dilutive shares.

Aquilex Specialty Repair & Overhaul LLC and Subsidiaries
Consolidated Financial Statements
As of December 31, 2012 (Successor) and 2011 (Predecessor) and for the periods February 3, 2012 to December 31, 2012 (Successor), January 1, 2012 to February 2, 2012 (Predecessor), and the year ended December 31, 2011 (Predecessor)
Aquilex Specialty Repair & Overhaul LLC and Subsidiaries
Index to Consolidated Financial Statements
Independent Auditor's Report
To Board of Directors and Members of Aquilex Specialty Repair & Overhaul LLC:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Aquilex Specialty Repair & Overhaul LLC and its subsidiaries (Successor) which comprise the consolidated balance sheet
as of December 31, 2012 and the related statements of operations and other comprehensive income, of changes in member's equity, and of cash flows for the period from February 3, 2012 to December 31, 2012.
Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor's Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the Successor's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Successor's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Aquilex Specialty Repair & Overhaul LLC and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the period from February 3, 2012 to December 31, 2012 in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Predecessor's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Description of Business
Aquilex Specialty Repair & Overhaul LLC (formerly known as Aquilex Specialty Repair & Overhaul , Inc.) and Subsidiaries (the Company or Aquilex SRO) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aquilex LLC (formerly known as Aquilex Corporation), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aquilex Intermediate Holdings LLC, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aquilex Holdings LLC (the ultimate Parent Company). On February 3, 2012, Aquilex Corporation and Aquilex SRO were converted to a limited liability company LLC. The Company is a leading global provider of critical maintenance, repair and construction solutions, including component repair, servicing a diverse base of customers in energy end-markets including nuclear and fossil power generation, refining, chemical processing, pulp and waste-to-energy facilities. The Company provides services through proprietary automation technology, and the Company's services are essential in maintaining and enhancing the efficiency, operability and profitability of customer plants by minimizing downtime and extending service life at a lower cost than replacement alternatives. Specifically, the Company provides specialized welding overlay and repair services for industrial applications of erosion and corrosion protection services, repair technology services, and shop services.
On February 3, 2012, the Parent Company became majority owned by affiliates of Centerbridge Partners L.P. when it completed a consensual out-of-court financial restructuring with lenders under its First Lien Credit Agreement and Second Lien Credit Agreement and holders of the $225,000 11 1/8% Senior Notes due 2016 (Senior Notes). This restructuring resulted in a debt-for-equity exchange where holders of approximately 98.4% of the Senior Notes agreed to exchange their Senior Notes for new Common Units and 100% of lenders under its Second Lien Credit Agreement agreed to exchange their Second Lien Loans for new Preferred Units. All membership interest of Aquilex Holdings LLC outstanding prior to February 3, 2012 were cancelled.. In conjunction with the debt-for-equity exchange, holders of Senior Notes invested $80,000 of new equity in the Parent Company in exchange for new Preferred Units. Proceeds from the cash equity investment were used to pay down debt on the First Lien Credit Agreement and to pay expenses associated with the transaction. The Parent Company's debt was reduced from approximately $441,324 to $136,509 as a result of the transaction. The Company, as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent Company, is now majority owned by affiliates of Centerbridge Partners L.P. The restructuring agreements entered into during 2011 leading to the ultimate consensual out-of-court financial restructuring in 2012 are in Note 2, "Parent Company Restructuring."
Aquilex SRO, as it existed prior to the acquisition of the Parent Company by affiliates of Centerbridge Partners, L.P. and other minority investors on February 3, 2012, is referred to as Predecessor. Aquilex SRO, for the period from and after February 3, 2012 is referred to as the Successor.
On March 9, 2012, the Parent Company initiated a restructuring plan wherein certain upper management positions in the corporate office were eliminated. This restructuring resulted in a more decentralized management setup for purposes of operating the business units separately given the differences in services provided.
The subsidiaries of Aquilex SRO are wholly owned and include Aquilex WSI LLC (formerly, Aquilex WSI, Inc,), Aquilex SMS LLC (formerly, Aquilex SMS, Inc.), Aquilex Welding Services B.V., Aquilex Welding Services Poland Sp. z.o.o, SMS Global, Inc., and Aquilex WSI Canada ULC. On February 3, 2012, Aquilex WSI, Inc. and Aquilex SMS, Inc. were converted to a limited liability company LLC.
Restructuring Support Agreement and Term Sheet
On December 23, 2011, the Parent Company entered into a restructuring support agreement (the Restructuring Support Agreement) with, among others, (i) holders representing approximately 92% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes (the Consenting Noteholders) , (ii)  holders representing 100% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the First Lien Loans (the Consenting First Lien Lenders and together with the Consenting Noteholders, the Consenting Lenders), (iii) the Consenting Noteholders, as beneficial holders of 100% of the aggregate outstanding amount of the Second Lien Loans, (iv) Aquilex Holdco L.P. and (v) the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan in its capacity as holder of 98.5% of the equity interests in Aquilex Holdco L.P, the principal owner of the Parent Company.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Amounts in thousands of dollars, except unit amounts)
The parties to the Restructuring Support Agreement agreed to the principal terms of a financial restructuring (the Restructuring) of the debt of the Parent Company, through the simultaneous commencement of (i) an out-of-court offer (the Exchange Offer) to exchange the Senior Notes for Class A Units (Common Units) or for a cash amount described below and (ii) the solicitation of votes for a prepackaged plan of reorganization (the Prepackaged Plan) under the Bankruptcy Code Title 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code). In connection with the Restructuring, the Parent Company commenced a rights offering (the Rights Offering) with an aggregate offering amount of $80,000, pursuant to which certain holders of the Senior Notes were entitled to subscribe for their pro rata share of Class B Units (Preferred Units).
Pursuant to the terms of the Restructuring Support Agreement, each Consenting Lender agreed, among other things, subject to certain conditions, to vote to accept the Prepackaged Plan. In addition, each Consenting Noteholder agreed, among other things, to (a) tender and not withdraw its Senior Notes in the Exchange Offer, (b) consent to certain proposed amendments to the Indenture (the Proposed Amendments), and (c) provide the Backstop Commitment (as defined below).
As required, upon the close of the Restructuring on February 3, 2012:

Backstop Purchase Agreement
On December 23, 2011, the Parent Company entered into a Backstop Purchase Agreement (the Backstop Agreement) with the Consenting Noteholders, pursuant to which each Consenting Noteholder agreed, among other things, to purchase in the aggregate, at the Rights Offering purchase price, all of the Parent Company's Preferred Units that were not subscribed for prior to the closing of the Rights Offering (the Backstop Commitment) and to purchase additional Preferred Units at the Rights Offering purchase price in order to fund the sum of the cash amount that the Parent Company was required to pay to Noteholders that elected to exchange their Senior Notes in the Exchange Offer for cash and the cash amount that the Parent Company was required to pay to the Noteholders who tendered into the Exchange Offer (other than the Consenting Noteholders) as a consent fee. In exchange for providing the Backstop Commitment, the Consenting Noteholders received a backstop commitment fee, which was deemed earned upon receipt of a Debtor in Possession Commitment on December 23, 2011 from Royal Bank of Canada, in an amount equal to $3,632 (the Backstop Fee), which was paid in the form of a dollar for dollar increase in the principal amount of the Parent Company's Second Lien Loan which, in turn, converted into Preferred Units at the Rights Offering price. At December 31, 2011, the Backstop Fee is a deferred asset and is included in prepaid assets. Upon the close of the restructuring on February 3, 2012, the deferred asset was charged against the gross proceeds of the Rights Offering.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Parent Company Allocations
The accompanying financial statements include an allocation of the Parent Company's costs for shared services, support functions and certain entity wide benefits expenses that have been allocated to Aquilex SRO using methodologies primarily based on Aquilex SRO's revenues as a percentage of the total Parent Company's consolidated revenue, which is considered to be most meaningful in the circumstances. These allocated costs to Aquilex SRO are primarily related to the Parent Company's general and administrative expenses, reorganization costs, corporate employee costs, as well as costs for certain health and welfare benefits, incentive compensation plans, and other costs maintained at the Parent Company level for each of its subsidiaries. In addition, Aquilex SRO is allocated a portion of the Parent Company's costs for shared services for the following functional groups: information technology, legal services, accounting and finance services, human resources, marketing and product support, product development, treasury, travel group, and payroll services. Subsequent to the February 3, 2012 restructuring, the Parent Company continued allocation of such costs though the amounts declined from the prior periods. These allocated costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in the Aquilex SRO Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Loss. For the periods February 3, 2012 to December 31, 2012, January 1, 2012 to February 2, 2012 and for the year ended December 31, 2011, the Parent Company allocated SG&A costs to Aquilex SRO totaling $4,923, $4,276, and $19,086, respectively.
The accompanying financial statements also include related party debt, interest, and deferred financing costs allocated from the Parent Company as described in Note 5, Related Parties. The debt amounts allocated include gross proceeds from debt net of original issue discount ("OID") and principal repayments.
Management believes that the estimates, assumptions, and methodology underlying the allocation of these shared services, support functions, certain entity wide benefits expenses, related party debt, interest and deferred financing costs as reflected in the financial statements are reasonable, however, actual expenses and financing may have differed materially from these allocations had the Company operated independently of the Parent Company for the periods presented. The Company's financial statements do not purport to reflect what the results of operations, financial position or cash flows would have been had the Company operated as an independent company during the periods presented nor do they purport to indicate what the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position will be as of any future date or for any future period.

Central Treasury Operations
For each of the Parent Company's businesses, which were historically managed as a separate business, the Parent Company used a centralized approach to cash management and financing of its operations. Central treasury activities include the sweeping of cash balances daily from subsidiary accounts to a Parent Company master account, the investment of surplus cash, the issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt and interest rate management. All Parent Company funding to and from Aquilex SRO has been accounted for as a related party payable or receivable from the Parent Company. These Parent Company transfers to and from Aquilex SRO are presented as a Parent (Receivable) Payable within the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Member's Equity (Deficit). With the exception of the Aquilex Welding Services B.V. operations, the cash balance of Aquilex SRO is normally nominal.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and the differences could be material. On an ongoing basis, estimates are reviewed based on information that is currently available.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of all highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less. The Company's cash equivalents consist primarily of overnight commercial bank and money market deposits. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet approximate fair value.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable represent amounts currently due from customers, but not yet collected. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company's best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Company's existing accounts receivable. The allowance consists of specifically reserved against receivables with an additional reserve, based on historical write-off experience and current economic conditions. The Company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and are deemed by management probable of being uncollectible.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the average cost method. Costs included in inventories primarily consist of welding wire and related materials used in production or delivery of services.
Contract Related Assets and Liabilities
Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets represent unbilled amounts earned and reimbursable under contracts in progress. Such costs include all direct costs and overhead allocation. These amounts become billable according to the contract terms, which usually consider the passage of time, achievement of milestones or completion of the project.
Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets represent advanced billings to clients on contracts in advance of work performed.

(Amounts in thousands of dollars, except unit amounts)
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, and depreciation is computed using the straight-line method, net of estimated salvage values, over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset. Estimated useful lives are as follows:
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives of existing equipment are capitalized and depreciated. Upon retirement or disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the Company's accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value is defined under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820"), as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a three-level hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows:
Level 1-inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for an identical asset or liability in an active market.
Level 2-inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for a similar asset or liability in an active market or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
Level 3-inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability.
As of December 31, 2012, the Company had carrying values of $27,567 for accounts receivable, net, $4,233 for accounts payable, and $90,202 for related party debt. For these respective items, the carrying value approximated fair value at December 31, 2012.
During 2011, in accordance with ASC 350 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("ASC 350"), and ASC 360 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ("ASC 360"), goodwill and intangible assets were written down to $68,334 and $89,930, respectively, at December 31, 2011. The write down of the assets resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $71,622 and an intangible assets impairment charge of $35,502 in 2011. These are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The Company utilized Level 3 inputs, as defined in the fair value hierarchy, for the fair value measurement of these assets. These items are presented on the balance sheet as Goodwill and Other intangible assets, net. Changes in these respective items appear as Impairment charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Loss. There were no impairment charges in for the periods February 3, 2012 to December 31, 2012 or January 1, 2012 to February 2, 2012. See Note 7, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."

(Amounts in thousands of dollars, except unit amounts)
For the year ended December 31, 2012, there have been no transfers between hierarchy levels.
Deferred Financing Costs
Deferred financing costs are amortized over the life of the related debt using the effective interest method.
Goodwill and Nonamortizable Intangible Assets
ASC 350 provides that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but must be tested at least annually for impairment. ASC 350 also provides specific guidance for testing goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The first step in testing for goodwill impairment compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is then performed. The second step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill to the fair value of the goodwill. An impairment charge is recognized for any amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.
The Predecessor's annual goodwill impairment testing date was November 30 and the Successor's annual impairment testing date is December 31. A test for impairment will be performed between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Examples of such events or circumstances may include a significant change in business climate, loss of a significant customer or loss of key personnel. ASC 350 requires that we make certain estimates and assumptions in order to allocate goodwill to reporting units and to determine the fair value of reporting unit net assets and liabilities, including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, cost of capital and growth rates, which could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets.
The Company's profitability may suffer from downturns in customer demand and other factors. If material adverse conditions occur, our future estimates of fair value may not support the carrying amount of Aquilex SRO and goodwill would need to be written down to an amount considered recoverable.
The Company is required to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events and circumstances change that would indicate the asset might be impaired. The Predecessor's annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing date is November 30 and the Successor's annual impairment testing date is December 31. The Company performs the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the asset's fair value to its carrying value. An impairment charge is recognized if the asset's estimated fair value is less than its carrying value. The fair value of the Company's indefinite lived intangible assets is based on projected DCFs. The use of different estimates or assumptions within the Company's DCF model when determining the fair value, or using a methodology other than a DCF model, could result in different values and could result in an impairment charge. The most significant assumptions within the Company's discounted cash flow model are the discount and growth rates. The Company believes its estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value.
Management considers the trade names to have indefinite useful lives and, accordingly, are not subject to amortization. The Company reached this conclusion principally due to the longevity of the Aquilex SRO name and the associated subsidiary names, and because the Company considered renewal upon the legal limit of the trade names as perfunctory. The Company expects to maintain usage of the Aquilex SRO and the associated subsidiary trade names on existing services and introduce new products in the future that will also display the trade names. Consequently, the trade names qualify as an indefinite-lived asset in accordance with ASC 350.

(Amounts in thousands of dollars, except unit amounts)
Long-Lived Assets and Amortizable Intangible Assets
We review our long-lived assets, including our intangible assets with finite useful lives, for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable, as required by ASC 360. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or asset group are compared to the asset or asset groups' carrying amount to determine if an impairment of such asset is necessary. This requires us to make long-term forecasts of the future revenues and costs related to the assets or asset groups subject to review. Forecasts require assumptions about demand for our services and future conditions in the end markets we serve. Since estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized. Future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period. The effect of any impairment would be to expense the difference between fair value of such asset or asset group and its carrying value. Such expense would be reflected in operating expenses.
We estimate the useful life and fair value of purchased intangible assets at the time of acquisition and periodically review these estimates to determine whether these lives are appropriate. Our intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships and technology. Customer relationships, which include the fair value of acquired customer contracts, are evaluated using a DCF methodology.
If the estimate of an intangible asset's remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
 
Revenue Recognition
The Company evaluates the circumstances of each contract to determine the appropriate application of revenue recognition methods.
The Company's component construction services contracts that are short-term in nature are primarily accounted for by the completed contract method and these contracts set forth the scope of services and provide a detailed work plan and timetable. Revenue is recognized at the completion of the job, when accepted by the customer, title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and collectibility is reasonably assured.
Certain other Company contracts are accounted for by the percentage of completion method. This method is used where there are reliable estimates of revenue and cost, the contract specifies terms and conditions, and both the purchaser and the Company have the ability and expectation to perform all the contractual duties. In this regard, the Company uses two methods for determining the percent complete.
The output method involves the use of contract milestones which are specifically outlined in the contracts and reflect a reasonable estimate of progress on the project. Once the specific milestone is met, a percentage of revenue is recognized based on the cost incurred of the milestone and the estimated margin of the project. These milestones have clearly defined, recognized, and separable value and cost that reasonably reflect the progress of a long-cycle contract across multiple accounting periods. In some contracts, both specific billing and completion milestones are present. Sometimes, these are the same. However, the Company does have contracts where the billing milestone is set to have cash in advance of the revenue. In such circumstance, billing in excess of cost is recognized as a liability. In the event the project does not have definitive milestones, the input method of cost-to-total estimated costs is used to measure results directly and to measure progress toward completion. In these arrangements, a percentage of revenue is recognized based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs after giving effect to estimates of costs to complete based on most recent
14
Aquilex Specialty Repair & Overhaul LLC and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Amounts in thousands of dollars, except unit amounts)
information. We recognize revisions in profit estimates to income in the period in which the revision is determined. Estimated contract losses are recognized in full when determined.
The input method is used to determine the percent complete on time and materials contracts. Under the time and materials contracts, revenue is recognized based upon hours and cost to date at the estimated margin of the job. Due to the nature of these jobs, actual invoicing is completed after the revenue event occurs and therefore a cost in excess of billing is recorded at month end.
For the periods February 3, 2012 to December 31, 2012, January 1, 2012 to February 2, 2012 and the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company did not have any contracts for which a significant loss was anticipated.
These methods for determining the percent complete are applied consistently among all of the Company contracts having similar characteristics.
Insurance Reserves
The Company, through the Parent Company's group insurance policy, has a $500 per occurrence high deductible insurance program for most losses related to general liability, product liability, automobile liability, workers' compensation, and certain legal claims. For the policy period June 7, 2012 through June 6, 2013, the automobile deductible was $250 for Aquilex SRO. For the policy period June 7, 2011 through June 6, 2012, the automobile liability deductible was $500 for Aquilex SRO. The Company's self-insurance reserves for claims filed and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date are based upon management's assumptions and estimates regarding the probable outcome of the claims, historical payment trends, estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using loss development factors, and actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry. From time to time the Company obtains an actuarial estimate of its workers' compensation liability. Should the outcome differ from management's assumptions and estimates or should the insurance carriers become insolvent and unable to cover claims in excess of the Company's deductible, revisions to the estimated reserves for property and casualty and workers' compensation insurance would be required.
 
The expected ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date is not discounted and is recognized as a liability. For the policy period ended June 30, 2012, the Parent Company's group policy has a stop loss amount for our worker's compensation, general liability, and auto insurance programs that limits our exposure to an aggregate deductible payout in a policy year. For the policy period ending June 6, 2013, the Company does not have a stop loss provision. The limit for the policy period June 7, 2011 to June 6, 2012 was $7,280.
The Company has a $300 per covered person high deductible insurance policy for medical and dental coverage.
Losses up to the deductible amount for our different insurance policies are accrued based upon the Company's estimates of the ultimate liability for claims incurred. The accruals are based on all available information at the time the financial statements are prepared.
Foreign Currency Translation and Transaction Gains/ (Losses)
Assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, whose functional currency is the local currency, are translated at period-end exchange rates. Income and expense items are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the period. The adjustments resulting from translating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), a component of Member's Equity (Deficit). Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are reported in results of operations. Translation adjustments included in Other Comprehensive Loss for the periods February 3, 2012 to December 31, 2012, January 1, 2012 to February 2, 2012 and the year ended December 31, 2011 were $60, $27, and ($19), respectively. Net gains and losses from foreign currency transactions included in earnings for the periods February 3, 2012 to December 31, 2012, January 1, 2012 to February 2, 2012 and the year ended December 31, 2011 were $157, $4 and $61, respectively and are included in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Loss.

Employee Benefit Plans
Pension Benefits
The Company is subject to collective bargaining agreements with various unions and makes contributions to various multi-employer defined benefit pension plans administered by said unions under Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"). The plans are accounted for under the provisions of ASC 715 Compensation and Retirement. The Company's participation in the plans is accounted for as a participant in a multiemployer pension plan, and as such, the Company records pension expense as it is incurred.
401(k) Plan
The Parent Company maintains a 401(k) plan which eligible Company employees may elect to contribute from 0% to 75% of their pre-tax compensation subject to an annual maximum dollar amount as set by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company may make discretionary matching cash contributions.
Stock Based Compensation
Parent Company Management and Director Equity Incentive Plan, Successor
As an incentive to perform services for the Company, a management equity incentive plan was created by the Parent Company subsequent to the Parent Company restructuring that occurred on February 3, 2012. Certain members of management were granted incentive equity units in the Parent Company, which upon vesting can be converted into Class A units (common shares). The incentive equity units are separated into three tranches described as follows:
 
Income Taxes
For the period February 3, 2012 through December 31, 2012, the Company was a Single Member Limited Liability Company treated as an entity that is disregarded from its owner for Federal and State income tax purposes. As a result, the Company's income is allocated to the investors in its Parent Company and taxed at that level. As required by the Successor Limited Liability Company Agreement, the Company is required to make capital distributions to the investors equal to their tax liability attributable to the Company's earnings. If required, these distributions are reflected as capital distributions in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Member's Equity (Deficit). No tax distribution is required by the company for the year ended December 31, 2012. Entities owned by the Company pay income tax in certain state and foreign jurisdictions, and a U.S. subsidiary of the company is still liable for Federal and state income tax.

For the Predecessor, for the periods ended December 31, 2011 and February 2, 2012, the Company consisted of a group of U.S. corporations filing as members of a U.S. consolidated group, certain foreign entities, and one U.S. Corporation that filed a separate Federal and state income tax return.
The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Under this method, the deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such asset will be realized.
The Company regularly evaluates valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain. The estimation of required valuation allowances includes an estimate of future taxable income, reversals of deferred tax liabilities, carry back periods, and tax planning strategies.
For the Successor, deferred taxes are applicable to the foreign corporate entities and the one U.S. corporate entity.
In accordance with ASC 740-10, the Company records reserves and interest for the uncertain outcome of certain tax positions and elected to include any future penalties and interest related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.
For the period ended December 31, 2012 the unrecognized tax benefits did not change. For the year ended December 31, 2011 the unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $2,177 for statue expirations and increased by $735 for certain tax positions taken.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist of accounts receivable and cash deposits. Through the central treasury operations, the Parent Company maintains cash balances at financial institutions which may at times be in excess of federally insured levels. The Company has not incurred to date nor does it expect to incur any losses related to the cash deposits.
The Company grants credit, generally without collateral, to its customers, which include electric power, oil and gas, and petrochemical companies located primarily in the United States, Europe, Canada, South America, and India. Consequently, the Company is subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors throughout such countries. However, the Company generally is entitled to payment for work performed and has certain lien rights on that work.
Management believes the Company's credit risk in its portfolio of accounts receivable is adequately reserved. Receivables with any one particular customer could be material at a point in time and if a bankruptcy occurred with one of these customers, the loss could be material. Management believes timely collection of trade receivables minimizes associated credit risk. On a periodic basis, management evaluates the creditworthiness of the Company's customers and monitors accounts receivable, but typically does not require collateral.
For the periods February 3, 2012 to December 31, 2012, January 1, 2012 to February 2, 2012 and the year ended December 31, 2011, the largest customer represented 7.9%, 24.6% and 6.3% of revenue, respectively.

New Accounting Pronouncements
ASU 2012-02, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment
In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment." This revised standard provides entities with the option to first use an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If a conclusion is reached that the indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value is not more likely than not below carrying value, no further impairment testing is necessary. The Company will adopt this standard for its consolidated financial statements for 2013.
    
ASU 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. Under this standard, an entity is required to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of Accumulated OCI by component. In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of Accumulated OCI by the respective line items of net income, but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting period. For amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts. This standard does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2012. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
ASU 2011-09, Compensation - Retirement Benefits, Multiemployer (Topic 715), Disclosures about an Employer's Participation in a Multiemployer Plan
In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-09, which amends ASC 715-802 by increasing the quantitative and qualitative disclosures an employer is required to provide about its participation in significant multiemployer plans that offer pension and other postretirement benefits. The ASU's objective is to enhance the transparency of disclosures
about (1) the significant multiemployer plans in which an employer participates, (2) the level of the employer's participation in those plans, (3) the financial health of the plans, and (4) the nature of the employer's commitments to the plans. The disclosure requirements do not apply to an employer's participation in multiple-employer plans
(i.e., single-employer plans aggregated to pool plan assets for investment purposes or to reduce the costs of plan administration). For nonpublic entities, the new disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2012. The amendments in the ASU should be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. The standard will require increased disclosures for the Company. The Company adopted this standard for its consolidated financial statements for 2012.
ASU 2011-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), Testing Goodwill for Impairment
In September 2011, the FASB issued amendments allowing the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after considering the totality of events and circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The amendment is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt this standard for its consolidated financial statements for 2013

On February 3, 2012, the Parent Company became majority owned by affiliates of Centerbridge Partners, L.P. The total adjusted acquisition price as of the closing date was $187,238. The acquisition was financed through a debt for equity conversion with a fair value of $107,238 and approximately $80,000 in equity contributions. The accompanying financial statements include $134,811 of the consideration received by the Parent Company, which was allocated to Aquilex SRO based on its relative fair value compared to the total Parent Company.
The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, (ASC 805). Accordingly, the Company allocated the purchase price based upon the fair values of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
The following table summarizes the final allocation of the fair value consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed:
The Company separately identified customer relationships, trade names, and technology as the acquired identifiable intangible assets. Trade names have been assigned an indefinite life and, therefore, will not be amortized, but tested at least annually for impairment. Customer relationships have a weighted average amortization period of 20 years and Technology has a weighted average amortization period of 10 years. As of the date of acquisition, these assets were valued as follows:

Parent Company Debt and Interest Expenses Allocation
The Parent Company debt (Parent Company Debt) consists of debt and interest expense allocations as of December 31, 2011 and for the periods January 1, 2012 to February 2, 2012 and the year ended December 31, 2011 to Aquilex SRO from Aquilex Holdings LLC (Predecessor Debt), and consists of the debt and interest expense allocations as of December 31, 2012 and for the period February 3, 2012 to December 31, 2012 to Aquilex SRO from Aquilex LLC (Successor Debt). Aquilex LLC, Aquilex SRO, as well as substantially all other U.S. based subsidiaries of the Parent Company (jointly Aquilex Parties), are borrowers under the Parent Company Debt.
All Parent Company Debt and related interest expense is allocated to the Parent Company's US based subsidiaries on a relative fair value basis. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, this debt was categorized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as related party debt payable of $90,202 and $286,707, respectively. Aquilex SRO is also allocated interest expense on a quarterly basis. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had a related party interest payable of $29 and $30,579, respectively, which is included in Parent (Receivable) Payable, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Parent Company debt is described further in Note 9, Parent Company Debt.
The intercompany debt agreement maintains that repayment of the allocated Aquilex SRO long-term Parent Company Debt and accrued related party interest is at the discretion of the Parent Company and no specified terms are provided. The terms in Note 9, Parent Company Debt, refer to the actual terms of the Parent Company Debt with the respective lenders. Substantially all of the assets of Aquilex Holdings LLC, Aquilex Intermediate Holdings LLC, Aquilex LLC, and its U.S. based subsidiaries, including Aquilex SRO; serve as collateral for the Parent Company Debt.

Member's Capital
Upon the close of the Restructuring on February 3, 2012, the Predecessor's equity structure, including the Member's Capital, was eliminated when the debt-for-equity exchange occurred. The Member's Capital in the Successor period represents the Parent Company's interest in the recorded net assets of the Company. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, 100 member units were outstanding.
Parent Company Employee Retention Plan
On October 13, 2011, the Parent Company adopted an employee retention plan (the Employee Retention Plan) in contemplation of the restructuring that was completed on February 3, 2012. The plan covers certain of the Parent Company's managers and executives (the Covered Employees). Under the Employee Retention Plan, each Covered Employee received a bonus payment, one-half of which was paid upon the Covered Employee's entry into an agreement confirming acceptance of the terms of the Employee Retention Plan. The remaining one-half of the bonus payment was paid to the Covered Employee approximately ninety days following the consummation of the change of control of the Parent Company on February 3, 2012. The Employee Retention Plan was no longer in effect at December 31, 2012.
Aquilex SRO recorded $383, $279, and $1,210 in SG&A costs in the periods February 3, 2012 to December 31, 2012, January 1, 2012 to February 2, 2012 and for the year ended December 31, 2011 which represents an allocation of the total Employee Retention Plan costs of the Parent Company based on Aquilex SRO's revenue as a percentage of the total Parent Company consolidated revenue. The Company believes that such allocation methodology is reasonable. These retention plan costs are recorded as part of the total restructuring costs.The expense allocated to Aquilex SRO for the Employee Retention Plan are not necessarily indicative of the expense that would have been incurred if Aquilex SRO had been a separate, independent entity and had otherwise a specific Employee Retention Plan at the Aquilex SRO level.
 
Property and equipment consist of the following:
Depreciation expense for periods February 3, 2012 to December 31, 2012, January 1, 2012 to February 2, 2012 and for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $10,335, $614, and $7,563, respectively.
 
During the third quarter 2011, the Predecessor experienced significant adverse changes in operating results, including changes to future forecasted results, cash flow, and covenant compliance. These factors were considered in the aggregate and deemed to be a triggering event for purposes of performing an impairment test in the third quarter of 2011 under ASC 350 and ASC 360. Accordingly, as of August 31, 2011, the Company performed an impairment review of long-lived assets which indicated a recoverable carrying value for property and equipment. Therefore, the Predecessor did not record
21
Aquilex Specialty Repair & Overhaul LLC and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Amounts in thousands of dollars, except unit amounts)
an impairment of property and equipment. However, the Predecessor did record impairments of the intangible assets as detailed in Note 7 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets below.
During the third quarter of 2011, the Company experienced significant adverse changes as described in Note 6 above. As of August 31, 2011, the Company performed an impairment review of goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization. In conjunction with this evaluation, the Company updated its forecasted cash flows and underlying assumptions to reflect the current size and related demand requirements of the industries the Company serves after the impacts of the recent recession. As a result, the Company determined that its goodwill was impaired. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $71,622 in the third quarter of 2011. The remaining carrying value of goodwill at December 31, 2011 totaled $68,334.
Subsequently, as of November 30, 2011, the date of the annual impairment review, the Company determined that there were no further impairments for either goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset. Hypothetical increases or decreases in the long-term growth factors and discount rates for the November 30, 2011 annual impairment test date would be comparable to the August 31, 2011 hypothetical results.
Impairments of the indefinite-lived intangible assets are recognized when our estimate of discounted cash flows over the assets' remaining useful lives are less than the carrying value of the assets. The fair values of the Company's trade names are measured using the relief-from-royalty method. This method is used to estimate the cost savings that accrue to the owner of an intangible asset who would otherwise have to pay royalties or license fees on revenues earned through the use of the asset. The market-derived royalty rate is applied to estimate the royalty savings. The net after-tax royalty savings are discounted to determine the fair value. Any excess carrying value over the fair value represents the amount of impairment. In conjunction with the ASC 350 impairment test in the third quarter of 2011, the Company also recorded an impairment charge of $3,700 for the Company's trade names.
As a result of the triggering events described above in the Company's goodwill impairment analysis, the Company reviewed its definite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 360 for recoverability. As a result of this analysis, the Company recognized a definite lived intangible asset impairment charge for customer relationships in the amount of $31,802 in the third quarter 2011. The inputs measured at fair value used in this valuation methodology were considered Level 3 in the three-tier value hierarchy per ASC 820.
The changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill for the period ended December 31, 2012 and the year ended December 31, 2011 are as follows:

(Amounts in thousands of dollars, except unit amounts)
The changes in the carrying amounts of other intangible assets for the period ended December 31, 2012 and the year ended December 31, 2011 are as follows:
In conjunction with the Restructuring that was completed on February 3, 2012, an allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was performed. Under the provisions of ASC 805, the fair value of the intangible assets acquired was recorded on February 3, 2012 and amortized accordingly. For the period February 3, 2012 to December 31 2012, no intangible assets were impaired
The adjustment to the gross carrying amount for the customer relationships intangible assets in the year ended December 31, 2011 reflects both the impairment charge writedown of the gross carrying value and the write-off of the accumulated amortization as of August 31, 2011, the impairment test date resulting from changes in the forecasted results, cash flow and covenant compliance. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the accumulated amortization written off as part of the impairment charge was $6,211 for Aquilex SRO customer relationships.
Definite lived intangible assets are amortized over the period the economic use is consumed. Amortization expense for periods February 3, 2012 to December 31, 2012, January 1, 2012 to February 2, 2012 and for the year ended 2011, was $4,196, $538 and $8,164, respectively.
As of December 31, 2012, future amortization is as follows:

Subject to various exceptions and baskets set forth in the First Lien Revolving Loan Facility and Second Lien Term Loan Agreement, the Parent Company and its subsidiaries (other than any unrestricted subsidiaries) are restricted from taking certain actions, including: (i) incurring additional indebtedness; (ii) creating liens on assets; (iii) making investments, loans or advances in or to other persons; (iv) paying dividends or distributions on, or repurchasing stock or other equity interests; (v) repaying, redeeming or repurchasing certain indebtedness; (vi) changing the nature of the Parent Company's business; (vii) engaging in transactions with affiliates; (viii) undergoing fundamental changes (including mergers); and (ix) making dispositions of assets. The First Lien Revolving Loan Facility and Second Lien Term Loan Agreement also contains cross default covenants tied to all other indebtedness of the Parent Company. Substantially all of the assets of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries serve as collateral for First Lien Revolving Loan Facility and Second Lien Term Loan Agreement.
The Parent Company was in compliance with all financial maintenance covenants at December 31, 2012 associated with the First Lien Revolving Loan Facility and Second Lien Term Loan Agreement.
On February 28, 2011, the Parent Company entered into Amendment No. 1 (the Amendment No. 1) to its First Lien Credit Agreement, dated as of April 1, 2010 and modified on June 17, 2010, with the Royal Bank of Canada, as administrative agent and L/C (Letter of Credit) Issuer, and the required lenders there under.
The parent company was not in compliance with its financial maintenance covenants under the First Lien Credit Agreement at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2011. In addition, Aquilex Holdings LLC did not make the scheduled interest payment due on December 15, 2011 of $12,516 on the Senior Notes. Forbearance Agreements were obtained for the financial covenant defaults.
 
Also, a Notes Forbearance Agreement was obtained from the holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes in conjunction with the failure to make the Senior Notes interest payment on December 15, 2011.
During the period February 3, 2012 to December 31, 2012 there were 38,300 Parent Company incentive equity units awarded to SRO employees and 450 incentive equity units were forfeited. At December 31, 2012 there were 95,172 incentive equity units outstanding and 28,424 incentive equity units available for future awards. Aquilex SRO recorded $273 in SG&A costs related to the vesting of the Tranche I incentive equity units for the period February 3, 2012 to December 31, 2012 which represents the portion of the compensation expense recorded by the Parent Company related to SRO employees and an allocation of the compensation expense related to corporate employees and directors based on Aquilex SRO's revenue as a percentage of the total Parent Company consolidated revenue. The Company believes that such allocation methodology is reasonable. The expense allocated to Aquilex SRO for the Parent Company Management Equity Incentive Plan is not necessarily indicative of the expense that would have been incurred if Aquilex SRO had been a separate, independent entity and had otherwise a specific Parent Company Management Equity Incentive Plan at the Aquilex SRO level. No compensation expense has been recorded on Tranche II and Tranche III as no performance hurdles were met during 2012. Unrecognized compensation cost related to incentive equity units for the Parent Company of $2,948 is to be recognized over a weighted average period of 5 years. There was no cash impact for the incentive equity units in 2012.
The Parent Company estimates the fair value of management equity awards using the Black-Scholes valuation model. For the units issued in 2012, the February 3, 2012 acquisition price of $187,238 was used in the option pricing model to establish the fair value of the equity awards. Key input assumptions under the Black-Scholes pricing model for the 2012 Successor period units were as follows:

The expected life of units represents the weighted average period of time that the equity awards are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and an analysis of holding periods for previously realized investments and current owned investments. The risk-free interest rate is based on pricing and yields on U.S. Treasury Strip securities for the expected term. Expected volatility is based on an analysis of the weekly and monthly historical, and the observed implied, volatility of a set of guideline companies.
 
The Company leases certain buildings and equipment under noncancelable operating lease agreements. As of December 31, 2012, future minimum payments under these leases are as follows:
Rent expense for the periods February 3, 2012 to December 31, 2012, January 1, 2012 to February 2, 2012 and for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $1,832, $169, and $2,224 respectively.

The Company is covered under a broad range of insurance coverage through the Parent Company group policy that is provided by insurance companies, including worker's compensation, business auto liability, general liability, commercial property, political risk and an umbrella policy. The respective reserves are based on management's assumptions and estimates regarding the probable outcome of the claims. The Company has not incurred significant claims or losses on any of these insurance policies. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, $300 and $1,228, respectively, were included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets for self-insurance claims.
Litigation
The Company is a defendant in various lawsuits arising in the normal course of the Company's business. Substantially all of these suits are being defended by the Company, their insurance carriers or other parties pursuant to indemnification obligations. The Company believes a majority of the claims covered by insurance will be resolved at or for less than the applicable deductibles and that any liability in excess of a deductible will not exceed the limits of the applicable insurance policies. Although the results of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes adequate provisions have been made for outstanding claims and the final outcome of any pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Teck Cominco Metals Ltd. v. WSI, et al.
The Company is named as a defendant in this suit filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Canada, in which the plaintiff alleges that a boiler explosion it experienced in 2004 was the result of a water leak caused by allegedly negligent repair work performed by WSI in 2002. The plaintiff alternatively alleges that

WSI negligently failed to alert it to the hazardous condition of the boiler. The plaintiff claims damages of approximately $28,000. WSI's insurer has been notified about this litigation and is funding the defense costs. Discovery in this matter commenced in April 2008 and is ongoing. The Company obtained evidence that the leak in question may have been caused by a third party, and joined such third party as well as other potentially responsible parties as defendants in this litigation. The Company has also filed a counterclaim against the plaintiff alleging breach of contract. The Company intends to vigorously defend this matter and does not believe a loss is either probable or reasonably estimable.
Performance Bonds
During the ordinary course of business, the Company is periodically required to enter into performance bond arrangements to collateralize its obligations under various contracts. The Company has a total of $2,620 and $3,016 in performance bond obligations as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Aquilex WSI, B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, has entered into bank guarantees to collateralize its obligations under various contracts. The Company has a total of $2,047 and $1,932 in bank guarantees as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Income tax provision (benefit) from continuing operations consists of the following components:
The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 is 13.16%. The difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory rate for 2011 of 35% is primarily due to permanent differences (such as non-deductible meals), the release of an uncertain tax position, due to the expiration of certain statute of limitations, a change in valuation allowance, and the write down of goodwill that is nondeductible for income tax purposes.
The effective tax rate for the period January 1, 2012 through February 2, 2012 is (13.83%). The difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory rate during this period of 35% is primarily due to permanent differences (such as non-deductible meals) and a change in valuation allowance.
For the period February 3, 2012 through December 31, 2012, the Company was a Single Member Limited Liability Company treated as an entity that is disregarded from its owner for Federal and state income tax purposes. As a result, the Company's income is allocated to the investors in Aquilex Holdings LLC and taxed at that level. Entities owned by the Company pay income tax in certain state and foreign jurisdictions, and a U.S. subsidiary of the Company is still liable for Federal and state income tax. As a result of the Company being a Limited Liability Company, the effective tax rate does not provide a meaningful measure of the taxes ultimately paid on the Company's earnings and therefore is not analyzed by the Company.

At December 31, 2011, the deferred tax assets consisted primarily of net operating loss carryforwards, tax deductible goodwill and other intangibles, property and equipment, accrued liabilities and certain transaction costs. Realization of the deferred tax assets related to the state NOL carryforwards is dependent upon the Company generating sufficient taxable income in future periods in certain jurisdictions.
As of December 31, 2011, the Company has a valuation allowance of $22,325. As of December 31, 2011, the Company has a net deferred tax liability of $5,271. During 2011, because of the impairment charge, the Company changed from a net deferred tax liability position to a net deferred tax asset position, prior to consideration of the valuation allowance. The Company determined that it did not meet the more likely than not standard that substantially all of its net U.S. deferred tax assets would be realized and therefore, the Company established a valuation allowance for its net U.S. deferred tax assets. The net deferred tax liability of $5,271 as of December 31, 2011 relates primarily to a deferred tax liability for certain trade names owned by the Company. As the trade names are considered to be assets with an indefinite life, the future taxable temporary difference associated with the asset is not available as a source of future taxable income to support the realization of deferred tax assets created by other deductible temporary differences. The Company does not believe it is more likely than not it will realize its U.S. deferred tax assets equal to the deferred tax liability associated with these trade names and therefore, the Company was required to record an additional income tax expense to increase its deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
As of December 31, 2012, the Company's deferred tax asset relates primarily to differences between the financial statement basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities of foreign entities.
At December 31, 2011, the Company has approximately $59,659 of Federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards that begin to expire in 2027. At December 31, 2011, the Company has approximately $86,438 of state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards expiring in the years 2012 through 2031. Additionally, the Company has Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) credit carryforwards of approximately $243 and foreign tax credit carryforwards of $1,485 as of December 31, 2011. The AMT credit carryforwards have an indefinite life. The foreign tax credits begin to expire in 2018. All NOLs, AMT and foreign tax credits existing as of December 15, 2008 acquisition date are subject to the limitations of Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Sections 382 and 383, respectively. Additionally, the utilization of the NOLs may be subject to the separate return year limitations under Treasury Regulation 1.1502-21.
As of December 31, 2012, due to the conversion of various entities owned by the Company to Single Member Limited Liability Companies, such entities have no Federal income tax attributes or carryforwards.
The Company has not provided U.S. income taxes for undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be retained indefinitely for reinvestment.
As a result of the prior adoption of ASC 740-10, the Company has reserves for the uncertain outcome of certain tax positions. As of December 31, 2012, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $1,604. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the Company recorded income tax expense/ (benefit) of $132 and ($1,248), respectively, for interest and penalties. The cumulative amount of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 were $236 and $104. The Company expects the unrecognized tax benefit to decrease by approximately $943 over the next 12 months due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitation.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2012 and 2011:
The Company's tax returns are subject to periodic audit by the various jurisdictions in which it operates. These audits can result in adjustments of taxes due or adjustments of the net operating losses, which are available to offset future taxable income. As of December 31, 2012, the federal statute of limitation has years 2009 through 2012 open for examination. Due to certain net operating loss carrybacks, the statute of limitations for 2005 and 2006 are open with regard to the following amounts that have been refunded until 2013: 2005, $797 and 2006, $72. Statutes of limitation vary from state to state but are generally open either 3 or 4 years.
The Company contributes to a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover certain union-represented employees. Currently, the Company has no intention to withdraw from these plans. The risks of participating in a multiemployer plan are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects:
a. Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.
b. If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.
c. If a participating employer chooses to stop participating in a multiemployer plan, the employer may be required to pay the plan an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities upon employers who are contributors to a multiemployer plan in the event of the employer's withdrawal from, or upon termination of, such plan. The plans do not maintain information on the net
assets and actuarial present value of the plans' unfunded vested benefits allocable to the Company. As such, the amount, if any, for which the Company may be contingently liable, is not ascertainable at this time.
The majority of the Company's unionized employees work in the building and construction industry (B&C), and therefore, the Company believes it satisfies the criteria for the B&C industry exception under ERISA for those multiemployer pension plans that primarily cover employees in the B&C industry. As a result, the Company does not expect to be assessed a withdrawal liability when it ceases making contributions to those plans after the completion of a project or projects, so long as it does not continue to perform work in the jurisdiction of the pension plan on a non-union basis. The applicability of the B&C industry proviso is fact specific, so there can be no assurance in any particular situation whether the B&C proviso applies or whether withdrawal liability will be assessed.

The Pension Protection Act of 2006 added new funding rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after 2007 for multiemployer plans that are classified as endangered, seriously endangered, or critical status. For a plan in endangered, seriously endangered or critical status, additional required contributions and benefit reductions may apply. A number of plans to which the Company's business units contribute or may contribute in the future are in "endangered" or critical status. Certain of these plans may require additional contributions, generally in the form of a surcharge on future benefit contributions required for future work performed by union employees covered by these plans. The amount of additional funds, if any, that the Company may be obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be estimated, as such amounts will likely be based on future levels of work that require the specific use of those union employees covered by these plans.
The following table contains a summary of plan information relating to the Company's participation in the multiemployer pension plans, including Company contributions for the last two years, status of the multiemployer plan, and whether the plan is subject to a funding improvement, rehabilitation plan or contribution surcharges. Information has been presented separately for individually significant plans (defined as plans that make up 70 to 80 percent of the total Company defined benefit contributions and any plan that exceeds individual contributions of $40 in any plan year presented).
(1) The zone status is based on information that Company received from the plan as well as publicly available information per the Department of Labor website and is certified by the plan's actuary. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65 percent funded, plans in the yellow zone are less than 80 percent funded, and plans in the green zone are at least 80 percent funded.
(2) The Subject to Financial Improvement / Rehabilitation Plan column indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan (FIP) or a rehabilitation plan (RP) is either pending or has been implemented.
(3) The last column lists the expiration date(s) of the collective-bargaining agreement(s) to which the plans are subject. Collective Bargaining Agreements renew automatically each year on July 16 unless written notice is provided by the Company or the respective union at least 60 days in advance.
Based upon the most recent and available plan financial information, the Company did not make any contributions that represented more than 5 percent of total plan contributions in any of the plan years presented above.
Defined Contribution Plan
The Company provides retirement benefits to substantially all US-based employees primarily through the Parent Company's 401(k) plan into which eligible employees may elect to contribute from 0% to 75% of their pre-tax compensation subject to an annual maximum dollar amount as set by the Internal Revenue Service. At its discretion, the Parent Company may make discretionary matching cash contributions. Employer 401(k) matching contributions to the plan for the periods February 3, 2012 to December 31, 2012, January 1, 2012 to February 2, 2012 and for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $274, $0 and $667, respectively.

The Company performed an evaluation of subsequent events through March 28, 2013 the date the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued, and determined there were no recognized or unrecognized subsequent events, other than the item discussed below, that would require an adjustment or additional disclosure in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2012.
On February 25, 2013, the Parent Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement to sell Aquilex SRO to AZZ, Incorporated. The Securities Purchase Agreement provides for the acquisition by AZZ, Incorporated. of all of the equity interests of Aquilex SRO for cash consideration in the amount of $250 million. The $250 million will be adjusted for changes in working capital at the time of closing.
