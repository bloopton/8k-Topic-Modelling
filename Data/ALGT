Las Vegas, Nev., Jan. 30 /PRNewswire/  Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ: ALGT), parent company of Allegiant Air and Allegiant Vacations, today reported the following fourth quarter and full year 2006 results, and comparisons to prior year equivalents:
"Our excellent fourth quarter operating results added to our already strong performance through September 2006," said Maurice J. Gallagher, Chairman, CEO and President of Allegiant Travel Company. "Through our continued focus on being different' our team members have produced results of which we all can be proud. Customer response to our leisure service offerings continues to be encouraging, including to our new world-class leisure destination' of Tampa Bay/St. Petersburg."
Gallagher continued, "We are very pleased with our 11.7% operating margin in the fourth quarter. Our December initial public offering substantially improved our balance sheet, making it one of the best in the industry. In particular, 2006 year-end cash and short-term investments were a substantial $136 million. We believe we have built a strong base from which to face the future."
Linda Marvin, Allegiant CFO, commented, "Net income in our fourth quarter and full year 2006 was impacted by a one-time $6.4 million charge to recognize deferred tax liabilities due to the tax reorganization carried out in conjunction with our initial public offering. Further clarification of this point can be found on page 38 of our final prospectus dated December 7, 2006."
Significant Company events in the fourth quarter of 2006 included:
The current status of Allegiant Air's fuel hedging program is summarized below:
 -  includes approximately $0.24 per gallon in expenses above the raw cost of jet fuel
We may yet enter into further fuel hedge transactions for March 2007 fuel consumption.

 -  includes cities served seasonally
 -  includes purchases expected to close by January 31, 2007 of two previously-leased aircraft

Exhibit 99.1
Allegiant Travel Company Reports First Quarter 2007 Financial Results
Las Vegas, Nev., May 1 /PRNewswire/  Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ: ALGT), parent company of Allegiant Air and Allegiant Vacations, today reported the following first quarter 2007 results, and comparisons to prior year equivalents:
 
*Total system includes scheduled service, fixed fee contract and non-revenue flying.
"We are pleased to kick off 2007 with a strong set of first quarter results," said Maurice J. Gallagher, Chairman, CEO and President of Allegiant Travel Company. "Demand for our unique leisure product continues to be impressive. Despite a 49% increase in departures and a 28% ASM growth, load factor was up year-over-year. Further, total scheduled fare per passenger (including ancillary) was down only 1% despite a nearly 14% decrease in scheduled stage length. Our strong results  a 93% increase in our operating margin  are once again a tribute to our dedicated team-members. On the cost side, significantly shorter system stage length (down 11%) and exceptionally low prior-year maintenance costs contributed to a 10% year-over-year increase in non-fuel CASM."
Gallagher continued, "Our 17% first quarter operating margin was excellent even for what is historically our best quarter of the year. Both Las Vegas and Orlando were significantly stronger year-over-year, but the improvement in Orlando was striking, with Orlando's operating margin noticeably outpacing Las Vegas. Our new world class destination' of Tampa Bay/St. Petersburg was also strongly profitable. Looking at the second quarter, revenue strength is very encouraging to date. Last but not least, we continued to build our balance sheet, which maintained its status as one of the best in the industry. March 31, 2007 cash and short-term investments were a substantial $175 million."
Linda Marvin, Allegiant Travel Company CFO, stated, "Due to a non-recurring tax provision adjustment, our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 40.2%, significantly above our fourth quarter tax provision rate of 35.6%. The first quarter income tax provision reflects a one percentage point increase in federal income tax rate due to
1
 
increased profitability as well as an increase in the state portion of our tax provision based upon changes in the geographic mix of our flying. The higher tax rate applies to first quarter earnings as well as our previously existing deferred tax balances resulting in a non-recurring income tax adjustment of $0.4 million or $0.02 per share. Excluding the non-recurring income tax adjustment, our tax provision rate for the first quarter was 37.9% which we expect to be the approximate rate for the balance of 2007."
During the first quarter, Allegiant Air initiated service to three new small cities and on nine new routes. Allegiant Air also purchased, for cash, two MD-80 aircraft that were previously leased.
The current status of Allegiant Air's fuel hedging program is summarized below:
 
* includes approximately $0.24 per gallon in expenses above the raw cost of jet fuel
We may yet enter into further fuel hedge transactions for June 2007 fuel consumption.
The following tables summarize year-over-year and recent changes in Allegiant Air's scheduled network and fleet:
 
* includes cities served seasonally
 
 
We expect to place one additional owned, unencumbered MD-87 into service around June 1, increasing our operating fleet to 27 aircraft. We have also signed two letters of intent for a total of three aircraft (of which two would be operating-leased with a purchase option and one would be purchased for cash) for delivery this summer to support planned fourth quarter growth. This would increase our operating fleet to 30 aircraft before year end, consistent with our prior guidance of at least 29.
2
 
Announced future service includes ten new routes and six new small cities to be initiated by the end of the second quarter of 2007. We expect to make further new city and route announcements in the near future.
At this time, Allegiant Travel Company provides the following guidance to investors:
We expect second quarter Allegiant Air year-over-year ASM growth of 25-27% and departure growth of 39-41%. We expect full-year ASM growth of at least 27% and departure growth of at least 37%.
                 
By the end of the year, Allegiant Air expects to operate at least 30 MD-80 aircraft. There currently appear to be sufficient high-quality MD-80 aircraft available on the market to support Allegiant Air growth.

Allegiant Travel Company will host a conference call with analysts at 1 pm EDT tomorrow, May 2, 2007, to discuss our first quarter financial results. A live broadcast of the conference call will be available via the Company's Investor Relations website homepage at

The Company does not qualify for fuel hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133. Management regards the adjusted net income measure shown above as representative of the net income the Company would have shown if it did qualify for fuel hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 1, 2007, a subsidiary of Allegiant Travel Company (the "Company") entered into a lease for approximately 58,000 square feet of office space in a building to be constructed in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Company will combine all of its Las Vegas off-airport operations into this office and the landlord has agreed to assume the balance of the Companys two existing leases in Las Vegas. The Company expects to be able to occupy the new office as early as March 2008. The lease has a ten-year term with two five-year renewal options, but the Company has the right to terminate the lease after seven years and the right to purchase the building from the landlord after the third year of the lease. The initial base rental is approximately $1.3 million per year and is subject to escalation. The Company is also responsible for its share of common area maintenance charges. The landlord is a partnership in which certain of the Companys officers and directors (Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., Timothy P. Flynn and M. Ponder Harrison) own significant interests as limited partners. The disinterested members of the Companys Board of Directors and Audit Committee determined that the terms of the lease are at least as favorable as the Company could receive in an arms length transaction.

Exhibit 99.1
Allegiant Travel Company Reports Second Quarter 2007 Financial Results
Las Vegas, Nev., August 6 /PRNewswire/  Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ: ALGT), parent company of Allegiant Air and Allegiant Vacations, today reported the following second quarter 2007 results, and comparisons to prior year equivalents:
 
*Total system includes scheduled service, fixed fee contract and non-revenue flying.
"Our results in the second quarter continue to be in line with our expectations," said Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., Chairman, CEO and President of Allegiant Travel Company. "Year-over-year scheduled service passengers increased 58%, while scheduled service departures and ASMs were up 53% and 37%, respectively. Our superb team members delivered an operating margin almost on par with that of the first quarter despite significantly higher fuel prices in the second quarter. Further, our average scheduled fare per passenger at $108 was virtually the same as last year despite a nearly 11% decrease in scheduled stage length. This was driven primarily by our ancillary revenue component, which increased by over $6, year-over-year, to almost $21 per passenger."
Gallagher continued, "Both Las Vegas and Orlando were substantially stronger year-over-year, with Orlando's improvement significantly outpacing that of Las Vegas. Our new destination of Tampa/St. Petersburg continued to be strong during its initial second quarter. However, our third quarter, historically the most challenging, will be even more so if high fuel prices persist. In light of high fuel prices, we are more focused than ever on other costs: in the second quarter, CASM ex-fuel increased only 5.5% over the prior year, despite an 8.3% reduction in system stage length. Given current high fuel prices and recent weaknesses in credit markets, we are pleased our balance sheet remains one of the best in the industry."
Linda Marvin, Allegiant Travel Company CFO, stated, "As of June 30, 2007 cash and short-term investments were $186 million. This balance includes $22 million of net
1
proceeds generated through a secondary stock offering which we completed during the second quarter. With the completion of this secondary offering, more than 50% of Allegiant's stock is now publicly held."
During the second quarter, Allegiant Air initiated service to seven new small cities and on eleven new routes. We recently announced that in the fourth quarter we will add Phoenix-Mesa, Arizona and Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, to our network as our fourth and fifth "world class leisure destinations", basing two aircraft at each city by year-end. These aircraft will serve a total of 25 new routes by December 31, all but one of which will be to an existing small city in the Allegiant Air network.
We have separately announced six other new routes and four other new small cities to be initiated by year-end 2007. We expect to make further new service announcements in the near future. The following table summarizes year-over-year and recent changes in Allegiant Air's scheduled service network:
 
* includes cities served seasonally
Allegiant also leased two additional MD-80 aircraft during the second quarter, one of which was placed in service by quarter end. The other leased MD-80 was placed into service in July, along with an owned MD-80, bringing our current operating fleet to 29 MD-80 aircraft. Additionally, in July we bought eight spare engines, currently leased to another operator, which are scheduled to be returned to us in October. We may continue to lease some of these engines to other operators until such time as we need them.
We also have committed to purchase a total of eight MD-80 aircraft for delivery to us through the first quarter of 2008. Of these eight aircraft, six would come with seller-financing. The following table summarizes year-over-year and recent changes in Allegiant Air's fleet:
 
At this time, Allegiant Travel Company provides the following guidance to investors, which are subject to revision:
2
We expect third quarter Allegiant Air year-over-year ASM growth of at least 29% and departure growth of at least 32%.
                 
We expect fourth quarter 2007 year-over-year ASM growth of at least 40% and departure growth of at least 35%.
                 
We expect full-year 2008 year-over-year ASM growth of at least 30% and departure growth of at least 25%.
                 
By the end of the year, Allegiant Air expects to operate at least 32 MD-80 aircraft. There currently appear to be sufficient high-quality MD-80 aircraft available on the market to support Allegiant Air growth.
                 
The current status of Allegiant Air's fuel hedging program is summarized below:
 
* includes approximately $0.24 per gallon in expenses above the raw cost of jet fuel
We may yet enter into further fuel hedge transactions for September 2007 fuel consumption.

Allegiant Travel Company will host a conference call with analysts at 1 pm EDT tomorrow, August 7, 2007, to discuss our second quarter financial results. A live broadcast of the conference call will be available via the Company's Investor Relations website homepage at

The stock trading plan was adopted in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Company's policies regarding stock transactions by insiders. Rule 10b5-1 allows corporate officers and directors to adopt written, pre-arranged stock trading plans when they are not in possession of material, non-public information. Using these plans, insiders can gradually diversify their investment portfolios, by spreading stock trades out over an extended period of time to reduce any market impact, while avoiding concerns about the initiat ion of stock transactions when in possession of material non-public information. Subject to the terms of the plan, the trust may sell up to 100,000 shares of the Company's stock on or before June 2, 2008. The plan anticipates the sale of 10,000 shares per month. The transactions under this plan are to be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Allegiant Travel Company Reports Third Quarter 2007 Financial Results
Las Vegas, Nev., October 29, 2007 /PRNewswire/  Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ: ALGT), parent company of Allegiant Air and Allegiant Vacations, today reported the following third quarter 2007 results, and comparisons to prior year equivalents:
*Total system includes scheduled service, fixed fee contract and non-revenue flying.
"Our results in the third quarter, historically our weakest, remain in line with our expectations," said Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., Chairman, CEO and President of Allegiant Travel Company. "We more than doubled our operating margin to 11% despite substantial growth: year-over-year scheduled service passengers increased 57%, while scheduled service departures and ASMs were up 44% and 35%, respectively. Notwithstanding these growth rates, our terrific team members produced an excellent on-time operation in the third quarter with 85% of our scheduled service flights, excluding ATC and weather, departing within 15 minutes of scheduled departure and a 100% completion rate on scheduled flights."
Gallagher continued, "Our increased ancillary revenue was the largest contributor to our margin improvement. Our new ancillary products  bag fees and Trip Flex'  helped drive a year-over-year increase in per-passenger ancillary revenue of over $3. With $21 per passenger of ancillary revenue, we also focused on increasing scheduled passengers per departure  125 in 3Q07 up from 115 in 3Q06. This increase was also powerful in driving increased margins. Lastly, I want to congratulate Andrew Levy on his appointment to CFO. He has been critical to our success during the past six years."
Andrew C. Levy, Allegiant Travel Company CFO & Managing Director  Planning, stated, "Our balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong. We ended the quarter with $173 million in cash and short-term investments, down from $186 million at the end of the June quarter due to the purchase of $25.1 million in aircraft and engines to support our fourth quarter and 2008 growth. Cash was used to purchase $17.3 million of these assets with the balance being financed, resulting in an increase in debt of $4.1 million compared with the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations remains strong even during what has historically been our weakest quarter of the year. In the quarter we generated $11.9 million and our total for the first three quarters of 2007 is $62.9 million."
Levy continued, "We are also pleased with our continued good cost management. Cost per ASM, excluding fuel, decreased by 2% over the prior year despite a 3.6% decline in average stage length. Third quarter ex-fuel CASM is even more impressive sequentially, up only 4% versus the prior quarter despite a decrease in ASMs of 2%. Our third quarter ASMs declined sequentially due to the substantial pull down in Florida capacity we impose from August through the end of September to better manage weak seasonal demand we see at that time."
During the third quarter, Allegiant Air initiated service to three new small cities and on four new routes. Since Thursday, October 25, we have initiated service on seven new routes from our fourth "world-class leisure destination" of Phoenix-Mesa, Arizona.
th
By the end of the fourth quarter, we will initiate service on an additional six new routes from Phoenix-Mesa, as well as twelve new routes from our fifth "world-class leisure destination" of Ft. Lauderdale (including one route to the new small city of Plattsburgh, NY) as well as three new routes from Orlando-Sanford, one of which is to the new small city of Bangor, ME. At year end we expect to serve 109 routes (including seasonal service), five "world-class leisure destinations" and 55 small cities. We have recently announced two further routes (including one to a new small city) to be launched in the first quarter of 2008.
 -  includes cities served seasonally
During the third quarter, we purchased three additional MD-80 aircraft, two of which were acquired through capital leases, and one spare engine. We placed two MD-80s in service, bringing our current operating fleet to 29 MD-80 aircraft. Additionally, as previously disclosed, in the third quarter we bought eight spare engines on lease to another operator. Seven of these were returned to us in October and the eighth will be returned to us in the near future post-overhaul. The lease revenue from these engines (and an associated airframe, which we do not intend to operate) appears in the income statement as "Other revenue".
Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we bought one additional MD-80 aircraft which we expect to operate by the end of the year. We also have a commitment to purchase four additional MD-80 aircraft (which come with seller financing) for delivery to us through the first quarter of 2008. We expect to have these aircraft in our operating fleet by the end of the second quarter 2008, for a total operating fleet of 37 MD-80s.
The following table summarizes year-over-year and recent changes in Allegiant Air's fleet:
On October 16, 2007, we disclosed the signing of a fixed-fee contract with a subsidiary of Harrah's Entertainment (HET: NYSE, "Harrah's"). Under this two-year contract, beginning January 1, 2008 we will base two MD-80 aircraft in Tunica, MS to operate fixed-fee services at Harrah's direction from cities around the United States to Tunica, Gulfport/Biloxi, MS, New Orleans, LA, Shreveport, LA, St. Louis, MO and Council Bluffs, IA.
The terms and conditions of this new contract are similar to existing fixed-fee contracts under which we operate 2.5 MD-80 aircraft from Laughlin, NV and Reno, NV for Harrah's. The Reno and Laughlin contracts and flying are unaffected by the new Harrah's contract. The minimum annual fixed-fee contract revenue from the new Harrah's contract will be $11.8 million. As reflected in the guidance below, we expect this new contract to significantly increase our fixed-fee revenue in 2008. However, this increase will not be apparent in the first quarter because we will no longer fly for Apple Vacations from Milwaukee, WI, a contract which resulted in substantial first quarter fixed fee revenue in 2007. We will continue to fly for Apple from Rockford, IL.
Finally, on October 17, 2007, our board of directors elected Andrew Levy, our Managing Director of Planning, to the post of Chief Financial Officer effective that day. Levy will continue to serve as our Managing Director  Planning.
At this time, Allegiant Travel Company provides the following guidance to investors, which are subject to revision:
Allegiant Air is hedged to 9% of its anticipated scheduled service jet fuel consumption for the fourth quarter of 2007 at a price of approximately $2.35 per gallon (including approximately $0.24 per gallon in expenses above the raw cost of jet fuel).

Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, statements in this press release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are only estimates or predictions based on our management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Forward-looking statements include our statements regarding future revenues, future earnings per share, ASM growth, departure growth, fleet growth and expected fuel consumption and expense, as well as information concerning future results of operations, business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, industry environment, potential growth opportunities, the effects of future regulation and the effects of competition. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "estimate", "project" or similar expressions.
Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements generally may be found in our periodic reports and registration statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov. These risk factors include, without limitation, increases in fuel prices, terrorist attacks, risks inherent to airlines, demand for air services to Las Vegas, Orlando, Tampa/St. Petersburg, Phoenix and Ft. Lauderdale from the markets served by us, our ability to implement our growth strategy, our fixed obligations, our dependence on our leisure destination markets, our ability to add, renew or replace gate leases, our competitive environment, problems with our aircraft, dependence on fixed fee customers, our reliance on our automated systems, economic and other conditions in markets in which we operate, governmental regulation, increases in maintenance costs and insurance premiums and cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results.
Any forward-looking statements are based on information available to us today and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of future events, new information or otherwise.
Detailed financial information follows:
(1) Prior to its December 2006 initial public offering, the Company was organized as a limited liability company (LLC) and as such was generally not subject to income taxes, except in certain state and local jurisdictions. The pro-forma tax provision reflects income taxes as if the Company were organized as a corporation effective January 1, 2006.
 -  except load factor and percent of sales through website, which is percentage point change
Unlike many airlines, we do not qualify for fuel hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133. To facilitate investor comparisons with airlines that do qualify for fuel hedge accounting, we provide adjusted non-GAAP measures of net income and operating expense as if we did qualify for fuel hedge accounting, by excluding the mark-to-market non-cash gains or losses on fuel derivatives from net income and by treating cash gains or losses realized on fuel derivatives as part of aircraft fuel expense. We believe use of these non-GAAP measures assists investors in understanding the underlying economic performance of the Company.
The SEC has adopted rules (Regulation G) regulating the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Because of our use of non-GAAP financial measures, Adjusted net income or loss and Adjusted aircraft fuel expense, to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Regulation G requires us to include in this press release a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures, which are Net income or loss (which includes mark-to-market non-cash loss on fuel derivatives), and Aircraft fuel expense (which is not impacted by the cash gain or loss on fuel derivatives), and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures.  Our utilization of non-GAAP measurements is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, aircraft fuel expense and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net income or loss and adjusted aircraft fuel expense are not GAAP measurements and our use of them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies in the airline industry. The reconciliations to GAAP measures follow:
Derivation of adjusted net income (excluding non-cash mark-to-market loss on fuel derivatives) from net income:
Derivation of adjusted aircraft fuel operating expense:
Derivation of operating cost per ASM treating cash (gain) loss on fuel derivatives as part of total operating expense per ASM:
Split of (gain) loss on fuel derivatives into cash-settled portion and mark-to-market non-cash portion:

Allegiant Travel Company Reports Fourth Quarter, Full Year 2007 Financial Results, Announces $25 Million Share Repurchase Program
Las Vegas, Nev., January 29, 2008 /PRNewswire/  Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ: ALGT), parent company of Allegiant Air and Allegiant Vacations, today reported the following fourth quarter and full year 2007 results, and comparisons to prior year equivalents:
*Total system includes scheduled service, fixed fee contract and non-revenue flying.
"2007 was an outstanding year for our company," said Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., Chairman, CEO and President of Allegiant Travel Company. "We grew revenues by 48.2% to $360.6 million, nearly doubled operating profits to $44.0 million, increased pre-tax income 220.6% to $50.7 million and net income by 260.5% to $31.5 million. However, the sharp increase in fuel prices at the end of the year did affect our fourth quarter results, dropping our fourth quarter operating margin by almost half relative to the prior year. We take some small comfort in realizing that had fuel prices remained constant compared with the fourth quarter of 2006, our operating margin would have been almost 19%. We have previously demonstrated the ability, over time, to improve margins in the face of substantial fuel price increases and we fully expect to do so this time as well. We remain confident in our business model, its profitability potential and our ability to execute."
Gallagher continued, "The tremendous efforts of our team members enabled us to achieve a great deal in the fourth quarter. We established three new bases, including two new major leisure destinations of Phoenix, AZ and Ft. Lauderdale, FL, and our new charter base at Tunica, MS to support previously announced new flying for Harrah's Entertainment, each of which supports two MD-80 aircraft. On the revenue front, we succeeded in further increasing system revenue per available seat mile by 7.6% due mostly to a 29.0% year over year increase in ancillary revenue per passenger."
Gallagher concluded, "Lastly our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program to acquire up to $25 million of the Company's common stock. Our strong balance sheet enables us to continually evaluate ways to enhance shareholder value."
Andrew C. Levy, CFO & Managing Director  Planning, stated, "We have made many changes to our route network, our pricing and our future planning in keeping with our goal to deliver double digit operating margins in spite of current high fuel prices. The changes made to date have been effective, but we have more hard work to do to ensure we can reach our margin targets. We remain steadfast in our determination to deliver the highest margins in the industry."
"Our balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong. We ended the quarter with $171.4 million in cash and short-term investments, down from $172.7 million at the end of the September quarter due to the purchase of $17.0 million in aircraft and parts to support our fourth quarter and 2008 growth. Cash was used to purchase $9.8 million of these assets with the balance being financed, resulting in an increase in debt of $3.1 million compared with the prior quarter and largely flat compared with year end 2006. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $11.1 million and our total for the year was $74.0 million."
Levy continued, "We again are pleased with our cost management. Cost per ASM, excluding fuel, decreased by 3.0% compared with the prior year despite a 1.4% decline in average stage length."
During the fourth quarter, Allegiant Air initiated service to two new major leisure destinations (Phoenix and Ft. Lauderdale), two new small cities (Bangor, ME and Plattsburgh, NY) and on 28 new routes. We also resumed our seasonal service from Bellingham, WA to Palm Springs, CA.
 -  includes cities served seasonally
During the fourth quarter, we placed three MD-80s in service, bringing our operating fleet to 32 MD-80 aircraft at year end 2007. We also purchased three additional MD-80 aircraft in the fourth quarter 2007. We placed these three aircraft in service subsequent to year-end 2007 and now have an operating fleet of 35 aircraft. We have a commitment to purchase two additional MD-80 aircraft for delivery to us by the early part of the second quarter of 2008. We expect to have these aircraft in our operating fleet by the end of the second quarter 2008, for a total operating fleet of 37 MD-80s.
The following table summarizes year-over-year and recent changes in Allegiant Air's fleet:
At this time, Allegiant Travel Company provides the following guidance to investors, which are subject to revision:
The Company is hedged to a negligible amount of its anticipated scheduled service jet fuel consumption for the first quarter of 2008 and does not have any fuel hedges for later periods.
Allegiant Travel Company will host a conference call with analysts at 1 pm EST tomorrow, January 30, 2008, to discuss its fourth quarter and year end 2007 financial results. A live broadcast of the conference call will be available via the Company's Investor Relations website homepage at http://ir.allegiantair.com. The webcast will also be archived in the "Events & Presentations" section of the website.

Unlike many airlines, we do not qualify for fuel hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133. To facilitate investor comparisons with airlines that do qualify for fuel hedge accounting, we provide adjusted non-GAAP measures of net income and operating expense as if we did qualify for fuel hedge accounting, by excluding the mark-to-market non-cash gains or losses on fuel derivatives from net income and by treating cash gains or losses realized on fuel derivatives as part of aircraft fuel expense. Adjusted net income for fourth quarter 2006 also eliminates the effect of a one-time tax adjustment recorded upon our conversion from a limited liability company to a corporation at the time of our initial public offering in December 2006. We believe use of these non-GAAP measures assists investors in understanding the underlying economic performance of the Company without regard to different accounting treatment for fuel hedging activities and the transitory effects of changing from an LLC to a C-corporation.
The SEC has adopted rules (Regulation G) regulating the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Because of our use of non-GAAP financial measures, Adjusted net income and Adjusted aircraft fuel expense, to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Regulation G requires us to include in this press release a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures, which are Net income or loss (which reflects the mark-to-market non-cash loss or gain on fuel derivatives and the tax accrual upon our conversion to a corporation), and Aircraft fuel expense (which is not impacted by the cash gain or loss on fuel derivatives), and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures.  Our utilization of non-GAAP measurements is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, aircraft fuel expense and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net income and adjusted aircraft fuel expense are not GAAP measurements and our use of them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies in the airline industry. The reconciliations to GAAP measures follow:
Derivation of adjusted net income (net of one-time tax accrual) from GAAP net income:
Derivation of adjusted net income (excluding non-cash mark-to-market loss or gain on fuel derivatives and one-time tax accrual) from adjusted net income (net of one-time tax accrual) as derived in the table above:
Derivation of adjusted aircraft fuel expense:
Derivation of operating cost per ASM treating cash (gain) loss on fuel derivatives as part of total operating expense per ASM:
Split of (gain) loss on fuel derivatives into cash-settled portion and mark-to-market non-cash portion:

The Company expects to receive approximately $5.5 million in lease revenue from the six aircraft, but expects to incur maintenance obligations of a similar dollar amount prior to the end of the leases. A portion of these maintenance obligations may be funded by supplemental rent received under the leases.

Allegiant Travel Company Reports First Quarter 2008 Financial Results
Las Vegas, Nev., April 28, 2008 /PRNewswire/  Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ: ALGT), parent company of Allegiant Air and Allegiant Vacations, today reported the following first quarter 2008 results, and comparisons to prior year equivalents:
*Total system includes scheduled service, fixed fee contract and non-revenue flying.
"Our first quarter was exceptional, particularly on the revenue side," said Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., Chairman, CEO and President of Allegiant Travel Company. "We grew revenues almost 58% to $133.1 million on just a 48% increase in departures. Our focus on achieving higher loads was successful  our scheduled system had the highest domestic load factor in the industry at 86.9%, a 4.4 percentage point increase from first quarter 2007. Ancillary revenues were again terrific performers, increasing almost $7 per passenger year over year to $25.75, generating an almost 7% year-over-year increase in our total average fare. Ancillary revenues are a key factor in our ability to produce good margins despite substantial increases in our cost of fuel."
Gallagher continued, "We diversified our operations considerably in the past year. Our two new destinations of Phoenix-Mesa and Ft. Lauderdale combined for 17% of our scheduled departures in the first quarter while Las Vegas accounted for 41%, compared to 57% in the same period of the prior year. Orlando accounted for 28% of our first quarter departures in both this year and last, while Tampa Bay/St. Petersburg dropped slightly from 14% to 12% year-over-year in its share of departures. This diversification has greatly improved our risk profile. Fuel expense in the quarter was up over 100% accounting for the reduction in our operating margin to 10.8% from 17% in the first quarter of last year. Once fuel prices stabilize, I am comfortable we will reverse this margin trend."
Andrew C. Levy, CFO & Managing Director  Planning, stated, "We are pleased with our first quarter financial performance. It is particularly gratifying that we posted a 24% increase in economic (excluding the effect of fuel derivatives) earnings per share, despite a 46% increase in fuel price per gallon. While fuel prices were high throughout the first quarter, increases accelerated in March and have continued into April. Should record fuel prices persist, our performance in the second quarter of this year will not match our performance in the second quarter of last year. Despite the challenges of managing our business in the face of record fuel prices, we believe we can remain profitable."
Levy continued, "Our balance sheet and liquidity remain outstanding. We ended the quarter with $188.2 million in cash and short-term investments, up from $171.4 million at year end. Total debt at quarter end stood at $71.0 million, all secured by aircraft."
In January 2008, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to acquire up to $25 million of the Company's common stock. As of March 31, 2008, the Company had repurchased 553,700 shares of the Company's common stock through open market purchases at an average cost of $28.55 per share for a total expenditure of $15.8 million.
During the first quarter, Allegiant Air inaugurated only one new route (Huntington, WV to Tampa Bay/St Petersburg), as the Company concentrated on consolidating the large number of routes initiated in the fourth quarter of 2007. The following table summarizes year-over-year and recent changes to our route network:
 -  includes cities served seasonally
During the first quarter, we placed four MD-80s in service, bringing our operating fleet to 36 MD-80 aircraft. Subsequent to quarter end, we placed another aircraft in service and now have an operating fleet of 37 MD-80 aircraft. The following table summarizes year-over-year and recent changes in Allegiant Air's fleet:
Allegiant Travel Company provides the following guidance to investors, which is subject to revision in the event of changes in our operating environment, including, without limitation, changes in fuel prices:
We have no fuel hedges in place and our current policy is not to hedge fuel prices.
Allegiant Travel Company will host a conference call with analysts at 10am Pacific time tomorrow, April 29, 2008, to discuss its first quarter 2008 financial results. A live broadcast of the conference call will be available via the Company's Investor Relations website homepage at http://ir.allegiantair.com.

Detailed financial information follows:
 -  except load factor and percent of sales through website, which is percentage point change
We do not qualify for fuel hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133. To facilitate investor comparisons with airlines that do qualify for fuel hedge accounting, we provide adjusted non-GAAP measures of net income and operating expense as if we did qualify for fuel hedge accounting, by excluding the mark-to-market non-cash gains or losses on fuel derivatives from net income and by treating cash gains or losses realized on fuel derivatives as part of aircraft fuel expense. We believe use of these non-GAAP measures assists investors in understanding the underlying economic performance of the Company without regard to different accounting treatment for fuel hedging activities.
The SEC has adopted rules (Regulation G) regulating the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Because of our use of non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted net income and adjusted aircraft fuel expense, to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Regulation G requires us to include in this press release a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures, which are net income (which reflects the mark-to-market non-cash loss or gain on fuel derivatives), and aircraft fuel expense (which is not impacted by the cash gain or loss on fuel derivatives), and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures.  Our utilization of non-GAAP measurements is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, aircraft fuel expense and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net income and adjusted aircraft fuel expense are not GAAP measurements and our use of them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies in the airline industry. The reconciliations to GAAP measures follow.
Derivation of adjusted net income (excluding non-cash mark-to-market loss or gain on fuel derivatives) from net income:
Derivation of adjusted aircraft fuel expense:
Derivation of CASM treating cash (gain) loss on fuel derivatives as an operating expense:
Split of (gain) loss on fuel derivatives into cash-settled portion and mark-to-market non-cash portion:

Allegiant Travel Company Reports Second Quarter, Half Year 2008 Financial Results
Las Vegas, Nev., July 22, 2008 /PRNewswire/  Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ: ALGT), parent company of Allegiant Air and Allegiant Vacations, today reported the following second quarter and half year 2008 results, and comparisons to prior year equivalents:
*Total system includes scheduled service, fixed fee contract and non-revenue flying
"We had very good results during our second quarter. In spite of exceptional headwinds from fuel, we are yet again one of the few companies in our space who were profitable," said Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., Chairman, CEO and President of Allegiant Travel Company. "We grew revenues approximately 48% to $132 million on a 36.5% increase in departures. We continued our successful focus on achieving a higher scheduled load factor with 90.5% in the second quarter, a 5.5 percentage point increase over the second quarter of 2007. We believe this was the highest domestic load factor in the industry. Ancillary revenues increased almost $7 per passenger year over year to $27.75, critical to our 15% year-over-year increase in total scheduled RASM. In June we saw a 23% year-over-year increase in total scheduled RASM and a $3 increase in selling fare while our average stage length declined 5.3% to 867 miles compared to last June. This favorable trend has continued into the third quarter."
Gallagher continued, "The silver lining during the past three quarters of increasing fuel prices has been industry capacity cuts. There have been widely publicized capacity reductions in our destination markets, some as high as 15%, year-over-year. But there have also been capacity reductions in our small cities. Further, our markets remain strong as evidenced by June's 94% load factor and 23% increase in total scheduled RASM. Most of our small city markets appear to have missed the recent slow-down in consumer spending."
Andrew C. Levy, CFO & Managing Director  Planning, stated, "Once again, the main story for the quarter is the rapid and significant rise in fuel prices and our ability to continue to produce profits. This is the third consecutive quarter where we have seen a sharp move in the price of jet fuel as measured from the beginning compared with the end of the quarter. Second quarter jet fuel prices increased at an accelerating rate relative to the previous two quarters and were $0.78 per gallon higher at the end of the second quarter than at the beginning, and our average price per gallon was up $1.29 per gallon compared with the second quarter of 2007.
"Maintenance and repair expense was up in the second quarter relative to the prior year primarily due to more scheduled airframe maintenance and engine overhaul events. On a unit cost basis, maintenance and repair expense was negatively impacted by a 7% decline in average stage length, which tends to increase all unit costs.
"Our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong. We ended the quarter with $153.8 million in unrestricted cash and short-term investments, down from $188.2 million at the end of the first quarter. The decline is due principally to the purchase of $25 million in aircraft to support 2009 growth."
During the second quarter, Allegiant Air initiated service on the following five routes: Bellingham, WA to both San Diego and San Francisco, Las Vegas to both Santa Barbara, CA and Monterey, CA and Orlando to Wilmington, NC. We have also announced service from Las Vegas to Grand Forks, ND, and Casper, WY to start in September, and in late August we are moving our Las Vegas to northeastern Wisconsin service from Green Bay to Appleton. We expect to make more new service announcements shortly.
 -  includes cities served seasonally
During the second quarter, we placed one additional (owned) aircraft in service, bringing our operating fleet to 37. At the end of the second quarter, we exercised the purchase option on five aircraft subject to capital lease.
The following table summarizes year-over-year changes in Allegiant Air's fleet:
 -  Does not include six owned MD-80 aircraft leased to a third party
On July 17, 2008, Allegiant Air received a notice of termination from MLT Vacations under which the Charter Services Agreement between the parties will be terminated effective as of October 20, 2008. Under the Agreement, Allegiant Air devoted one aircraft to provide charter services for MLT Vacations from the end of May 2008 through the end of 2009, subject to earlier termination. MLT Vacations cited rising fuel prices and lack of fare improvements as reasons for the contract termination. The aircraft released from the MLT program will be placed into scheduled service in the fourth quarter.
At this time, Allegiant Travel Company provides the following guidance to investors, which are subject to revision:
At this time we have no fuel hedges in place.
Allegiant Travel Company will host a conference call with analysts at 1 pm EST tomorrow, July 23, 2008, to discuss its second quarter and half-year 2008 financial results.

Lauderdale from the markets served by us, our ability to implement our growth strategy, our fixed obligations, our dependence on our leisure destination markets, our ability to add, renew or replace gate leases, our competitive environment, problems with our aircraft, dependence on fixed fee customers, our reliance on our automated systems, economic and other conditions in markets in which we operate, governmental regulation, increases in maintenance costs and insurance premiums and cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results.

We do not qualify for fuel hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133. To facilitate investor comparisons with airlines that do qualify for fuel hedge accounting, we provide adjusted non-GAAP measures of net income and operating expense as if we did qualify for fuel hedge accounting, by excluding the mark-to-market non-cash gains or losses on fuel derivatives from net income and by treating cash gains or losses realized on fuel derivatives as part of aircraft fuel expense. We believe use of these non-GAAP measures assists investors in understanding the underlying economic performance of the Company without regard to different accounting treatment for fuel hedging activities.
The SEC has adopted rules (Regulation G) regulating the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Because of our use of non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted net income and adjusted aircraft fuel expense, to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Regulation G requires us to include in this press release a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures, which are net income (which reflects the mark-to-market non-cash loss or gain on fuel derivatives), and aircraft fuel expense (which is not impacted by the cash gain or loss on fuel derivatives), and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures.  Our utilization of non-GAAP measurements is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, aircraft fuel expense and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net income and adjusted aircraft fuel expense are not GAAP measurements and our use of them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies in the airline industry. The reconciliations to GAAP measures follow.

Las Vegas, Nev., October 21, 2008 /PRNewswire/  Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ: ALGT), parent company of Allegiant Air and Allegiant Vacations, today reported the following third quarter results and comparisons to prior year equivalents:
*Total system includes scheduled service, fixed fee contract and non-revenue flying
"We are very proud of our third quarter financial performance," stated Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., CEO and President of Allegiant Travel Company. "The efforts of our excellent employees enabled us to achieve a great deal in the third quarter. We almost doubled profits sequentially, despite our average fuel price being largely unchanged from the second quarter and in what is seasonally our weakest time of the year. The steps we have taken to adapt to record high fuel prices, namely reducing our long haul flying, trimming capacity in select markets and focusing on increased load factors, are clearly paying off. Capacity reductions allowed us to increase unit revenues substantially  third quarter scheduled service total RASM increased 33% to 12.75 cents compared to the prior year. All our scheduled service revenue drivers improved versus the prior year: ancillary revenue per passenger was up $11 to over $32, average airfare was up $3 to $86 (despite a 7% decline in average stage length) and passengers per flight increased 10% from 125 to 137, increasing load factor to an industry leading 93.8%."
Gallagher continued, "Our strong balance sheet and solid cash position provide a great deal of flexibility in today's financial environment. Looking forward, we have acquired and paid for much of our 2009 growth with our purchase for cash of six aircraft earlier this year which will take us to 43 operating aircraft by the end of 2009. Additionally, our third quarter aircraft utilization was only five block hours per day versus six hours in the prior year due to our capacity management related to higher fuel prices. The recent drop in fuel makes the economics of higher utilization more plausible. Increasing our fleet utilization in the coming year could drive additional growth with minimal investment. Regardless, the recent moderation in the price of oil, should it continue, bodes well for the remainder of 2008 and 2009."
Andrew C. Levy, CFO & Managing Director  Planning, stated, "Our aggressive capacity management has enabled us to remain profitable these past several quarters in a very challenging fuel environment. Due to record high fuel prices this past summer, we designed a fourth quarter schedule with reductions in off-peak capacity which we believe will result in a significant increase in scheduled total RASM. Moreover, our fuel leverage outweighs any other profitability driver in our business and, therefore, we expect record results in the fourth quarter if fuel prices remain near current levels.
"Our costs increased across the board on a unit basis, mainly due to a combination of lower aircraft utilization and a shorter average stage length. Maintenance and repairs had the largest percentage increase year-over-year due to more airframe heavy maintenance events, more engine maintenance events, and higher repair expense.
"Our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong. We ended the quarter with $138.6 million in unrestricted cash and short-term investments, down from $153.8 million at the end of the second quarter. The decline is due principally to the purchase of $8.4 million for aircraft, engines, parts and aircraft leasehold improvements."
 -  includes cities served seasonally
During the third quarter, Allegiant Air initiated service on the following four Las Vegas routes: Appleton, WI (replacing Green Bay, WI), Casper, WY, Grand Forks, ND and Grand Island, NE (replacing Lincoln, NE). We have also announced 18 more routes to start in the fourth quarter (two to Las Vegas, six to Phoenix-Mesa and five each to Orlando-Sanford and St. Petersburg). These new routes include service to five small cities new to the Allegiant network: Bozeman, MT, Elmira, NY, Hagerstown, MD, Kalispell, MT and Lexington, KY. We expect to make further new service announcements shortly.
We are pleased to announce we were recently approved by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) to carry domestic military charter traffic. This enables us to access another important source of ad-hoc charter business. With no prior history with this important new customer, we are unable to reasonably predict how much additional charter business we will obtain from this program, but we believe it will result in a meaningful boost to our fixed-fee revenue.
 -  Does not include six owned MD-80 aircraft leased to a third party
During the third quarter, we exercised a previously-negotiated forward-purchase agreement to purchase, for cash, two previously-leased aircraft. Early in the fourth quarter we took delivery of the first of six aircraft we purchased earlier this year which have been on lease to a European carrier. We expect to place this aircraft into service late in the fourth quarter for a total of 38 aircraft in our operating fleet at year end.
We expect to place the remaining five aircraft into service in 2009, three in the first quarter and two in the fourth quarter, subsequent to their return from the lessee.
At this time, Allegiant Travel Company provides the following guidance to investors, which are subject to revision:
At this time we have no fuel hedges in place.
Allegiant Travel Company will host a conference call with analysts at 1 pm East Coast time tomorrow, October 22, 2008, to discuss its third quarter and nine-month 2008 financial results. A live broadcast of the conference call will be available via the Company's Investor Relations website homepage at http://ir.allegiantair.com.

We do not qualify for fuel hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133. To facilitate investor comparisons with airlines that do qualify for fuel hedge accounting, we provide adjusted non-GAAP measures of net income and operating expense as if we did qualify for fuel hedge accounting, by excluding the mark-to-market non-cash gains or losses on fuel derivatives from net income and by treating cash gains or losses realized on fuel derivatives as part of aircraft fuel expense. We believe use of these non-GAAP measures assists investors in understanding the underlying economic performance of the Company without regard to different accounting treatment for fuel hedging activities.
The SEC has adopted rules (Regulation G) regulating the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Because of our use of non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted net income and adjusted aircraft fuel expense, to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Regulation G requires us to include in this press release a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures, which are net income (which reflects the mark-to-market non-cash loss or gain on fuel derivatives), and aircraft fuel expense (which is not impacted by the cash gain or loss on fuel derivatives), and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures.  Our utilization of non-GAAP measurements is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, aircraft fuel expense and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net income and adjusted aircraft fuel expense are not GAAP measurements and our use of them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies in the airline industry. The reconciliations to GAAP measures follow.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
As of October 31, 2008, Allegiant Travel Company (the "Company") has been informed that a trust beneficially owned by Andrew C. Levy, chief financial officer and managing director-planning of the Company, has adopted a pre-arranged, non-discretionary stock trading plan to sell a portion of its currently owned Company stock systematically over time as part of an individual long-term strategy for asset diversification and estate planning. The stock trading plan was adopted in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Company's policies regarding stock transactions by insiders. Rule 10b5-1 allows corporate officers and directors to adopt written, pre-arranged stock trading plans when they are not in possession of material, non-public information. Using these plans, insiders can gradually diversify their investment portfolios, by spreading stock trades out over an extended period of time to reduce any market impact, while avoid ing concerns about the initiation of stock transactions when in possession of material non-public information. Subject to the terms of the plan, up to 90,000 shares of the Company's stock may be sold for the benefit of the trust during the 12-month period from December 1, 2008 to November 30, 2009. The plan contemplates monthly sales with the amount to be sold each month impacted by the prevailing market price at the time of sale. The transactions under this plan are to be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Las Vegas, Nev., January 26, 2009 /PRNewswire/  Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ: ALGT), parent company of Allegiant Air and Allegiant Vacations, today reported the following financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2008 and comparisons to prior year equivalents:
*Total system includes scheduled service, fixed fee contract and non-revenue flying
Allegiant Travel Company also reported the following balance sheet information:
"We had an outstanding fourth quarter, leading to a double-digit operating margin for the year," stated Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., CEO and President of Allegiant Travel Company. "Similar to prior quarters, we had tuned the airline to handle high fuel prices in the fourth quarter, as evidenced by the year-over-year reduction in capacity, and substantial increases in passengers per departure, load factor and total average air fare. We were therefore well-positioned to benefit from the dramatic collapse in oil prices during the second half of the year. Our fourth quarter fuel price per gallon was down 21% year over year and a stunning 40% sequentially. The resulting reduction in fourth quarter operating cost helped pave the way to a record operating margin, with operating profit surging close to 400% year over year. Once again our team members have risen to the occasion, successfully rolling out 18 new routes in the fourth quarter alone."
Gallagher continued, "Looking forward, we are seeing a tighter booking curve, reduced passenger yields and thus a softer base air fare for our scheduled service operation. We estimate that for the first quarter of 2009 scheduled total average air fare (the sum of air fare plus ancillary revenue per passenger), will be down 4% to 6% over the prior year or between $4 and $7. But this decline in revenue per passenger should be more than offset by our expected reduction in fuel cost per passenger and non-fuel cost per passenger (due to increased aircraft utilization) in the first quarter. Our December fuel cost per passenger was less than $30 compared to an average of $60 during the second and third quarters of 2008 and $55 per passenger in first quarter of 2008. We will continue with our policy of maximizing passengers per departure, and will aim to achieve load factors in-line or, where possible, above those of last year."
Gallagher concluded, "Our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program to acquire up to $25 million of the Company's common stock. This replaces a prior program the Board authorized last year at this time which is expiring. Our financial strength and cash flow generation allows us to continue to judiciously return cash to shareholders. Details of the stock repurchase program can be found in a separate SEC filing to be made tomorrow."
Andrew C. Levy, CFO & Managing Director  Planning, stated, "Our financial performance in the fourth quarter was exceptional, with a helping hand from more reasonable fuel prices. We ended our fuel hedging program about 18 months ago and are therefore fully participating in the rapid decline of fuel prices. Our fuel cost per gallon in December was $1.65.
"We continued to post very high load factors, ancillary revenue per passenger continued to climb, and average scheduled air fare declined proportionally with the reduction in average stage length, driving a total RASM increase of almost 24%. Demand for our product remains robust and we are well positioned to generate strong earnings and free cash flow going forward, assuming fuel prices remain moderate.
"We improved our already excellent balance sheet and liquidity position. We ended the quarter with unrestricted cash and short-term investments of $174.8 million, up from $138.6 million at the end of the prior quarter. Excluding air traffic liability, cash increased from $60.8 million to $105.8 million sequentially. Year-end 2008 total debt was $64.7 million, down from $70.1 million at the end of the prior quarter. We expect 2009 year-end total debt to decline by $25.3 million.
"The rapid deterioration in the global aircraft market has put even more pressure on MD-80 prices and we are able to acquire high quality aircraft at even lower prices than before. Our strong liquidity position enables us to purchase MD-80 aircraft for cash without external financing, so the current credit crisis does not constrain our ability to grow."
 -  Does not include five aircraft owned but not yet placed in service, three of which are currently leased to a third party
During the fourth quarter of 2008, we placed one aircraft in service previously leased to a third party. We expect to place two more such aircraft in service in the first quarter, one more in the second quarter and the last two in the first quarter of 2010. In addition, earlier this month we purchased an additional MD-80 which we expect to place in service late this quarter.
We summarize the state of our scheduled route network below. We added eighteen new scheduled routes during the fourth quarter. In addition, Allegiant Air entered into a one year contract to provide thrice-weekly charter service for the Beau Rivage Resort between Tampa Bay/St. Petersburg and Gulfport, MS. We initiated service on this contract in January.
 -  includes cities served seasonally
At this time, Allegiant Travel Company provides the following guidance to investors. All of these items are subject to revision:
At this time we have no fuel hedges in place.
Allegiant Travel Company will host a conference call with analysts at 1 pm East Coast time tomorrow, January 27, 2009, to discuss its fourth quarter and full-year 2008 financial results. A live broadcast of the conference call will be available via the Company's Investor Relations website homepage at http://ir.allegiantair.com. The webcast will also be archived in the "Events & Presentations" section of the website.

Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, statements in this press release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are only estimates or predictions based on our management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Forward-looking statements include our statements regarding future revenues, debt balance, load factors, ASM growth, departure growth, fleet growth, fuel cost per passenger, non-fuel cost per passenger, increased aircraft utilization and expected capital expenditures, as well as information concerning future results of operations, business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, industry environment, potential growth opportunities, the effects of future regulation and the effects of competition. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "estimate", "project" or similar expressions.
Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements generally may be found in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov. These risk factors include, without limitation, the effect of the economic downturn on leisure travel, increases in fuel prices, terrorist attacks, risks inherent to airlines, demand for air services to Las Vegas, Orlando, Tampa/St. Petersburg, Phoenix-Mesa and Ft. Lauderdale from the markets served by us, our ability to implement our growth strategy, our fixed obligations, our dependence on our leisure destination markets, our ability to add, renew or replace gate leases, our competitive environment, problems with our aircraft, dependence on fixed fee customers, our reliance on our automated systems, economic and other conditions in markets in which we operate, governmental regulation, increases in maintenance costs and insurance premiums and cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results.
Any forward-looking statements are based on information available to us today and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of future events, new information or otherwise.
Detailed financial information follows:
* except load factor and percent of sales through website, which is percentage point change
We do not qualify for fuel hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133. To facilitate investor comparisons with airlines that do qualify for fuel hedge accounting, we provide adjusted non-GAAP measures of net income and operating expense as if we did qualify for fuel hedge accounting, by excluding the mark-to-market non-cash gains or losses on fuel derivatives from net income and by treating cash gains or losses realized on fuel derivatives as part of aircraft fuel expense. We believe use of these non-GAAP measures assists investors in understanding the underlying economic performance of the Company without regard to different accounting treatment for fuel hedging activities.
The SEC has adopted rules (Regulation G) regulating the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Because of our use of non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted net income and adjusted aircraft fuel expense, to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Regulation G requires us to include in this press release a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures, which are net income (which reflects the mark-to-market non-cash loss or gain on fuel derivatives), and aircraft fuel expense (which is not impacted by the cash gain or loss on fuel derivatives), and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures.  Our utilization of non-GAAP measurements is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, aircraft fuel expense and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net income and adjusted aircraft fuel expense are not GAAP measurements and our use of them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies in the airline industry. The reconciliations to GAAP measures follow.
Derivation of adjusted net income (excluding non-cash mark-to-market loss on fuel derivatives) from net income:
Derivation of adjusted aircraft fuel expense:

The SEC has adopted rules (Regulation G) regulating the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Because of our use of non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted net income and adjusted aircraft fuel expense, to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Regulation G requires us to include in this press release a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures, which are net income (which reflects the mark-to-market non-cash loss or gain on fuel derivatives), and aircraft fuel expense (which is not impacted by the cash gain or loss on fuel derivatives), and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures.  Our utilization of non-GAAP measurements is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, aircraft fuel expense and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net income and adjusted aircraft fuel expense are not GAAP measurements and our use of them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies in the airline industry. The reconciliations to GAAP measures follow.
Derivation of adjusted net income (excluding non-cash mark-to-market loss or gain on fuel derivatives) from net income:
Derivation of adjusted aircraft fuel expense:
Derivation of CASM treating cash gain on fuel derivatives as a reduction in operating expense:
Split of (gain) loss on fuel derivatives into cash-settled portion and mark-to-market non-cash portion:

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On March 19, 2009, Allegiant Travel Company (the "Company") acquired the exclusive rights to travel applications of the software operating system the Company has used since its inception. The acquisition will allow the Company to fully control the continuing development of its operating system and Internet offerings and will over the next year eliminate its reliance on its outside vendor (CMS Solutions, Inc.) from whom the Company previously licensed the operating system. The structure of the transaction includes an exclusive perpetual license between CMS Solutions, Inc. and RPW Consolidated Information Systems, Inc. ("RPW"), and then a merger of RPW with and into a newly created wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In consideration for the acquisition, the Company has issued 41,450 shares of its common stock, a portion of which are to be issued to CMS Solutions. Under the license agreement CMS Solutions is obligated to support the system for up to 12 months for a monthly fee. The license agreement also precludes CMS Solutions, for a five year period, from developing or supporting software with similar functionality in the field of travel applications, subject to certain limited exceptions. RPW was owned by Robert P. Wilson, III, who has now been employed by the Company as Vice President of Information Systems. Mr. Wilson was previously employed by CMS Solutions from 1995 until March 2009. Under the terms of an employment agreement entered into between Wilson and the Company, Wilson will be paid a base salary and will be entitled to participate in the Companys bonus plan. Mr. Wilson would receive six months severance pay in the event of termination without cause or resignation for good reason. Mr. Wilson has agreed not to develop or support software with functionality similar to the licensed software during the term of his employment and for a period of six months after termination of employment. Under the merger agreement, the Company will have the right to repurchase up to 34,300 shares issued in connection with the merger at a predetermined price if Wilson resigns from the Company or his employment is terminated with cause within two years.
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement In connection with the transaction described in Item 1.01, the Permanent Software License Agreement dated August 1, 2001, between CMS Solutions and the Company has been terminated.

Las Vegas, Nev., April 19, 2009 /PRNewswire/  Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ: ALGT), parent company of Allegiant Air and Allegiant Vacations, today reported the following financial results for the first quarter 2009 and comparisons to prior year equivalents:
*Total system includes scheduled service, fixed fee contract and non-revenue flying
Allegiant Travel Company also reported the following balance sheet information:
"The first quarter was superb, with an all-time high 31.3% operating margin" stated Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., CEO and President of Allegiant Travel Company. "This quarter marked a return to capacity growth after last year's pullback, with modest growth in departures amplified by increases in passengers per departure and load factor. At over $108 per passenger, we slightly exceeded the range of total scheduled fare per passenger we guided for the quarter. Also consistent with guidance, we increased year-over-year total scheduled RASM by 2.1%. Costs were down substantially, driven by a nearly 50% drop in the per-gallon cost of fuel. The result was a near-tripling of operating margins and record EPS for the company.
"Looking forward, we expect second quarter costs to be substantially lower than the prior year, both because of significantly lower fuel costs and increased utilization. Fuel cost per passenger for the first half of April was slightly more than $26, substantially below the $62.48 we paid in the second quarter of 2008. Increased utilization should drive non-fuel cost per passenger below the prior year's $47.52 per passenger. On the revenue side, travelers continue to book much closer to the time of travel, making projections difficult. For this reason, we will not give revenue guidance at this time. Given current soft fare conditions, total scheduled RASM will decline year-over-year. It will be difficult to improve materially over our 90.5% scheduled load factor in the second quarter of 2008. However, we are confident unit cost savings will thoroughly overwhelm any unit revenue softness, resulting in another strong quarter.
"In some respects, the most important event of the first quarter was our acquisition of key assets from our long-time IT provider, CMS Solutions, as previously disclosed in a SEC filing. CMS has provided the software that runs much of Allegiant, including our reservation system, and the flexibility of our reservation system has been critical to our successful ancillary revenue strategy. We now have a permanent exclusive license for all CMS airline applications and have brought in-house all related development and programming, under the leadership of our new Vice President of Information Systems, Rob Wilson, formerly of CMS. Our CMS relationship has been a cornerstone of our success and we are very pleased this function is now part of the Company."
Andrew C. Levy, CFO & Managing Director  Planning, stated, "We are very pleased with our first quarter financial performance. We held our own in a challenging revenue environment, more than offsetting fare weakness with increased load factors. At the right price we continue to find strong demand for our product. Should fuel prices remain at current levels, earnings and free cash flow will once again be exceptional.
"Our balance sheet metrics continue to lead the industry. We ended the quarter with unrestricted cash and short-term investments of $236.4 million, up from $174.8 million at the end of the prior quarter. Excluding air traffic liability, cash increased from $105.8 million to $132.9 million sequentially. Either measure is substantially in excess of quarter-end total debt of $59.3 million, down from $64.7 million at year end 2008.
"During the quarter, we had $11.5 million in capital expenditures for three aircraft (one already in service with the other two to enter service this quarter), three aircraft for part-out, and miscellaneous other purchases. We expect to continue to be opportunistic in purchasing aircraft for future service growth and part-outs to support our spare engine and rotable parts inventory.
"Lastly, since our previous earnings announcement, we spent $7.1 million in open market transactions to acquire 210,175 shares of the Company's common stock at an average of $33.59 per share under the share re-purchase program our Board of Directors approved in January 2009. Including open market transactions in both 2008 and 2009, the Company has repurchased a total of 763,875 shares at an average price of $29.94 returning a total of $22.9 million to our shareholders."
 -  Does not include five aircraft acquired but not yet placed in service, three of which are currently leased to a third party
During the first quarter of 2009, we placed three owned aircraft in service, two of which were previously leased to a third party. During the first quarter we also entered into operating leases for two MD-80 aircraft which will be placed into service by the end of the second quarter. By the end of the year, we expect to place into service two additional owned aircraft, currently on lease to a third party. In addition, we also own one other aircraft on lease to a third party which we expect to place in service early in 2010. The MD-80 market continues to favor us, allowing us, if we so desire, to easily purchase MD-80s without the need for financing.
Allegiant Air initiated service on four new scheduled routes during the first quarter and announced service to another 18 routes to start during the second quarter, including 13 routes to our new major leisure destination of Los Angeles, with first flights to start May 1. In other highlights, during the quarter we began service to Punta Gorda, FL (just north of Ft. Myers) and announced seasonal service starting at the end of this month to Myrtle Beach, SC. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we also announced new service from Eugene, OR to the San Francisco Bay Area to start in June.
 -  includes cities served seasonally
In addition, Allegiant Air recently entered into fixed fee flying contracts with several different parties to provide charter service between Miami and four Cuban cities in support of the Cuban family charter program, with service to start in June. Allegiant Air will initially commit one aircraft to this program, though we believe expansion is possible. As with all fixed fee flying, Allegiant Air is not exposed to fuel risk under this program.
Lastly, we flew our first ad-hoc charters for the US Department of Defense earlier this month. To date, available DOD opportunities have exceeded our expectations.
At this time, Allegiant Travel Company provides the following guidance to investors. All items are subject to revision:
At this time we have no fuel hedges in place.
Allegiant Travel Company will host a conference call with analysts at 1 pm East Coast time tomorrow, April 20, 2009, to discuss its first quarter 2009 financial results. A live broadcast of the conference call will be available via the Company's Investor Relations website homepage at http://ir.allegiantair.com. The webcast will also be archived in the "Events & Presentations" section of the website.

provided, however
. The Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Selling Stockholders, the directors of the Company, the officers of the Company who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any Selling Stockholder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only with reference to information relating to the Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by the Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
(c) Indemnification of the Company and Selling Stockholders by the Underwriter
(d) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 6(a), (b) or (c), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for (i) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Underwriter and all persons, if any, who control the Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act or who are affiliates of the Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act, (ii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either such Section and (iii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Selling Stockholders and all persons, if any, who control any Selling Stockholder within the meaning of either such Section, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case of any such separate firm for the Underwriter and such control persons and affiliates of the Underwriter, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Underwriter. In the case of any such separate firm for the Company, and such directors, officers and control persons of the Company, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Company. In the case of any such separate firm for the Selling Stockholders and such control persons of any Selling Stockholders, such firm shall be designated in writing by the persons named as attorneys in fact for the Selling Stockholders under the Powers of Attorney. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into, and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
indemnified party
indemnifying party
(e) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 6(a), (b) or (c) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (e)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (e)(i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and of the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Sellers on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Shares shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by each Seller and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriter, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Shares. The relative fault of the Sellers on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Seller or by the Underwriter and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The liability of each Selling Stockholder under the contribution agreement contained in this paragraph shall be limited to an amount equal to the aggregate public offering price of the Shares sold by such Selling Stockholder under this Agreement.
(f) The Sellers and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 6(e). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 6(e) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6, the Underwriter shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that the Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 6 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
(g) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 6 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the Selling Stockholders contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriter, any person controlling the Underwriter or any affiliate of the Underwriter, any Selling Stockholder or any person controlling any Selling Stockholder, or the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Shares.
. The provisions of this Section shall not affect any agreement among the Company and the Selling Stockholder(s) with respect to indemnification.
(h) Other Agreements with Respect to Indemnification
SECTION 7. . This Agreement shall have become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto. If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriter because of any failure or refusal on the part of any Seller to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason any Seller shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Sellers will reimburse the Underwriter for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of the Underwriter's counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriter in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
Effectiveness
SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or the Selling Stockholders submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriter or its Affiliates or selling agents, any person controlling the Underwriter, its officers or directors, any person controlling the Company or any Selling Stockholder and (ii) delivery of and payment for the Shares.

(a) Termination; General.

Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On May 27, 2009, Allegiant Air, LLC ("AAir"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Allegiant Travel Company (the "Company"), entered into a Loan Agreement with Wells Fargo Equipment Finance, Inc. under which AAir borrowed $7.0 million secured by two of AAirs aircraft. The notes evidencing the loan bear interest at the rate of 6.95% per annum and will be amortized in monthly installments over 60 months. The Company has guaranteed the debt. The aircraft pledged to Wells Fargo Equipment Finance, Inc. were previously unencumbered.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
As of May 29, 2009, the Company has been informed that M. Ponder Harrison, a managing director of the Company, has adopted a pre-arranged, non-discretionary stock trading plan to sell a portion of his currently owned Company stock systematically over time as part of an individual long-term strategy for asset diversification and estate planning. The stock trading plan was adopted in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Company's policies regarding stock transactions by insiders. Rule 10b5-1 allows corporate officers and directors to adopt written, pre-arranged stock trading plans when they are not in possession of material, non-public information. Using these plans, insiders can gradually diversify their investment portfolios, by spreading stock trades out over a period of time to reduce any market impact, while avoiding concerns about the initiation of stock transactions when in possession of material non-public inform ation. Subject to the terms of the plan, up to 60,000 shares of the Company's stock may be sold for the benefit of Mr. Harrison between the date of the plan and July 31, 2009. The plan contemplates periodic sales with the timing of each sale impacted by the prevailing market price at the time of sale. The transactions under this plan are to be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Las Vegas, Nev., July 21, 2009 /PRNewswire/  Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ: ALGT), parent company of Allegiant Air and Allegiant Vacations, today reported the following financial results for the second quarter 2009 and comparisons to prior year equivalents:
*Total system includes scheduled service, fixed-fee contract and non-revenue flying
Allegiant Travel Company also reported the following balance sheet information:
"We had another very good quarter, our third highly-profitable quarter in a row," stated Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., CEO and President of Allegiant Travel Company. "In these extremely difficult times when our industry has substantially reduced its operations and seen record declines in unit revenue, we are pleased to report these quality numbers. We increased scheduled departures and ASMs by 30% year over year and still posted a 25% operating and pre-tax margin. Once again our people have been critical to our success. Their enthusiasm and efforts continue to provide our customers with safe, reliable and inexpensive journeys."
"During the quarter we substantially increased the size of our nationwide footprint, including the successful start of 13 new routes to our new Southern California base in Los Angeles and an additional seven new routes across the network, ending the quarter at 134 routes between 71 cities. This further diversifies our exposure to regional economies and offers more protection to us in these uncertain times. Our Southern California routes are off to a great start, with July booked load factors now running ahead of our scheduled average.
"We achieved our second quarter results despite an almost 13% reduction in our average scheduled airfare from the first quarter of this year, a decline attributable to a softer economy, the introduction of new routes, and a 15% increase in year-over-year capacity on a "same-store sales" basis in existing markets. Moreover, for the first time in a number of years, our ancillary revenue per passenger declined sequentially, albeit slightly, to $32.36. An additional challenge relative to the first quarter was a 13% sequential increase in the price per gallon of fuel.
"During the quarter we saw a steady degradation of the revenue environment, year-over-year, from April through June. However, we are hopeful June may mark the bottom of revenue softness. Fares for July, including ancillary, are, thus far, trending slightly upwards, despite the large year-over-year capacity increase we have in this month. An improvement in the revenue environment as well as the recent moderation in fuel prices will help us to extend strong year-over-year earnings growth into the third quarter, historically the seasonally weakest of the year," concluded Gallagher.
Andrew C. Levy, CFO & Managing Director  Planning, stated, "We had terrific cost management in the second quarter. Cost per passenger excluding fuel declined to $46.38 in the second quarter from $47.52 in the prior year and $49.62 in the first quarter. Moreover, these figures include bonus accrual, which has increased substantially in 2009 since it is tied to profitability and therefore disguises underlying cost improvement. Excluding bonus accrual, our cost per passenger excluding fuel declined to $43.84 in the second quarter from $47.26 a year ago and $46.23 in the first quarter.
"Our balance sheet continues to improve. We ended the quarter with unrestricted cash and short-term investments of $228.2 million, down from $236.4 million at the end of the prior quarter. Excluding air traffic liability, cash increased from $132.9 million to $138.3 million sequentially. Either measure is substantially in excess of quarter-end total debt of $60.7 million, up slightly from $59.3 million at year end 2008. During the quarter, we issued $7.0 million in debt at attractive rates, secured by two MD-80 aircraft, and made $5.6 million in principal repayment on existing debt. Note the seasonal reduction in our air traffic liability (representing a use of cash) during the second quarter of $13.5 million was actually less than that of the prior year, when it was $14.9 million.
"During the quarter, we had $7.8 million in capital expenditures mostly for the purchase of engines and improvements made to three aircraft prior to their induction into service. We now expect full year capital expenditures to be about $35 million, due to advancing the introduction of our 46 aircraft into the fourth quarter 2009 as well as a recently executed agreement with Japan Air Lines for the purchase of seven aircraft which will be parted-out to increase our engine and parts inventories. We purchased the first of these aircraft earlier this month and will close on the balance during the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first quarter 2010. We will continue to take advantage of favorable market conditions to opportunistically acquire aircraft, engines and parts.
th
"Lastly, our Board of Directors recently approved an increase of our existing $25 million authority in our Common Stock repurchase program by $10 million to a total of $35 million. Under the share repurchase program our Board of Directors approved in January 2009, we spent $10.5 million in open market transactions during the second quarter to acquire 255,350 shares of the Company's Common Stock at an average price of $41.25 per share. Including open market transactions in the first two quarters of 2009, the Company has repurchased a total of 465,525 shares at an average price of $37.79 returning a total of $17.6 million to our shareholders. With the additional $10 million of authority to repurchase shares that we recently received from our Board of Directors, we currently have $17.4 million in unused authority remaining for open market purchases under our current Common Stock repurchase plan."
 -  Does not include three aircraft acquired but not placed in service as of June 30, 2009, two of which are currently leased to a third party.
During the second quarter of 2009, we placed two leased aircraft in service. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we placed an owned aircraft in service which was previously on lease to a third party. In the fourth quarter, we expect to place in service our final two owned aircraft which are currently on lease to a third party. We expect to continue to add high quality MD-80 aircraft to our fleet at attractive prices without the need for external financing.
In the second quarter, Allegiant Air successfully launched service to our new Southern California base at Los Angeles, with service from 13 small cities. We also inaugurated seasonal service to Myrtle Beach, SC with service from both Allentown, PA and Huntington, WV. Other routes we initiated during the quarter include Grand Rapids, MI and Bentonville, AR to Las Vegas, from Monterey, CA to San Diego and from Eugene, OR to Oakland.
In addition, during the second quarter, Allegiant Air initiated charter service under fixed-fee flying contracts with several different parties between Miami and four Cuban cities in support of the Cuban family charter program. As with all fixed fee flying, Allegiant Air is not exposed to fuel risk under this program.
 -  includes cities served seasonally
At this time, Allegiant Travel Company provides the following guidance to investors. All items are subject to revision:
At this time we have no fuel hedges in place.

Las Vegas, Nev., October 19, 2009 /PRNewswire/  Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ: ALGT), parent company of Allegiant Air and Allegiant Vacations, today reported the following financial results for the third quarter 2009 and comparisons to prior year equivalents:
*Total system includes scheduled service, fixed-fee contract and non-revenue flying
Allegiant Travel Company also reported the following balance sheet information:
"We are pleased to report these very strong results in not only our historically weakest quarter, but also in what has been an exceptionally trying economic environment" stated Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., Chairman and CEO of Allegiant Travel Company. "Moreover these results were produced with a 47% increase in scheduled service departures over the third quarter of 2008. In the third quarter of 2008, we squeezed capacity hard to compensate for extraordinarily high fuel prices. This year we returned to more normal third-quarter aircraft utilization which in combination with a seven-aircraft increase in our fleet resulted in high year-over-year growth against a backdrop of continued industry capacity cuts. Notwithstanding our somewhat dramatic snap-back of capacity, our unit revenue declines were largely in-line with the industry and we produced a record third quarter 16% operating margin and a 182% increase in net income, validating our decision to return to a business-as-usual' third quarter.
"Looking forward, we are cautiously optimistic that better times are in the offing. Scheduled fares, both air fare and ancillary per passenger, bounced off their lows of the second quarter. It's a little early to declare victory, but we certainly like the trend, which is continuing into the fourth quarter. Speaking of the fourth quarter, please note that last year we enjoyed a powerful combination of low fuel prices and air fares that had not declined, which makes the fourth quarter of 2008 a very difficult comp.
"I am very pleased to note that, as is more fully described in a separate press release, Andrew C. Levy, our long-time Managing Director  Planning and CFO, has been promoted by our Board of Directors to the position of President of Allegiant Travel Company. Andrew has been integral to the successful rebirth of Allegiant since 2001, and this promotion recognizes his central role in directing this endeavor. Andrew retains the title of CFO.
"We also received some nice recognition recently when Allegiant Travel Company was ranked second in the 2009 edition of the Forbes Magazine "200 Best Small Companies" list. This is, as much as anything, a tribute to our excellent team members who have done a terrific job during these difficult economic times, particularly as the industry experienced unprecedented revenue declines this spring and summer," concluded Gallagher.
Andrew C. Levy, President & CFO, stated, "Cost management was excellent in the third quarter, with a material benefit from our decision to return utilization to a more normal level. Cost per passenger excluding fuel declined to $50.31 in the third quarter from $53.33 in the prior year, which understates the improvement since system load factor was 3.8 percentage points lower than last year. Please note these figures include bonus accrual, which has increased significantly in 2009 since it is tied to profitability and therefore further disguises underlying cost improvement. Excluding bonus accrual, cost per passenger excluding fuel declined to $48.70 in the quarter from $52.50 a year ago.
"Our balance sheet continues to be among the strongest in the industry. We ended the quarter with unrestricted cash and short-term investments of $222.4 million, down from $228.2 million at the end of the prior quarter. Our unrestricted cash usually dips from the end of the second quarter to the end of the third driven by seasonally lower advance sales but the reduction this year is significantly less than in each of the three prior years. Excluding air traffic liability, cash decreased slightly from $138.3 million to $138.1 million sequentially. Our debt outstanding declined from $60.7 million at June 30, 2009 to $54.8 million at September 30. Capital expenditures during the third quarter were $5.8 million, mostly for the purchase of three part-out aircraft, improvements made to an aircraft prior to its placement in service and the purchase of ground service equipment.
"Given our strong financial position, we continue to evaluate the market for opportunistic purchases of high-quality MD-80 aircraft, which has the potential to substantially impact 2009 and/or 2010 capital expenditure guidance," Levy concluded.
Under the share repurchase program our Board of Directors approved in January 2009 and amended in July, we spent $6.8 million in open market transactions during the third quarter to acquire 172,377 shares of the Company's Common Stock at an average price of $39.52 per share. In the first three quarters of 2009, the Company spent $24.4 million in open market transactions repurchasing a total of 637,902 shares at an average price of $38.26 per share. We currently have a total of $10.6 million in unused stock repurchase authority remaining under our current Common Stock repurchase plan.
 -  Does not include two aircraft acquired but not placed in service as of September 30, 2009.
During the third quarter of 2009, we placed one owned aircraft in service. In the fourth quarter, we expect to place in service two owned aircraft, one before Thanksgiving and the other before the Winter holiday. These are the final two deliveries to Allegiant of six MD-80s we acquired in 2008 that were on lease with a third party. We expect to continue to add high quality MD-80 aircraft to our fleet at attractive prices without the need for external financing.
In the third quarter, Allegiant Air announced nine new routes to begin in the fourth quarter, including five routes to Phoenix-Mesa, two to Orlando, and one each to Tampa Bay/St. Petersburg and Ft. Lauderdale.
 -  includes cities served seasonally
At this time, Allegiant Travel Company provides the following guidance to investors. All items are subject to revision. Allegiant Air expects:
At this time we have no fuel hedges in place.

Las Vegas, Nev., January 25, 2010 /PRNewswire/  Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ: ALGT), parent company of Allegiant Air and Allegiant Vacations, today reported the following financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2009 and comparisons to prior year equivalents:
*Total system includes scheduled service, fixed-fee contract and non-revenue flying
Allegiant Travel Company also reported the following balance sheet information:
"We are pleased to announce a record annual profit of $76 million or $3.76 per share with an operating margin of 21.9% for 2009," stated Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., Chairman and CEO of Allegiant Travel Company. "Our fourth quarter results represent our 28 consecutive quarter of profitability. Given the difficult economic environment of the past year we are proud of our performance. We accomplished these excellent results while growing significantly (a 22% increase in departures versus the prior year) and despite a 17% decline in scheduled air fare (what I call our "selling fare") to $70 from $85. However, during these difficult times, our 2009 total ancillary revenue per scheduled passenger grew 12% to approximately $33.

"We are particularly pleased with the trend in revenue growth during this past quarter. Our selling fare increased from $67 in October to $83 in December, the highest average fare for any month of 2009 and only slightly below the selling fare in December 2008  the best year over year comparison for any month of 2009. Additionally, the total scheduled service average fare for December 2009 exceeded that of December 2008, although TRASM was down 2% in the same periods. Lastly, we achieved a $31 operating profit per passenger in December, our third best monthly result of the year in spite of fuel up over 40% from those earlier months.
"I couldn't be more pleased with the evolution of our model," Gallagher continued. "We achieved a 26.5% return on equity during the year. Further, on a per aircraft basis, our 2009 combined operating income and depreciation and amortization was roughly $3.5 million, approximating the amount we currently spend to add an aircraft to our operating fleet. The great efforts of our terrific team members were again critical to achieving our successful results in 2009.
"Looking forward, we currently see an improving pricing environment. While the economy is in the early stages of a recovery, our segment appears to be returning to revenue norms of past years. Our recently announced contract for additional aircraft should add 13 aircraft to our operating fleet and support our growth through 2011.
"A major initiative in 2010 will be an upgrade to our IT systems including our database and hardware infrastructure. These upgrades will provide us with the necessary capacity to continue our growth as well as enhance our ability to offer industry leading web based products. Our control of our automation provides us the ability to develop our own, unique products and this is a substantial differentiator for us in the travel industry," concluded Gallagher.
Andrew C. Levy, President and CFO, stated, "This quarter was difficult from a cost perspective, with the $2.07 per gallon fuel price the highest since 4Q08, and non-fuel expenses unusually high in the `Maintenance and Repairs' and `Other' expense areas. As we noted at our investor day in mid-November, we experienced a large quantity of very expensive airframe heavy maintenance events during the quarter. We expect maintenance expenses to return to more normal levels in 2010, to a range of $95,000 to $105,000 per aircraft per month.
"We also discussed our expectation that our `Other' expense line would be high during fourth quarter 2009. This increase was driven by an approximate $1.5 million non-recurring write down of the value of engine parts we own for sale to others and an unusually large loss on the disposal of engines which had to be taken off wing prematurely and will be parted out. The loss on disposed items averaged just under $600,000 per quarter in the preceding seven quarters, but it was approximately $1.5 million during 4Q09. However, we believe the unusually high cost per passenger of $57.93 was driven by events unique to this quarter and our non-fuel expenses will revert to the more normal levels of approximately $50 per passenger starting in this first quarter of 2010.
"Our balance sheet continues to strengthen. We ended the quarter with unrestricted cash and short-term investments of $231.5 million, up from $222.4 million at the end of the prior quarter and $174.8 million at the end of the prior year. Excluding air traffic liability, cash increased to $140.9 million at December 31, 2009 from $138.1 million at the end of the prior quarter and $105.8 million at the end of the prior year. Total debt outstanding declined to $45.8 million from $54.8 million and $64.7 million over the same periods. Capital expenditures were $6.0 million during the fourth quarter and $31.7 million for the year.
"As previously announced, on February 1 we start service to our new base of Orlando International Airport. By March we will be flying to Orlando International from 10 of the 31 small city markets from which we currently fly to Orlando-Sanford International Airport. We undertook this initiative to improve our competitiveness in the Orlando market. The strength of these 10 markets has far exceeded our expectations and we see very positive trends continuing for our Orlando International service," concluded Levy.
We purchased no shares in the fourth quarter of 2009 under the share repurchase program our Board of Directors approved in January 2009 and amended in July. In the first three quarters of 2009 the Company spent $24.4 million in open market transactions repurchasing a total of 637,902 shares at an average price of $38.26 per share. We currently have a total of $10.6 million in unused stock repurchase authority remaining under our current Common Stock repurchase plan.
Please note our 2009 Consolidated Statements of Income reflect certain presentation changes and reclassifications within operating revenue. We are now separately presenting two categories of ancillary revenue, breaking them into third-party products and air-related charges, which we think will provide investors with useful insight into this important revenue line. We have applied these presentation changes and reclassifications to our 2008 Consolidated Statements of Income to conform to the 2009 classifications. These changes have no effect on previously-reported Net Income. We will be separately filing an 8-K to provide historical perspective on this new way of viewing our revenues.
We are also now providing more detail into our third-party products business as presented in the table below, "Supplemental Ancillary Revenue Information." Third party products consist of revenue from the sale of hotel rooms, ground transportation (rental cars and hotel shuttle products), attraction and show tickets, and fees we receive from other merchants selling products through our website. Ancillary revenue  third party products is gross revenues, minus cost of goods sold and transaction costs, which include both travel agent commissions (if applicable) and credit-card discount fees.
(a) includes credit card fees and travel agency commissions
During the fourth quarter of 2009 we placed two owned aircraft in service, the final two deliveries to Allegiant of six MD-80s we acquired in 2008 that were on lease with a third party. As previously announced, we expect to place two more owned MD-80s in operation in the first quarter of 2010. At the start of the second quarter, we expect to permanently withdraw from service one of our four owned 130-seat MD-87 aircraft (which operate almost solely for our fixed-fee programs).
Allegiant Air started nine new routes in the fourth quarter, including five routes to Phoenix-Mesa, two to Orlando, and one each to Tampa Bay/St. Petersburg and Ft. Lauderdale. We expect to announce additional new service in the near future. In particular we expect to build on our successful Summer 2009 Myrtle Beach program and we will shortly announce an aircraft and crew base that is not a major leisure destination, similar to the successful base we operate in Bellingham, WA.
 -  includes cities served seasonally

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Supplemental information provided to investors regarding Allegiant Travel Company's recently announced forward purchase of six 757s, which Allegiant intends to use to serve Hawaii.
 
     
Expected 757-related capital expenditures for 2010: $40mm
     
Expected 757-related capital expenditures for 2011: $40mm
     
Expected number of seats of each aircraft: between 200 and 220.
     
Expected departures per 757 aircraft per day: 1.5
     
Timing of start of 757 service to Hawaii: Approximately 120 days after receipt of extended twin-engine operations ("ETOPS") certification from the FAA. We believe this is mostly likely to be first quarter 2011, however, this cannot be assured as the grant of ETOPS certification depends on the FAA determining that Allegiant has met the ETOPS requirements, which need not happen on any particular schedule.
     
Assuming 757 service to Hawaii starts in the first quarter of 2011, 757 program departures should account for less than 5% of total Allegiant departures in 2011 and 2012.
     
These 757 aircraft are powered by Rolls-Royce RB211-535E4 engines.
     
Average age of the six 757s: 17 years
     
Average number of cycles of the six 757s as of June, 2009 : 19,000

Las Vegas, Nev., April 19, 2010 /PRNewswire/  Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ: ALGT), parent company of Allegiant Air and Allegiant Vacations, today reported the following financial results for first quarter 2010 and comparisons to prior year equivalents:
*Total system includes scheduled service, fixed-fee contract and non-revenue flying
Allegiant Travel Company also reported the following balance sheet information:
"We are pleased to announce our 29 consecutive profitable quarter with the results of the first quarter of 2010," stated Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., Chairman and CEO of Allegiant Travel Company. "Our first quarter results continue to reaffirm the stability and strength of our model. This is the fifth year in a row where our first quarter operating profit percentage has been double digit. The 31% operating margin we achieved in the first quarter of 2009 benefited from the lowest quarterly fuel prices in over five years ($1.47 per gallon). This year, in spite of a 48% increase in fuel price to $2.17 per gallon, we nonetheless achieved a 21% operating margin.
th
"We continued growing during this quarter. Average aircraft in operation increased by seven (46 vs 39) versus the prior year. On a system basis, we generated 17% more ASMs, 10% more departures and 11% more passengers. Southern California flying and other longer routes drove a 6.5% increase in our scheduled service average stage length from 887 in the first quarter of last year to 945 miles this year.
"Improving unit revenues are also part of the story. We generated a $116.49 average fare per scheduled passenger versus $108.61, a nearly $8 increase compared to the first quarter last year. Sequentially, unit revenues were also up 7% from $108.59 in the fourth quarter of 2009, another sign of an improving economy. And TRASM also increased 2.4% year-over-year despite the significant increase in stage length.
"This quarter also marked our eighth consecutive quarter of load factors near or above 90%. Beginning in the second quarter of 2008, we increased our focus on filling aircraft to take advantage of strong ancillary revenues and reduce per-passenger costs by spreading costs, particularly fuel, over more passengers. This strategy has worked well and we plan to continue this approach indefinitely.
"Looking forward, we are excited about our prospects. Our Team Members continue to perform exceptionally well. We were able to reward all eligible employees with profit-sharing checks in the first quarter  our third year running for this company-wide program. We began service to Orlando International Airport on February 1 and most recently announced plans to begin Hawaii service. To that end, we entered into a contract to purchase six Boeing 757-200 series aircraft and closed on the first two aircraft in March. We are targeting operational authority by the end of 2010 and we expect to begin service shortly thereafter," concluded Gallagher.
st
Andrew C. Levy, President and Chief Financial Officer stated, "We remain pleased with our cost management. Operating expense per passenger, excluding fuel, was up only 6.6% to $52.89 despite the increase in average stage length and a 6.3% decline in departures per aircraft. The increase in fuel price and the longer stage length resulted in a $14 increase in fuel expense per passenger from $25.80 to $39.91.
"Despite a 72% increase in fuel expense, we generated $44.8 million in EBITDA, down from $51.4 million in the first quarter of 2009. We ended the quarter with unrestricted cash and short-term investments of $249.2 million, up from $231.5 million at the end of the prior quarter. Excluding air traffic liability, cash declined to $127.4 million from $140.9 million at the end of 2009, while over the same timeframe total debt outstanding declined to $39.4 million from $45.8 million.
"Capital expenditures (including deposits made in prior periods) were $40.0 million during the first quarter, almost all of which was related to aircraft. In the first quarter of 2010 we made open-market purchases of 55,602 shares at an average per-share price of $51.29 for total consideration of $2.9 million under the share repurchase program our Board of Directors approved in January 2009 and most recently amended in January 2010. We currently have a total of $22.1 million in unused stock repurchase authority remaining under our current Common Stock repurchase plan.
"Lastly, we are pleased with our performance in the third party ancillary segment. Gross ancillary revenue was up 26.2% to $22.5 million, mostly driven by a year-over-year increase in non-Las Vegas hotels and transportation (rental cars and hotel shuttles). Our margin declined largely due to the diminution in net revenue contribution from a merchant that provides us with a commission based on sales of an online subscription coupon product, combined with lower margins on transportation products. Net revenue increased 3.9% on a year-over-year basis," concluded Levy.
(a) includes credit card fees and travel agency commissions
During the first quarter of 2010 we placed one owned 150-seat MD-80 aircraft into service. We placed a second owned 150-seat MD-80 aircraft into service early in the second quarter, in conjunction with the previously announced planned permanent withdrawal of one MD-87 aircraft on April 1 (our 130-seat MD-87 fleet, now numbering three, operates almost exclusively for our fixed-fee programs). By the end of the second quarter 2010, we expect to have an operating fleet of 50 MD-80 aircraft (including our three remaining MD-87 aircraft).
Allegiant Air did not start any new scheduled routes in the first quarter of 2010. During the first quarter, we announced eight new routes to start in the second quarter, including four to Myrtle Beach, three to our Los Angeles base in Southern California, and one route to Phoenix-Mesa. We expect to make further new route announcements in the near future.
 -  includes cities served seasonally
At this time, Allegiant Travel Company provides the following guidance to investors. All items are subject to revision. Allegiant Air expects:
At this time we have no fuel hedges in place.

A live broadcast of the conference call will be available via the Company's Investor Relations website homepage at .

Detailed financial information follows:
* except load factor and percent of sales through website, which is percentage point change
"EBITDA" represents earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a calculation based on generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating income as indicators of our financial performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. In addition, our calculation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. EBITDA is included as a supplemental disclosure because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance. Further, EBITDA is a well-recognized performance measurement that is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in comparing the operating performance of companies. We believe EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to our competitors because its calculation generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which items may vary between periods and for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. The following represents the reconciliation of EBITDA to net income for the periods indicated below.
The SEC has adopted rules (Regulation G) regulating the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Because of our use of non-GAAP financial measure EBITDA to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Regulation G requires us to include in this press release a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income, and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP measure.  Our utilization of a non-GAAP measurement is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is not a GAAP measurement and our use of it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies in the airline industry. The reconciliations to GAAP measures follow.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
As of May 27, 2010, Allegiant Travel Company (the "Company") has been informed that Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the Company, and an entity controlled by him have each adopted a pre-arranged, non-discretionary stock trading plan to sell a portion of their currently owned Company stock systematically over time as part of an individual long-term strategy for asset diversification and estate planning. The stock trading plan was adopted in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Company's policies regarding stock transactions by insiders. Rule 10b5-1 allows corporate officers and directors to adopt written, pre-arranged stock trading plans when they are not in possession of material, non-public information. Using these plans, insiders can gradually diversify their investment portfolios, by spreading stock trades out over an extended period of time to reduce any market impact, while avoiding concerns about the initiation of stock transactions when in possession of material non-public information. Subject to the terms of the plan, up to 250,000 shares of the Company's stock may be sold for the benefit of Mr. Gallagher and the controlled entity during the 12-month period from June 1, 2010 to May 31, 2011. The plan contemplates sales periodically with the number of shares to be sold in each sale impacted by the prevailing market price at the time of sale. The transactions under this plan are to be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Las Vegas, Nev., July 20, 2010 /PRNewswire/  Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ: ALGT), parent company of Allegiant Air and Allegiant Vacations, today reported the following financial results for the second quarter 2010 and comparisons to prior year equivalents:
*Total system includes scheduled service, fixed-fee contract and non-revenue flying
"We had another excellent quarter generating a 16.7% operating margin," stated Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., Chairman and CEO of Allegiant Travel Company. "This represents our 30 consecutive profitable quarter and 7 in a row with double digit operating and pre-tax margins. A critical component of our performance this quarter was the continued improvement in our unit revenues compared to the second quarter 2009. As you can see from the table above, all revenue metrics for scheduled service increased year over year, including both our average scheduled service and ancillary fares, TRASM and load factor."
th
th
"Fuel expense has increased substantially year over year," Gallagher continued, "Since Q2 last year, we have seen our scheduled service fuel cost per gallon increase $0.64 or 36% to $2.42. Sequentially, we saw a 4% increase from the first quarter 2010. Revenues, while up nicely year over year, did not keep pace with the rise in fuel prices which resulted in an operating margin below our 20% goal and down from our performance in the second quarter of 2009. At the moment, we see a stable revenue environment and the futures curve for jet fuel implies stable jet fuel prices through the back half of the year. As such, we will slow our planned growth and we now plan to operate 51 MD80 aircraft by year end, one more than we currently operate and one less than we had previously anticipated."
"While we will be limiting our in service fleet growth for the remainder of the year, by the end of this quarter, we will have nine owned MD80's in storage. These aircraft will fund our MD80 growth needs through 2011 and 2012. The MD80 continues to be a work horse for us and is our aircraft of choice for our growth in the lower 48. Our efforts on the 757 certification are progressing and we hope to be permitted to start service to Hawaii sometime in the first half of 2011. We are working closely with the FAA to obtain the necessary authorizations."
"We placed our 50 aircraft in service in June, a milestone for the company. This represents a 16% increase from the second quarter 2009 or seven additional aircraft in the past year. Once again, our team members have been critical to our success. In the past nine years we have built a company with an enviable track record, providing service to smaller communities. Our low-fare, safe, reliable service has provided air service to millions of new travelers who prior to our offerings had limited access to the national transportation system."
th
"Lastly, we were recently named the number one low cost carrier in the world for 2009 by Aviation Week. This award is based on our performance in a number of financial areas, including Earnings Performance, Financial Health and Liquidity. This award recognizes our efforts to generate top tier financial results from our operations and we are very proud to receive this recognition. Again, this award is a fitting tribute to the hard work and dedication of our people and the excellent service we provide to our customers," concluded Gallagher.
Andrew C. Levy, President stated, "Our cost management was relatively good during this quarter. Our operating expense per passenger excluding fuel increased 9.1% to $50.61 due largely to a 5% increase in average stage length. The "other" cost category increased by almost 36% and is therefore worth highlighting. This category includes a variety of expenses, but if we remove expenses associated with non-recurring projects including our intended debt offering, 757 and large IT projects, the cost increase would be only 13.8%, consistent with our growth in revenue. Nonetheless, we will have ongoing investments the remainder of the year in our 757 effort as well as the changeover we are undergoing in IT. We will continue to be vigilant and focused on maintaining the very substantial cost advantage we enjoy as compared with other low cost carriers in the US marketplace."
"We have spoken at length about the importance of growing our third party ancillary revenue segment which is truly a unique part of our business. This quarter saw the first concrete results stemming from these efforts. Our net revenues were $7.2 million, or almost 26% of our income before taxes, up almost 33% year over year. This increase was driven by a 28% increase in our gross revenues as well as an improvement in our gross margins to 27.7% from 26.7%. Our third party ancillary revenue per passenger increased to $4.87, up 24.5% and the highest it has been in any quarter since 4Q08."
"We continue to strengthen our Las Vegas hotel franchise, but we are also seeing substantial growth in our merchant model hotel business in all of our other destinations, particularly Florida. We also are seeing meaningful increases in our transportation segment. We expect this momentum to continue and are very excited about the growth prospects of this business segment, especially after our automation projects are completed and our planned entrance into the Hawaii market next year."
(a) includes credit card fees and travel agency commissions
Levy concluded, "While we are slowing down our planned growth for the second half of the year, especially during the 4 quarter, as you can see from the guidance, we will still grow at a brisk pace. However, it is worth noting that the majority of our growth is associated with the extension of our network into new routes as opposed to simply adding capacity in existing markets. Over the years, we have been able to expand our network very profitably by adding more small cities and connecting the dots between existing small city markets and destinations we already serve. We will be growing in both ways during the 4 quarter and new service announcements are forthcoming in the next few weeks."
th
th
Scott Sheldon, Chief Financial Officer stated, "We ended the quarter with unrestricted cash and short-term investments of $185.4 million, down from $249.2 million at the end of the prior quarter while total debt outstanding, including capital leases, declined to $34.1 million from $39.4 million. We used our balance sheet for several opportunistic deals, including a previously disclosed agreement for access to hotel inventory with one of our key Las Vegas hotel partners. We also spent $19.3 million in capital expenditures to acquire six MD80 aircraft, spare engines and parts."
"We continued to repurchase shares under our Board authorized share repurchase program. In the second quarter of 2010 we made open-market purchases of 197,046 shares at an average per-share price of $52.18 for total consideration of $10.3 million. We currently have a total of $11.9 million in unused stock repurchase authority remaining under our current Common Stock repurchase plan."
"Due to our ability to generate strong cash flows from operations and in an effort to return additional value to shareholders, the company declared a cash dividend of $0.75 per share during the second quarter 2010 resulting in a cash payment of $14.9 million. We will continue to evaluate ways to give excess cash back to our shareholders while continuing to grow our business at a reasonable pace," Sheldon concluded.
During the second quarter of 2010 we placed four owned 150-seat MD80 aircraft into service and we permanently retired one 130-seat MD87. Our 130-seat MD87 fleet, now numbering three, operates almost exclusively for our fixed-fee programs. By the end of the third quarter 2010, we expect to have an operating fleet of 51 MD80 aircraft (including our three remaining MD87 aircraft).
Allegiant Air announced four new routes to start in the third quarter, three to Long Beach, CA and one to Phoenix-Mesa. We expect to announce in the coming weeks several more routes which will start during the fourth quarter.
 -  includes cities served seasonally
At this time, Allegiant Travel Company provides the following guidance to investors, subject to revision.
At this time we have no fuel hedges in place.

"EBITDA" represents earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a calculation based on generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating income as indicators of our financial performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. In addition, our calculation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. EBITDA is included as a supplemental disclosure because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance. Further, EBITDA is a well-recognized performance measurement that is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in comparing the operating performance of companies. We believe EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to our competitors because its calculation generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which items may vary between periods and for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. The following represents the reconciliation of EBITDA to net income for the periods indicated below.
The SEC has adopted rules (Regulation G) regulating the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Because of our use of non-GAAP financial measure EBITDA to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Regulation G requires us to include in this press release a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income, and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP measure.  Our utilization of a non-GAAP measurement is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is not a GAAP measurement and our use of it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies in the airline industry. The reconciliations to GAAP measures follow.

Las Vegas, Nev., October 27, 2010 /PRNewswire/  Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ: ALGT), parent company of Allegiant Air and Allegiant Vacations, today reported the following financial results for the 3 quarter 2010 and comparisons to prior year equivalents:
rd
*Total system includes scheduled service, fixed-fee contract and non-revenue flying
"We had another excellent quarter, generating an 11.9% operating margin in our historically weakest quarter," stated Maurice J. Gallagher Jr., Chairman and CEO of Allegiant Travel Company. "This represents our 31 consecutive profitable quarter and 8 in a row with double digit operating and pre-tax margins. This is our second most profitable 3 quarter since 2005, both in absolute terms and on a percentage basis. We accomplished these results with a scheduled service capacity increase of 24% on a 16% increase in aircraft in service year over year.
st
th
rd
"This summer we felt the effects of the slowdown in the general economy, particularly at the consumer level. Unlike business oriented carriers, this slow down, combined with our substantial growth, led to smaller unit revenue increases than anticipated. As we have done in the past, we have reduced capacity in the coming quarters to allow us to push unit revenues accordingly. This is critical as we continue to see increases in our energy costs per passenger. This quarter our fuel cost per passenger increased $7.39  a 23% increase year over year. We are seeing near term strength in unit revenues and expect October's PRASM to increase approximately 9 to10% on a year over year basis.
"Our $52.34 per passenger ex-fuel expense came in at the bottom end of the $52 to $54 per passenger range we guided to in the 2 quarter 2010 release. This 4% year over year increase is well within our comfort level; particularly given our stage length increased almost 6%. As we have said many times over the years, our cost advantage is a critical asset, one that must be guarded closely. Our cost/ASM ex-fuel for the 3 quarter 2010 was down 0.6% versus the same quarter last year and is more than 30% lower than the nearest LCC.
nd
rd
"We are continuing to expand our number of small cities served. With the recent announcements of five new small cities, we will soon be in over 70 total cities. These new small cities expand our brand to markets without current, nonstop service to one of our many leisure destinations. We currently provide service on 145 separate routes (with direct competition on only eight).
"Lastly, we announced yesterday we are consolidating our Orlando operation back to our original base at Orlando Sanford International Airport. We appreciate the support the Orlando International Airport (MCO) provided us during the past year, but in reviewing our operations and our focus on simplicity and costs, returning to Sanford is the right move for us," concluded Gallagher.
Andrew C. Levy, President of Allegiant Travel Company, stated, "We have adjusted our forward capacity plans taking into account the futures curve expectations for fuel prices and assuming no improvement in the demand environment. The result is a deceleration of our growth rate starting with this current 4 quarter during which we expect scheduled service capacity growth to increase between 13 to 15%, down from the 24% growth rate we experienced in the 3 quarter and down from the 17 to 19% we previously forecasted for 4 quarter 2010. Capacity on routes where we have had a presence for at least one year ("same stores") will increase by approximately 3%, so the majority of our growth will come from service on new routes which include a combination of new small cities and connecting existing small cities with new service to an existing Allegiant destination.
th
rd
th
"Our current plans for 1 quarter 2011 show modest capacity growth of 4 to 7%, but the change in same store capacity is forecast to be down almost 8% year over year during that period. We still have time to adjust capacity in the 1 quarter if warranted, but we are comfortable with our current plan and do not expect any material changes.
st
st
"Since the vast majority of our routes have no direct competition, adjustments to our capacity tend to have a direct effect on unit revenue. We are seeing this in October, as previously mentioned by Maury, and expect this effect to carry through the quarter. We are very encouraged by our forward bookings through the end of the year and are pleased with the performance of routes we recently added to the network.
"Our third-party business continues to perform well. Revenue grew by 32% year over year to $6.7 million, driven by increases in volume and yield. On a per passenger basis, third-party ancillary revenue was up more than 7% year over year and revenue from this business represented 35% of our pre-tax income. Las Vegas continues to be strong, but we are also seeing significant improvements in hotel and transportation sales in other markets.
"We expect our emphasis on higher margin vacation packages by offering a discount when air is bundled with hotel, and our new low price pledge, where we give a customer free round trip airfare if they can find a lower priced air-hotel package, will continue to drive more volume and profit," concluded Levy.
(a) includes credit card fees and travel agency commissions

"EBITDA" represents earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a calculation based on generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating income as indicators of our financial performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA is included as a supplemental disclosure because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance. Further, EBITDA is a well-recognized performance measurement that is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in comparing the operating performance of companies. We believe EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to our competitors because its calculation generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which items may vary between periods and for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. The following represents the reconciliation of EBITDA to net income for the periods indicated below.
The SEC has adopted rules (Regulation G) regulating the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Because of our use of the non-GAAP financial measure EBITDA to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Regulation G requires us to include in this press release a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income, and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP measure.  Our utilization of a non-GAAP measurement is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is not a GAAP measurement and our use of it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies in the airline industry. The reconciliations to GAAP measures follow.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
ALLEGIANT TRAVEL COMPANY
Las Vegas, Nev., January 31, 2011 /PRNewswire/  Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ: ALGT) today reported the following financial results for the 4th quarter 2010 as well as full year 2010 and comparisons to prior year equivalents:
We have concluded another very successful year, stated Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., Chairman and CEO of Allegiant Travel Company.  Our 4 quarter results represented the 32 consecutive quarter and eight straight years of profits.  Our $105M operating profit translated into $66M of net income and just short of $140M of EBITDA for the year.  4 quarter results generated a 13% operating margin, lower than our goal of 20%.  The substantial increase in jet fuel prices which peaked during the last two weeks of the quarter weighed o n the quarter's results.  In three months our scheduled service cost per gallon increased almost 11% or $.25 to $2.61.  If we had maintained our 3 quarter unit fuel cost, our operating margin would have approached 17%.  In spite of this, we were able to grow earnings per share by 23% compared to last years 4 quarter.
th
nd
th
rd
th
On the revenue front, we had reasonable increases.  Our total RASM in the 4 quarter, including ancillary products, increased 9.2% year over year while sequentially total RASM was up 12%.  Our scheduled service selling fare sequentially was up 16.6% in the 4 quarter versus the 3 quarter, a healthy increase.  Our combined scheduled service average fare of almost $117, exceeded only by our 3 quarter 2008 combined fare, was a necessary increase given the pressure from e nergy costs.
th
th
rd
rd
We have recently added several individuals to our senior management team, including new leaders in our flight operations and station operations areas as well as the creation of a new Chief Information Officer position.   We are excited to be able to attract highly capable leaders who will help us manage the business as it becomes larger and more complex.  Strengthening our foundation is a key part of our 2011 Plan and bringing on new leadership in certain areas of the business is a very important part of that effort.
Lastly, I want to thank our team members for their efforts in producing another excellent year.  Their efforts everyday delivering our customers safely, reliably and on-time are critical to our success, concluded Gallagher.
 
 
 
 
 
*Total system includes scheduled service, fixed-fee contract and non-revenue flying
Andrew C. Levy, President of Allegiant Travel Company, stated, We are very pleased with the improvement in our revenue metrics.  Our average fare, air-related and third party ancillaries all increased by more than 7% even with a 14% increase in capacity.
The revenue strength we experienced during the 4 quarter has continued into 2011 and while we are pleased with our revenue performance, we are wary of the accelerating climb in jet fuel prices we have seen in the last six weeks.  Our capacity plan for the 1 half of 2011 had already reflected a slowing growth rate, but we have now reduced our growth even further, particularly for the 2 quarter.  We now expect 2 quarter scheduled capacity to range from flat to up 4% year over y ear.
th
st
nd
nd
As we slow our growth rate, we will experience an increase in unit costs due in large part to lower fleet utilization, but less capacity gives us the opportunity to increase fares and attempt to pass on the higher costs of fuel to our customers.  In addition to added cost pressure due to our decision to lower utilization, we are projecting a substantial increase in engine maintenance for the first half of the year due to several planned engine overhaul events.
Our increased emphasis on our third party business continues to pay dividends.  During the 4 quarter, gross revenues from third party products increased 10%, but net revenues were up by 24% reflecting improved profitability.  Full year gross revenues approached $90 million, an increase of 22%, while net revenues increased by 24% to $24.4 million.  Our third party business continues to be an important area of focus for the company and we expect to maintain momentum with our recent advertising campaign emphasizing the value of bundled packages, concluded Levy.
th
(a) includes credit card fees and travel agency commissions

Our unrestricted cash at the end of the 2010 was $150 million which was down from $231 million at the beginning of the year.  Capital expenditures of $98.5 million for the year were lower than expected as the purchases of several part out MD-80s and one 757 moved to the 1 quarter of 2011.  We also paid down over $31 million in debt and capital lease obligations, while raising $14 million of debt on our two owned 757 aircraft.  Finally, during 2010 we returned over $68 million to shareholders through a $14.9 million special dividend and re-purchases of almost $53 million of the companys shares.  We currently have $46 million remaining under our share repurchase authority.

Item 8.01                      Other Events.
 
Allegiant Travel Company (the Company), expects its 2011 engine repair and overhaul expense to be approximately $20 to $25 million.  This compares to approximately $5 million in 2010.  The increased number is based on a decision to overhaul a greater number of engines during 2011 instead of the Companys prior practice of relying more on buying engines to replace engines in need of repair. Under the Companys current accounting method, the entire cost of engine overhauls is expensed when incurred and the timing of engine overhaul events can result in uneven expense recognition from quarter to quarter or year to year.
 
The Company is considering a change to its method of accounting for heavy maintenance activities to the built-in overhaul method which the Company believes to be more consistent with its operations. The Company has asked for SEC approval to make this change. Until approved by the SEC and reflected in the Companys financial statements, the Company will not provide information as to the effect of this possible accounting method change.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Las Vegas, Nev., April 28, 2011 /PRNewswire/  Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ: ALGT) today reported the following financial results for the 1 quarter 2011 and comparisons to prior year equivalents:
st
*Total system includes scheduled service, fixed-fee contract and non-revenue flying
We are very proud to report our 33 consecutive profitable quarter, stated Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., Chairman and CEO of Allegiant Travel Company.  I especially want to thank our team members for their efforts.  Their everyday efforts delivering our customers safely and reliably is critical to our continued success.
rd
Our 14.1% pre-tax margin is the 10 consecutive quarter in which we have achieved double digits.  We are especially pleased about these results in light of the rapid increase in fuel prices we experienced during the quarter, in particular during the month of March, typically our most profitable month of the year.
th
Our strong results are principally due to a 13.3% increase in scheduled service passenger RASM (PRASM) and an 11.4% increase in total scheduled service RASM (TRASM) compared with 1 quarter 2010.  We believe our unit revenue gains are due to a stronger demand environment, changes in our pricing strategy and tactics, and our aggressive management of capacity in our network.  During the quarter, our scheduled service ASM growth was only 2.7%, our slowest pace of year over year growth since the 3 and 4 quarters of 2008.
st
rd
th

Our current capacity plans remain very constrained, all in an effort to manage through this period of rapid fuel price escalation.  Once we believe fuel price increases begin to moderate, we expect to return our rate of growth to our historic norms, concluded Gallagher.
Andrew C. Levy, President of Allegiant Travel Company, stated, Our strategy of constraining capacity to respond to sharply rising jet fuel prices enabled us to offset most of the 14% increase in our average system jet fuel cost from the 4 quarter 2010 to the 1 quarter of 2011.  We expect to continue to report substantial year over year unit revenue increases for the next few months.  April PRASM is expected to increase between 22% and 24% and we expect a similar increase for the entire 2 quarter of 2011.
th
st
nd
 
 
The total fare of $125 per passenger is the highest we have ever recorded, due mostly to a 9.3% increase in average air fare, but also due to a 33% increase in third party ancillary revenue per passenger.  The improvement in net ancillary revenue was achieved through margin improvement and increased sales of hotel and transportation products, concluded Levy.
(a) includes credit card fees and travel agency commissions
Scott Sheldon, SVP and CFO of Allegiant Travel Company, stated, Our CASM ex-fuel increased by 9.2% during the 1 quarter, in part due to a 5.9% reduction in aircraft utilization and a 1% decline in average stage length.  We project an 8% decline in aircraft utilization for the 2 quarter which will again put upward pressure on our CASM ex-fuel which is expected to increase by 23% to 25% in the 2 quarter.  We expect our full year 2011 CASM ex-fuel to increase between 10% and 12%.
st
nd
nd
 
Apart from lower fleet utilization, we will see notable increases in salary and benefits and maintenance and repairs during the 2 quarter 2011.  Our pilot compensation agreement which took effect in May 2010 is driving the majority of the increase in salary and benefits, but the large year over year increases should start to moderate after this coming quarter once the agreement reaches its anniversary date in May.
nd
The projected increase in maintenance and repairs expense is due to a change in our MD-80 engine maintenance strategy.  In recent years, we overhauled very few of our engines and instead replaced most engines when needing repair with engines acquired in the secondary market.  This approach resulted in lower operating expenses but higher capital expenditures.
In late 2010, we decided to alter our approach and now expect to manage our engines through a combination of performing service overhauls on some units and purchasing engines to replace others.  We expect to recognize expenses of between $20 and $25 million in 2011 for the overhaul or repair of 30  35 MD-80 engines.  We had initially planned to recognize the majority of these expenses during the first two quarters of 2011, but now expect most of these expenses to be recognized during the 2 and 3 quarters due to delays in the execution of our new engine overhaul services agreement.  As a result, we expect maintenance and repairs expense per aircraft per month to be between $140,000 and $150,000 during the 2 quarter and between $135,000 and $145,000 during the 3 quarter.  These are substantially higher than historical norms, but we believe this increase is largely non-recurring.
nd
rd
nd
rd
 
2
 
Most importantly, the cash utilized in support of our MD-80 engine program  whether operating expenses or capital expenditures  was fairly consistent in 2009 and 2010 and we expect it to return to these levels in 2012 and beyond, adjusted for growth in fleet size.  Please see the table below for more detailed information on this area.
Our unrestricted cash (including short term investments) at the end of the 1 quarter 2011 was $305 million which was up from $150 million at the end of 2010.  We spent $40 million in capital expenditures which included the purchase of two 757 aircraft.  In March, we were successful in executing on a $125 million term loan.  Some of the highlights of this transaction were:
st
In addition, we raised $7 million of debt on one 757 aircraft.  We also made approximately $16.2 million in principal payments on debt.  Finally, we still have $46 million remaining under our share repurchase authority, concluded Sheldon.

At this time, Allegiant Travel Company provides the following guidance to investors, subject to revision.
CASM ex fuel  cost per available seat mile excluding fuel expense

Important risk factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements generally may be found in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov. These risk factors include, without limitation, the effect of the economic downturn on leisure travel, increases in fuel prices, terrorist attacks, risks inherent to airlines, demand for air services to our leisure destinations from the markets served by us, our ability to implement our growth strategy, unionization efforts, our dependence on our leisure destination markets, our ability to add, renew or replace gate leases, our competitive environment, problems with our aircraft, dependence on fixed fee customers, our reliance on our automated systems, economic and other conditions in markets in which we operate, aging aircraft and other governmental regulation, increases in maintenance costs and cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results.

(1) The Company's unvested restricted stock awards are considered participating securities as they receive non-forfeitable rights to cash dividends at the same rate as common stock.  The Basic and Diluted earnings per share for the periods presented reflect the two-class method mandated by accounting guidance for the calculation of earnings per share.  The two-class method adjusts both the net income and shares used in the calculation.  Application of the two-class method did not have a significant impact on the Basic and Diluted earnings per share for the periods presented.

"EBITDA" represents earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a calculation based on generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating income as indicators of our financial performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA is included as a supplemental disclosure because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance. Further, EBITDA is a well-recognized performance measurement that is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in comparing the operating performance of companies. We believe EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to our competitors because its calculation generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which items may vary between periods and for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. The following represents the reconciliation of EBITDA to net income for the periods indicated below.
The SEC has adopted rules (Regulation G) regulating the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Because of our use of the non-GAAP financial measure EBITDA to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Regulation G requires us to include in this press release a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income, and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP measure.  Our utilization of a non-GAAP measurement is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is not a GAAP measurement and our use of it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies in the airline industry. The reconciliations to GAAP measures follow.

Exhibit 99.1
Las Vegas, Nev., August 1, 2011 /GLOBE NEWSWIRE/  Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ: ALGT) today reported the following financial results for the 2 quarter 2011 and comparisons to prior year equivalents:
nd
*Total system includes scheduled service, fixed-fee contract and non-revenue flying
We are very proud to report our 34 consecutive profitable quarter, stated Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., Chairman and CEO of Allegiant Travel Company.  Id like to thank our Team Members for their great efforts and contributions to another successful quarter.
th
Revenues have been very strong.  Scheduled service revenues were up almost 24% versus 2 quarter 2010 despite a reduction in capacity.  The $19 increase in revenue per passenger more than offset the $15 per passenger increase in fuel cost during the quarter.
nd
We are also very excited about the addition of the first 757 to our operating certificate, which occurred on July 1.  We recently began operating this 217 seat aircraft on two of our Las Vegas routes, McAllen, Texas and Rockford, Illinois and have been receiving excellent feedback from our customers.  Having the additional seats during the peak summer travel period is proving to be quite valuable.  We are now working on preparing our application to the FAA for obtaining the requisite ETOPS approvals we need in order to commence Hawaii flights which we hope to be able to begin next summer.
The introduction of the 757, our Hawaii expansion and the previously announced MD-80 seat expansion projects are all important to the company and we are excited to see progress on all fronts.  Our Team Members have been working diligently to complete these product additions as well as continue to provide our customers with low cost access to our world class destinations, concluded Gallagher.

Andrew C. Levy, President of Allegiant Travel Company, stated, We are very pleased with our revenue performance during the 2 quarter.  We produced the highest total fare in our companys history, driven by increases in the base air fare, and both air-related and third party ancillary revenues.  A 2.6% reduction in capacity was a key factor enabling this strong revenue performance.  We have again proven we can thrive during periods of high fuel price volatility if we are prudent in how we allocate our capacity.
nd
Strength in revenue has continued as we enter this 3 quarter, again aided by a tight capacity plan.  Capacity this quarter will be lower as compared with the 3 quarter of 2010 and we again expect to post substantial increases in unit revenues as more fully described in the guidance section later in the release.
rd
rd
Our current plan for the 4 quarter shows slight growth in capacity, mostly attributable to having a full quarter flying our first 757 as well as a small contribution from the presence of some re-configured MD-80 aircraft with 166 seats in the operating fleet.
th
Finally, we again experienced strong growth in our third party ancillary revenue primarily resulting from greater volume and yield in hotel room sales.  Room nights grew over 12% versus the 2 quarter last year, with almost half of the increase generated away from our traditionally strong Las Vegas market.  Growth in the third party segment is a high priority and we continue to make investments in management and technology to further that goal, concluded Levy.
nd
(a) includes credit card fees and travel agency commissions
Scott Sheldon, SVP and CFO of Allegiant Travel Company, stated, During the 2 quarter, we experienced a 27% increase in unit costs  cost per passenger was $115.24 compared with $90.96 in the 2 quarter 2010 - but the results were as projected.  Fuel costs per passenger were 37% higher, and non-fuel per passenger costs were up by 18% or slightly more than $9.
nd
nd
The increase in non-fuel unit costs was mostly due to reduced fleet utilization and $4.8 million of special items or $3.08 per passenger.  These expenses included 757 pre-operating costs, manual integrations, the retirement of one MD-87 and the write down and impairment charges related to our engine consignment program.  The increase in non-fuel per passenger costs would have been only $3.30 or 6.5% excluding these special items and if fleet utilization had remained unchanged on a year over year basis.
Apart from fuel, we experienced the most unit cost pressure in the maintenance area due to the execution of our engine overhaul and repair strategy as we have described in the past.  We continue to project expenses between $20 and $25 million in 2011 for the overhaul of 30 to 35 engines, but the majority of these expenditures will occur in the 3 and 4 quarters of this year.
rd
th
 
 
2
 
While our full year 2011 engine operating expense projection remains unchanged, we have increased our projection for total cash outlays.  We now expect to increase our capital expenditures to take advantage of current opportunities in the secondary engine market which will replenish our engine sparing levels and enable us to better manage the timing and costs associated with major engine overhaul events in the future.  Please see the table below for more detailed information on this area
Lastly, our unrestricted cash balance (including short term investments) grew slightly during the 2 quarter to $317 million, up $11 million from the end of the 1 quarter.  During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 34,300 shares for $1.6 million and we currently have $44.9 million in remaining board authorized authority, concluded Sheldon.

At this time, Allegiant Travel Company provides the following guidance to investors, subject to revision.
CASM ex fuel  cost per available seat mile excluding fuel expense
Allegiant Travel Company will host a conference call with analysts at 4:30 East Coast time today, August 1, 2011, to discuss its 2 quarter 2011 financial results. A live broadcast of the conference call will be available via the Companys Investor Relations website homepage at http://ir.allegiant.com.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Las Vegas, Nev., October 26, 2011 /GLOBE NEWSWIRE/  Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ: ALGT) today reported the following financial results for the 3 quarter 2011 and comparisons to prior year equivalents:
rd
*Total system includes scheduled service, fixed-fee contract and non-revenue flying
We are very proud to report our 35 consecutive profitable quarter, stated Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., Chairman and CEO of Allegiant Travel Company.  Id like to thank our Team Members for their great efforts and contributions to another successful quarter.
th
Revenues continue to perform nicely.  Most of the meaningful revenue metrics during the third quarter increased 15% or more year over year, another strong performance.  We are continuing our focus on near term projects.  We now have two 166 seat MD-80 aircraft in service on our Bellingham routes, and we are beginning to sell into the extra seats.
Our 757 activity was successful during the quarter as well.  We began operations with our initial 757 aircraft in late July and operated it on two routes to and from Las Vegas.  For a nominal amount of additional fuel burn, we are generating 67 additional profit potential seats. These additional seats on our peak days, in the proper markets, are expected to contribute significant incremental profit.
Lastly we are making good progress on the revamp of our automation platform.  Current plans call for our new platform to be available in time for the January 24 DOT cutover date.  It will be the first enhancement of many to come, with the ultimate objective of creating an OTA style system that will enhance our efforts to sell additional hotel overnights and associated packages, concluded Gallagher.
th

Andrew C. Levy, President of Allegiant Travel Company, stated, We are very pleased in our ability to continuously offset increases in fuel prices with higher fares.  Our total fare of $120.63 is a record high for the 3 quarter, which is our seasonally weakest time of the year.  It is the fourth consecutive quarter in which we have posted record fares for the respective quarter.
rd
Gains in the base airfare, air-related ancillary, third party ancillary and load factor all contributed to a 19.5% increase in TRASM.  The unit revenue comparables become more difficult as the year progresses, but October should be another strong month with a projected year over year gain in PRASM between 16 and 18% despite 5% capacity growth.  We expect 4 quarter PRASM to increase between 11 and 13% on a year over year basis despite capacity growth of between 5 and 9%.
th
Finally, we are again pleased with the growth in third party ancillary revenue.  As noted below, we saw growth in both hotel room nights and rental car days which helped to account for a 17.5% increase in ancillary revenue per passenger for the quarter, concluded Levy.
(a) includes credit card fees and travel agency commissions
Scott Sheldon, SVP and CFO of Allegiant Travel Company, stated, During the quarter our cost per passenger ex-fuel increased 9.7% to $57.42.  The increase in ex-fuel costs was due in part to a 6.5% reduction in aircraft utilization and a 2.3% decline in average stage length.  As was the case in the 2 quarter, we once again restricted capacity in the 3 quarter in an effort to offset higher fuel which put additional pressure on our unit costs.
nd
rd
Our increase in non-fuel costs was also due to the continued execution of our engine overhaul strategy, credit card processing fees related to a substantial increase in scheduled revenue and depreciation and amortization related to our four operating 757 aircraft, three of which are leased to other carriers.
 
2
 
Lastly, our unrestricted cash balance (including investments in marketable securities) decreased slightly during the 3 quarter to $303 million, down $14 million from the end of the 2nd quarter.  During the quarter we raised $7 million of debt secured by one 757 aircraft purchased during the first quarter.  In addition we spent $19 million in cap ex bringing our year to date total to $69 million, concluded Sheldon.
rd
*-Unrestricted cash includes investments in marketable securities
At this time, Allegiant Travel Company provides the following guidance to investors, subject to revision.
 
Guidance, subject to revision

Allegiant Travel Company will host a conference call with analysts at 4:30 East Coast time today, October 26, 2011, to discuss its 3 quarter 2011 financial results. A live broadcast of the conference call will be available via the Companys Investor Relations website homepage at .

Detailed financial information follows:

(1) The Company's unvested restricted stock awards are considered participating securities as they receive non-forfeitable rights to cash dividends at the same rate as common stock.  The Basic and Diluted earnings per share for the periods presented reflect the two-class method mandated by accounting guidance for the calculation of earnings per share.  The two-class method adjusts both the net income and shares used in the calculation.  Application of the two-class method did not have a significant impact on the Basic and Diluted earnings per share for the periods presented.

"EBITDA" represents earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a calculation based on generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating income as indicators of our financial performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA is included as a supplemental disclosure because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance. Further, EBITDA is a well-recognized performance measurement that is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in comparing the operating performance of companies. We believe EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to our competitors because its calculation generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which items may vary between periods and for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. The following represents the reconciliation of EBITDA to net income for the periods indicated below.
The SEC has adopted rules (Regulation G) regulating the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Because of our use of the non-GAAP financial measure EBITDA to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Regulation G requires us to include in this press release a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income, and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP measure.  Our utilization of a non-GAAP measurement is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is not a GAAP measurement and our use of it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies in the airline industry. The reconciliations to GAAP measures follow.

Explanatory Note
Allegiant Travel Company  (the Company) is filing this Amendment No. 1 (this Amendment), on Form 8-K/A, to the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 15, 2011 (the Original Report) to disclose the Companys decision in light of the voting results of the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 14, 2011 (the Annual Meeting) as to how frequently the Company will include in its proxy statement an advisory stockholder vote on the compensation of named executive officers, as required by Item 5.07(d) of Form 8-K. The Company reported the voting results of the Annual Meeting in the Original Report.
This Amendment should be read in conjunction with the Original Report. Except for the matters disclosed below, this Amendment does not amend the Original Report in any way and does not modify or update any other disclosures contained in the Original Report.
This Form 8-K/A also includes new disclosures under Item 7.01 of Form 8-K.
Section 5         Corporate Governance and Management
Item 5.07         Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
As previously reported in the Original Report, in an advisory vote on the frequency of holding advisory votes on the compensation of the Companys named executive officers held at the Annual Meeting, 8,521,919 shares voted for one year, 21,616 shares voted for two years, 7,333,891 shares voted for three years, 3,482 shares abstained and there were 739,336 broker non-votes. The Company has considered the outcome of this advisory vote. Although a slight majority of the votes of the Companys stockholders were cast at the Annual Meeting in favor of holding an annual, non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation, more than 46% of the votes cast on the non-binding advisory say on pay frequency proposal were voted in favor of holding the non-binding advisory say on pay vote every three years. Further, the Board considered:
The advantage of a longer term perspective that a triennial vote would bring, in light of the significant equity component of the Companys compensation program with vesting over three or more years, the value of which is directly linked to share performance. Further, a vote every three years provides a longer term compensation history and business performance track record against which to measure management's strategic long-term business decisions and more frequent votes may focus undue attention on the particular year being reported as opposed to the longer term focus the Company is seeking to achieve through its compensation policies..
The strong support for the Company's compensation program evidenced by the stockholders 2011 advisory say on pay vote on compensation in which approximately 75% of the shares voting on the proposal approved the executive compensation reflected in the Companys 2011 proxy statement.
 
-2-
 
The Boards recommendation contained in the proxy statement for the Companys 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders that the advisory say on pay vote be held every three years.
While the Company believes the views of its stockholders are important, in light of all of the above factors, the Board has decided to conduct future stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation every three years until the next required say on pay frequency vote. As such, the next say on pay advisory vote will be held at the Companys Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in 2014 unless the Board of Directors determines that a different frequency for such votes is in the best interests of the Companys stockholders or until the next advisory say on pay frequency vote is held. The next non-binding advisory say on pay frequency vote will be held no later than the Companys Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in 2017.

Exhibit 99.1
 
NEWS RELEASE
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: February 1, 2012
() today reported the following financial results for the 4 quarter and full year 2011 as well as comparisons to prior year equivalents:
LAS VEGAS
(GLOBE NEWSWIRE)
Allegiant Travel Company
NASDAQ: ALGT
th
*Total system includes scheduled service, fixed-fee contract and non-revenue flying
We are very proud to report our 36 consecutive profitable quarter, stated Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., Chairman and CEO of Allegiant Travel Company.  Id like to thank our Team Members for their great efforts and contributions to another successful quarter and year.
th
We had an excellent December and fourth quarter.  In fourth quarter 2011, revenues were up 20 percent or $31.9 million on just a 9.3 percent increase in system capacity.  2011 was another momentous year for us, our fifth year in a row with double digit operating margins. While fuel put a dent in the operating results for the year, we made excellent progress in our ongoing projects including introduction of our 757 aircraft, beginning our 166 seat conversion and automation upgrades.
 
 
 
 
Allegiant Q4 and Full Year Earnings
As part of our growth for 2012, we have announced eight new routes during the past 30 days and our new base in Oakland.  Soon we will be in 76 cities, including 11 leisure destinations, with 178 routes.  We currently have 53 aircraft in revenue service including one 757. We are expecting to have at least 16 166 seat MD-80 aircraft in service by the end of first quarter 2012, and we are on track with our forecast for ETOPS certification later this year, which will allow us to begin our Hawaii service, concluded Gallagher.
Andrew C. Levy, President of Allegiant Travel Company, stated, We had another successful quarter of offsetting higher fuel costs.  In fourth quarter 2011, fuel expense per passenger increased almost $9 versus 2010, but we were able to successfully raise our average scheduled fare by $10. This increase comes despite an eight percent growth in available seat miles as compared to fourth quarter 2010.  We have worked very hard this year to adapt our pricing and scheduling to higher fuel prices and the results have been strong.
We are carrying good momentum into 2012.  Our January PRASM is projected to increase between nine and eleven percent, and we are expecting first quarter 2012 PRASM to be up between one and three percent on a year over year basis.
Finally, we continue to see strength in our third party ancillary business.  Third party ancillary net revenue increased 23 percent in both the fourth quarter of 2011 and the full year.  As we have said in the past, third party products will continue to be an area of focus, and we expect to see strong growth continue into 2012, concluded Levy.
(a) includes credit card fees and travel agency commissions
Scott Sheldon, SVP and CFO of Allegiant Travel Company, stated, Fuel, maintenance and depreciation expense continued to place pressure on our cost structure during the fourth quarter of 2011. Consistent with prior quarters, fuel expense continued to be the largest contributor to the decrease in operating income. Our fuel cost per passenger increased nearly $9, or 19.7 percent, to $54 during the quarter.
Engine overhaul and repairs expense was the largest driver in our 6.3 percent increase in non-fuel per passenger costs during the quarter. In 2011, we invested heavily in our engine overhauls in an effort to improve reliability. The fourth quarter marked the high point both in the number of engines overhauled and in expense recognized at $9 million.  For the full year, engine overhaul and repairs expense totaled $19 million (as projected), substantially higher than the $5 million in 2010.  In 2012, engine overhaul and repairs expense is expected to diminish now that 50 percent of our engine pool has fewer than 1,000 cycles since overhaul as compared with only 11 percent in January of 2011.
 
 
 
 
 
Allegiant Q4 and Full Year Earnings
Excluding engine overhaul and repair expense and depreciation expense related to three leased 757 aircraft not producing passengers or ASMs, all other non-fuel costs per ASM were down 2.2 percent for the quarter.  As we look forward to first quarter 2012, we expect CASM ex fuel to be up between zero to two percent as compared to the first quarter of 2011.
During our 166 seat project, we will consistently have three or four aircraft out of scheduled service being reconfigured.  The total fleet count, provided below, includes aircraft that are in the process of being upgraded to 166 seats and therefore are unavailable for flight operations.
Lastly, we ended the year with unrestricted cash of nearly $320 million, up $16 million from the end of the third quarter and $169 million from the end of 2010.  During the year we paid down over $21 million in debt, bringing our total debt balance to $146 million at the end of 2011.  Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $18 million and $87 million on a full year basis.  Although we anticipated closing on our fifth and sixth 757 aircraft during fourth quarter 2011, we now expect these aircraft to be acquired in first quarter 2012.  As such, 2012 cap ex is expected to be in the range of $105 and $115 million, slightly higher than forecasted last quarter, concluded Sheldon.
*-Unrestricted cash includes investments in marketable securities
At this time, Allegiant Travel Company provides the following guidance to investors, subject to revision.

Allegiant Q4 and Full Year Earnings
"EBITDA" represents earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a calculation based on generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating income as indicators of our financial performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA is included as a supplemental disclosure because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance. Further, EBITDA is a well-recognized performance measurement that is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in comparing the operating performance of companies. We believe EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to our competitors because its calculation generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which items may vary between periods and for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. The following represents the reconciliation of EBITDA to net income for the periods indicated below.
The SEC has adopted rules (Regulation G) regulating the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Because of our use of the non-GAAP financial measure EBITDA to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Regulation G requires us to include in this press release a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income, and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP measure.  Our utilization of a non-GAAP measurement is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is not a GAAP measurement and our use of it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies in the airline and travel industry. The reconciliations to GAAP measures follow.

(1) The Company's unvested restricted stock awards are considered participating securities as they receive non-forfeitable rights to cash dividends at the same rate as common stock.  The Basic and Diluted earnings per share for the periods presented reflect the two-class method mandated by accounting guidance for the calculation of earnings per share.  The two-class method adjusts both the net income and shares used in the calculation.  Application of the two-class method did not have a significant impact on the Basic and Diluted earnings per share for the periods presented.

On  Thursday, May 17, 2012, Jude Bricker, Senior Vice President of Planning of Allegiant Travel Company (the Company) suggested at the Bank of America Global Transportation Conference that the year over year change in total scheduled service revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) would be closer to zero for the quarter ending June 30, 2012.  What he intended to say was that TRASM would likely outperform scheduled service passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) for the quarter. That is, the Company expects that the percentage decrease for TRASM for the quarter ending June 30, 2012 will be less than the percentage decrease expected for PRASM.  The Company did not provide, and is not providing, specific TRASM guidance for the second quarter of 2012.

Detailed financial information follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1) The Company's unvested restricted stock awards are considered participating securities as they receive non-forfeitable rights to cash dividends at the same rate as common stock.  The Basic and Diluted earnings per share for the periods presented reflect the two-class method mandated by accounting guidance for the calculation of earnings per share.  The two-class method adjusts both the net income and shares used in the calculation.  Application of the two-class method did not have a significant impact on the Basic and Diluted earnings per share for the periods presented.

* Except load factor and percent of sales through website, which is percentage point change.

Allegiant Travel Company
"EBITDA" represents earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a calculation based on generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating income as indicators of our financial performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA is included as a supplemental disclosure because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance. Further, EBITDA is a well-recognized performance measurement that is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in comparing the operating performance of companies. We believe EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to our competitors because its calculation generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which items may vary between periods and for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. The following represents the reconciliation of EBITDA to net income for the periods indicated below.
The SEC has adopted rules (Regulation G) regulating the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Because of our use of the non-GAAP financial measure EBITDA to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Regulation G requires us to include in this press release a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income, and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP measure.  Our utilization of a non-GAAP measurement is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is not a GAAP measurement and our use of it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies in the airline and travel industry. The reconciliations to GAAP net income follow.

The third quarter is typically our weakest quarter of the year, and yet we were able to produce the highest third quarter earnings per share in the company's history.

Non-GAAP Presentations
Quarters Ended September 30, 2012 and 2011
(Unaudited)
 
"EBITDA" represents earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a calculation based on generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating income as indicators of our financial performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA is included as a supplemental disclosure because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance. Further, EBITDA is a well-recognized performance measurement that is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in comparing the operating performance of companies. We believe EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to our competitors because its calculation generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which items may vary between periods and for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. The following represents the reconciliation of EBITDA to net income for the periods indicated below.
 
The SEC has adopted rules (Regulation G) regulating the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Because of our use of the non-GAAP financial measure EBITDA to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Regulation G requires us to include in this press release a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income, and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP measure.  Our utilization of a non-GAAP measurement is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is not a GAAP measurement and our use of it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies in the airline and travel industry. The reconciliations to GAAP net income follow.

EXHIBIT INDEX
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
Dear Shareholder:
 
Your Board of Directors recently declared a special dividend of $2 per share to shareholders of record on November 30 this year.
th
The company has continued to perform very well in recent years, particularly during 2012. Through the first three quarters of 2012, we have generated $686 million of revenue, a pre-tax margin of almost 15% and net income of almost $64 million or $3.31 per fully diluted share. Our balance sheet remains very strong - $357 million in unrestricted cash and debt of $157 million.
Since our last special dividend in mid-2010, the companys top line will have grown almost 40% by the end of 2012 while earnings should be up 30%.   We have continued to refine our small city model and maintain our industry leading margins at the same time.  We have had 39 quarters in a row of profitability and are working on our 40, I am happy to say.
th
We are proud to be one of the most profitable companies in our space.  Just as the first special dividend was a return of your capital in 2010, so is this 2012 payment.  We are focused on seeing all of our interest groups succeed, our customers, our team members and, of course, our shareholders.
We are in the enviable position of having sufficient capital to grow at a comfortable pace and take advantage of our tremendous growth prospects, but also to return capital to shareholders. In addition to this special dividend, we have also been re-purchasing stock under our previously authorized share re-purchase program. As of December 7, 2012, we have approximately $42.3 million of remaining authority for future share re-purchases.
Special dividends in this space are unusual. The current conditions and our performance convinced the board that this dividend was appropriate. Your Board of Directors will continue to evaluate this and other methods for returning excess capital to our shareholders in the future.
In the meantime, thank you for your continued confidence in Allegiant.  We will continue to strive for excellence in our performance.  Since 2002, we have been a profitable, growing company  39 quarters in a row.  We intend to continue this performance.
All the best,
Maurice J. Gallagher
Chairman of the Board and
Chief Executive Officer

(1) The Company's unvested restricted stock awards are considered participating securities as they receive non-forfeitable rights to cash dividends at the same rate as common stock.  The Basic and Diluted earnings per share for the periods presented reflect the two-class method mandated by accounting guidance for the calculation of earnings per share.  The two-class method adjusts both the net income and shares used in the calculation.  Application of the two-class method did not have a significant impact on the Basic and Diluted earnings per share for the periods presented.

"EBITDA" represents earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a calculation based on generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating income as indicators of our financial performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA is included as a supplemental disclosure because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance. Further, EBITDA is a well-recognized performance measurement that is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in comparing the operating performance of companies. We believe EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to our competitors because its calculation generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which items may vary between periods and for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. The following represents the reconciliation of EBITDA to net income for the periods indicated below.
The SEC has adopted rules (Regulation G) regulating the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Because of our use of the non-GAAP financial measure EBITDA to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Regulation G requires us to include in this press release a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income, and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP measure.  Our utilization of a non-GAAP measurement is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is not a GAAP measurement and our use of it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies in the airline and travel industry. The reconciliations to GAAP net income follow.

Non-GAAP Presentations
Three Months Ended March 31, 2013 and 2012
(Unaudited)
 
"EBITDA" represents earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a calculation based on generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating income as indicators of our financial performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA is included as a supplemental disclosure because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance. Further, EBITDA is a well-recognized performance measurement that is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in comparing the operating performance of companies. We believe EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to our competitors because its calculation generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which items may vary between periods and for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. The following represents the reconciliation of EBITDA to net income for the periods indicated below.
 
The SEC has adopted rules (Regulation G) regulating the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Because of our use of the non-GAAP financial measure EBITDA to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Regulation G requires us to include in this press release a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income, and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP measure.  Our utilization of a non-GAAP measurement is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is not a GAAP measurement and our use of it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies in the airline and travel industry. The reconciliations to GAAP net income follow.
