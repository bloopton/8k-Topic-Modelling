ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS Acquisition of Rocky Mountain Holdings, L.L.C. - ---------------------------------------------- On October 16, 2002, Air Methods Corporation (the "Company") acquired 100% of the membership interest of Rocky Mountain Holdings, L.L.C. ("RMH"), a Delaware limited liability company, from Rocky Mountain Holdings, Inc. and AMC Helicopters, Inc. The $28 million cash purchase price for RMH was increased to $33.6 million to reflect increases in net equity since December 31, 2001, which also decreased RMH's indebtedness at closing. RMH's long-term debt and outstanding balances on RMH's line of credit totaled $36.2 million as of September 30, 2002. Except for approximately $1.6 million of RMH debt that was repaid in connection with the acquisition, the long-term debt remains outstanding, either as debt of RMH or as debt assumed or replaced by the Company. The $5 million outstanding balance on the RMH line of credit was rolled into the new revolving credit facility described below. The purchase price is subject to changes in net equity from September 30, 2002, until the date of closing, to be determined by independent audit within 60 days of the closing date. The purchase price was negotiated by the Company and the sellers, and includes an earn-out provision under which the sellers may receive up to $2.6 million of additional consideration over the next nine years based on actual collections against certain receivables. The Company incurred costs and fees of approximately $1 million in connection with the acquisition, including legal fees of Company counsel and a fee of $750,000 paid to Americas Partners for its services in connection with the acquisition. Ralph Bernstein and Morad Tahbaz, directors of the Company, are partners of Americas Partners. In addition, the Company incurred debt origination fees and expenses of approximately $2.6 million, including fees paid to CIBC World Markets Corp. for investment banking services in arranging the financing for the acquisition and legal fees paid to counsel for the lenders. RMH pioneered the first hospital-based air medical service program over thirty years ago and currently provides air medical transport services throughout the United States under both the community-based and hospital-based service delivery models utilizing a fleet of over 80 helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. RMH also maintains a national dispatch and communications center in Omaha, Nebraska, and aircraft maintenance and overhaul operations at its Provo, Utah headquarters and in Greenville, South Carolina. The Company plans to continue all of RMH's operations and to retain the RMH bases, equipment and air medical transport service personnel. Certain of the RMH administrative functions are planned to be combined with those of the Company. For 2001, RMH had revenues and net income of $87.9 million and $2.6 million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, RMH had revenues and net income of $76.2 million and $5.5 million, respectively. RMH's assets at September 30, 2002 were $80.4 million. Financing the Acquisition - ------------------------- Subordinated Notes. The purchase price was financed in part through the issuance - ------------------ of $23 million in subordinated notes (the "Notes") to Prudential Capital Partners, L.P. and an affiliate of PCP ("PCP"). Each of the Company and its subsidiaries, RMH, Arch Air Medical Services and Mercy Air Service, is a direct obligor on the Notes and is fully responsible for their payment. The Notes are unsecured and provide for quarterly payment of interest only at 12% per annum, with all principal due October 16, 2007. Except as set forth below, the Notes may not be prepaid until July 1, 2004, and prepayments after July 1, 2004 will be at a declining premium. Up to 25% of the Notes outstanding at closing may be prepaid at any time without premium with the proceeds of an underwritten public equity offering providing net proceeds to the Company of at least $10 million or, if PCP has transferred at least 50% of its Warrants (described below), a private placement of Company equity securities. In addition, the Company may prepay the Notes held by PCP at par upon the occurrence of a Liquidity Event (generally, a sale of all of the Company's equity or assets) if PCP's "cash on cash" return has exceeded 2:1. The purchase agreement entered into in connection with the Note issuance (the "SPA") contains various covenants that limit, among other things, the Company's ability to: 1
* create liens; * prepay indebtedness (except in connection with refinancing of Aircraft Indebtedness); * make certain loans; * engage in transactions with affiliates on other than arms' length terms; * make any material change to the nature of the Company's business; * sell or discount receivables; * lease real property in excess of specified expenditure levels; * enter into a merger or consolidation; * sell assets; or * pay dividends. With certain exceptions, the Company may not permit the aggregate of (i) new indebtedness, plus (ii) the net present value of future lease payments under newly originated operating leases, plus (iii) Unfinanced Capital Expenditures (as defined) (collectively (i), (ii) and (iii) being referred to as "Capital Debt") to exceed $33 million per year in 2003 and 2004 and $38.5 million per year in 2005 and thereafter. The Company is also subject to a limitation on the amount it may expend in acquisitions without prior consent of the majority of the noteholders ($12.5 million in 2003, $20 million in 2004 and $30 million per year thereafter), which amount may be increased during 2004 and 2005 with 50% of the proceeds of a public equity offering by the Company. The SPA also contains covenants requiring the Company to maintain: * a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined) of not less than 1:1 for 2003 (increasing thereafter); * a total debt to EBITDA ratio of not more than 4.05:1.00 (increasing after 3/31/04); * a minimum net worth; * a senior debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.05:1.00 (decreasing after 3/31/04); and * a minimum EBITDA of $26.6 million (increasing after 1/1/04). Payment obligations under the Notes accelerate upon the occurrence of defined events of default, including the following: failure to pay principal or interest or to perform covenants included in the SPA, the senior credit facility or other indebtedness; events of insolvency or bankruptcy, judgments of $500,000 that are not paid or discharged timely; failure to file and keep effective a registration statement relating to the Warrants issued to PCP; and a Change of Control. A Change of Control occurs when (i) any person becomes the beneficial owner of 40% or more of the Company's stock, (ii) directors of the Company at October 16, 2002, or directors approved by them, cease to comprise a majority of the Company's board of directors, (iii) foreign persons in the aggregate own or control 20% or more of the Company's voting stock, or (iv) the Company or any subsidiary that holds an air carrier certificate ceases to be a citizen of the United States. If the Notes are prepaid prior to final maturity, a Yield Maintenance Payment is required that is designed to provide the holders with approximately the same amount of interest they would have received had the Notes been paid at maturity. The Company also issued transferable warrants ("Warrants") to PCP to purchase 443,224 shares of Air Methods Common Stock with an exercise price of at $.06 per share, exercisable through October 2008, and entered into a Stockholders' Agreement with PCP. Under the Stockholders' Agreement, the Company is required to file a registration statement by December 30, 2002 registering the common stock underlying the Warrants, to have such registration statement declared effective within 90 days after filing, and to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement continuously thereafter. Failure to satisfy any of these obligations will result in monetary penalties (beginning at $38,333 per month, increasing monthly) and can constitute an event of default under the SPA. 2
One representative of PCP is permitted to participate in all Company board meetings as an observer. If the Company issues equity securities in the future (other than in a public offering), any holder of unexercised Warrants is entitled to pre-emptive rights to participate in that offering to maintain the percentage ownership represented by the unexercised Warrants. Senior Credit Facility. To finance the remainder of the purchase price and - ------------------------ related closing costs and to provide working capital and letter of credit availability for the combined entities, Air Methods entered into a $35 million revolving credit facility with certain lenders, with PNC Bank, National Association (PNC) acting as agent. Borrowings under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of the Company's non-aircraft assets, including accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and general intangibles. Indebtedness under the credit facility will have a first priority claim to the assets pledged to secure it. The Company and its three subsidiaries are each a direct obligor on the credit facility. The facility matures October 16, 2006 but can be prepaid at any time, subject to payment of an early termination fee ranging from .25% to 2% if the termination occurs prior to October 16, 2004. Indebtedness under the credit facility will bear interest, at the Company's option, at either (i) the higher of the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or the prime rate as announced by PNC plus an applicable margin ranging from 0 to 0.75% or (ii) at a rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.75% to 3.00%. The applicable margin in each case is based upon the ratio of senior debt (as defined in the credit facility) to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facility) for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters. The amount of borrowing permitted under the credit facility is based on a borrowing base comprised of (i) 75% of accounts receivable from Medicare, Medicaid, insurance companies and community-based payors and 85% of other accounts receivable, and (ii) the lesser of (A) 60% of inventory valued at the lower of cost or market, (B) 85% of inventory valued at liquidation value, or (C) $15 million. Based on assets at the time of the closing, approximately $33.6 million was available under the credit facility, and borrowings under the credit facility at closing were approximately $16 million, leaving approximately $17.6 million of unused borrowing availability. The credit facility contains various covenants that limit, among other things, the Company's ability to: * create liens; * declare dividends; * make loans and investments; * enter into real property leases exceeding specified expenditure levels; * make any material change to the nature of the Company's business; * enter into any transaction with affiliates other than on arms' length terms; * prepay indebtedness, except in connection with refinancing Aircraft Indebtedness or, with respect to the Notes issued to PCP, with proceeds of equity issuances; * enter into a merger or consolidation; or * sell assets. The credit agreement also contains covenants requiring the Company to maintain: * a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.1:1.00 (increasing after 1/1/04); and * a minimum net worth. With certain exceptions the Company may not permit its Capital Debt to exceed $30 million per year in 2003 and 2004 and $35 million per year in 2005 and 2006. Under the credit facility the Company may not expend more than $10 million per year for acquisitions without prior consent of the majority of the member banks, and debt incurred in any acquisition must be less than twice the cash purchase price. No acquisition may occur without prior consent unless there is $10 million of undrawn availability under the credit facility. 3
Payment obligations under the credit facility accelerate upon the occurrence of defined events of default, including the following: failure to pay principal or interest, or to perform covenants, under the credit facility, the Notes or other indebtedness; events of insolvency or bankruptcy; judgments of $250,000 are not paid or discharged timely; failure to maintain the first priority status of liens under the credit facility; levy against a material portion of the Company's assets; default under the Notes; suspension of material governmental permits; interruption of operations at any Company facility that has a material adverse effect; and a Change of Control (which has the same definition in the credit facility as in the SPA). The descriptions of the Subordinated Notes and the Senior Credit Facility are summaries, and do not contain all of the exceptions and qualifications that may apply.

All defined terms used, but not otherwise defined, herein shall have their respective meanings set forth on Appendix A. ---------- RECITALS A. The Company is engaged in the business of providing emergency air medical transportation services in the United States (the "BUSINESS"), and owns and leases certain assets and properties which are used by or useful to the Company in the conduct of its Business. B. Buyer is also engaged in the business of providing emergency air medical transportation services in the United States. C. Buyer desires to purchase from the Sellers, and Sellers desire to sell to the Buyer, all of the issued and outstanding membership interests (the "INTERESTS") of the Company on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and substantially in accordance with that certain non-binding Letter of Intent, dated April 4, 2002, entered into by and among Buyer, the Company, and Sellers, as thereafter amended (the "LOI"), providing for such purchase and sale. AGREEMENT NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, terms and conditions set forth below, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows: ARTICLE I SALE AND PURCHASE OF CERTAIN ASSETS 1.1 Purchase and Sale (a) Agreement to Purchase and Sell. On the terms and subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement, each Seller agrees to sell, convey, assign, transfer, and deliver its respective Interests to Buyer, and Buyer agrees to purchase the Interests from Sellers, on the Closing Date, effective as of 11:59 p.m., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania time. (b) Payments to Sellers. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, (i) any and all payments to be made under this Agreement to the Sellers (including, without limitation, distributions under the Escrow
Agreement) shall be made to the Sellers, and (ii) any and all payments to be made under this Agreement by the Sellers shall be the several obligations of the Sellers, in each such case based on their respective ownership of 50% of the Interests. 1.2 Purchase Price (a) Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Interests (the "PURCHASE PRICE") will be the sum of: (i) twenty-eight million dollars ($28,000,000.00), (ii) the Members Equity Adjustment Amount, to be calculated and paid as specified in Sections 1.2(b)-(d); and (iii) the Contingent Consideration Payment, to be calculated and paid as specified in Section 1.4(b). (b) Certain Definitions. (i) "MEMBERS EQUITY ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT" (which may be a positive or negative number) will be equal to the amount determined by subtracting the Estimated Total Members Equity from the Closing Total Members Equity, subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 1.2(d) below. (ii) "PRELIMINARY MEMBERS EQUITY ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT" (which may be a positive or negative number) will be equal to the amount determined by subtracting the Estimated Total Members Equity from the Pre-Closing Total Members Equity. (iii) "TOTAL MEMBERS EQUITY" as of a given date shall be calculated in the same manner as on the audited balance sheet of the Company at December 31, 2001 (the "12/31/01 BALANCE SHEET"), other than with respect to the account for "accrued aircraft maintenance," which shall be calculated in the same manner as the Company's unaudited interim balance sheets using the deferral method of accounting. (iv) "ESTIMATED TOTAL MEMBERS EQUITY" is twenty-five million five hundred eighty-nine thousand dollars ($25,589,000), as set forth in paragraph 4 of the LOI. (v) "PRE-CLOSING TOTAL MEMBERS EQUITY" shall be the Total Members Equity shown on the unaudited balance sheet of the Company dated as of the last day of the calendar month immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "INTERIM BALANCE SHEET"). (vi) "CLOSING TOTAL MEMBERS EQUITY" shall be the Total Members Equity as of the Closing Date. (c) Members Equity Adjustment Amount. Promptly after the Closing, the Company shall prepare a balance sheet of the Company dated as of the Closing Date (the "CLOSING DATE BALANCE SHEET") on the same basis and applying the same accounting principles, policies, and practices that were used in preparing the 12/31/01 Balance Sheet, other than with respect to the account for "accrued aircraft maintenance," which shall be calculated in the same manner as, and on a consistent basis with, the Company's unaudited interim balance sheets using 2
the deferral method of accounting. The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC ("PWC"), the Company's independent accountants, and the fees and costs of PwC for such audit shall be shared equally between Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other. The Closing Total Members Equity shall be determined based upon the Closing Date Balance Sheet. The Company shall deliver the Closing Date Balance Sheet and its calculation of the Closing Total Members Equity to Sellers within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date. (ii) If, within thirty (30) days following delivery of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Total Members Equity calculation, any Seller has not given Buyer written notice of its objection as to the Closing Total Members Equity calculation (which notice shall state the basis of such Seller's objection), then the Closing Total Members Equity calculated by the Company, as audited by PwC, shall be binding and conclusive on the parties and shall be used in computing the Members Equity Adjustment Amount. (iii) If any Seller duly gives Buyer such notice of objection, and if Buyer and such Seller fail to resolve the issues outstanding with respect to the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Closing Total Members Equity within thirty (30) days of Buyer's receipt of such Seller's objection notice, Sellers and Buyer shall submit the issues remaining in dispute to Deloitte & Touche LLP, independent public accountants (the "INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS"), for resolution applying the principles, policies and practices referred to in Section 1.2(c)(i). If issues are submitted to the Independent Accountants for resolution, (A) Sellers and Buyer shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Independent Accountants such work papers and other documents and information relating to the disputed issues as the Independent Accountants may reasonably request and are available to that party or its agents, and Sellers and Buyer shall be afforded the opportunity to present to the Independent Accountants any material relating to the disputed issues and to discuss such issues with the Independent Accountants; (B) the determination by the Independent Accountants, as set forth in a notice to be delivered to both Sellers and Buyer within sixty (60) days of the submission to the Independent Accountants of the issues remaining in dispute, shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties and shall be used in the calculation of the Closing Total Members Equity; and (C) the non-prevailing party will bear the fees and costs of the Independent Accountants for such determination. (iv) Sellers or their designee will have the right to participate in the Company's preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and calculation of the Closing Total Members Equity. (d) Maintenance Adjustment. If the account for "accrued aircraft maintenance" set forth on the Closing Date Balance Sheet and used in the calculation of Closing Total Members Equity in accordance Section 1.2(c) exceeds 3
a debit balance of $500,000, then the Members Equity Adjustment Amount shall be reduced dollar for dollar by the amount of such excess. 1.3 Payment of Cash Portion of Purchase Price. (a) Payment at Closing. In accordance with Section 7.3, at the Closing Buyer shall deliver to the Sellers an amount equal to twenty-eight million dollars ($28,000,000), increased or decreased by the Preliminary Members Equity Adjustment Amount. Two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) of such payment shall be the amount previously paid by Buyer to Sellers in the form of a good faith deposit on April 4, 2002 (the "DEPOSIT"); one million dollars ($1,000,000) (the"INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW AMOUNT") of such payment shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent to be held in the Indemnification Escrow Account and delivered in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and the balance of such payment shall be delivered to the Sellers. (b) Payments upon Determination of the Members Equity Adjustment Amount. On or before the fifth (5th) business day following the final determination of the Closing Total Members Equity pursuant to Section 1.2(c), an amount equal to the difference between the Preliminary Members Equity Adjustment Amount and the Members Equity Adjustment Amount shall be paid by Buyer to the Sellers or by the Sellers to Buyer, as appropriate, so as to properly reflect the correct adjustment amount as if the Members Equity Adjustment Amount were known at Closing. 1.4 Certain Payments (a) 9-11 Receivable Amounts. Immediately prior to the Closing, the Company shall distribute to Sellers all of its right, title and interest in and to any and all amounts to be received by the Company in connection with the Company's application filed with the United States Department of Transportation on or about May 22, 2002, as may thereafter be amended from time to time, for compensation related to the events of September 11, 2001 (such amounts, the "9-11 RECEIVABLE AMOUNTS"). From and after the Closing, Buyer, acting as agent for Sellers, shall, and shall cause the Company to, (i) diligently pursue, and keep the Sellers reasonably informed on the status of, the Company's application described above, (ii) take any and all actions reasonably requested by Sellers, and otherwise cooperate fully with Sellers' efforts, to obtain the 9-11 Receivable Amounts, and (iii) pay the Sellers the 9-11 Receivable Amounts within five (5) days of receipt thereof by the Company. The aforementioned application is attached hereto as Schedule 1.4(a). (b) Contingent Consideration. Buyer shall pay the Sellers additional cash consideration, calculated on the basis of incremental cash receipts for Transports due to rate increases in applicable Medicare transport rate schedules after December 31, 2001, subject to the terms of this Section 1.4(b) (the "CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION PAYMENT" or "CCP"). The Contingent Consideration Payment shall be computed as follows: CCP = Percentage * (Actual Cash Receipts minus Calculated Cash Receipts minus $1,039,000 for each applicable Measurement Period) where 4
provided, however, that the aggregate CCP shall not exceed two million six - -------- ------- hundred thousand dollars ($2,600,000.00), and provided further that no payments --- -------- ------- ---- shall be due to Sellers with respect to any Transports made after the ninth (9th) anniversary of the Start Date. The Contingent Consideration Payment shall be calculated and recalculated on an annual basis for each Measurement Period until all cash has been received for all Transports occurring during each applicable Measurement Period. Within thirty (30) days after each applicable anniversary of the Start Date, Buyer shall provide Sellers with a report, setting forth in reasonable detail, the manner in which the CCP is calculated for each applicable Measurement Period, and during such 30-day period shall pay the CCP, if any, owed to Sellers as set forth in each report. (For example, within 30 days of the end of the third Measurement Period, the Buyer will provide Sellers with the following reports: (i) a third report for the CCP for the first Measurement Period; (ii) a second report for the CCP for the second 5
Measurement Period; and (iii) the first report for the CCP for the third Measurement Period.) Buyer shall also provide Sellers such other information as Sellers may reasonably request with respect to each such calculation and report. If, at any time between the Closing Date and ninth (9th) anniversary of the Start Date, any independent program under which Transports are being made is converted or otherwise replaced with a hospital contract or other similar program with the Buyer or any affiliate of Buyer, then the actual number of Transports that occurred during the twelve months immediately preceding the Start Date for a specific program should be added to the actual number of Transports that occurred during the applicable Measurement Period, less the actual number of Transports for that specific program that occurred during the applicable Measurement Period for purposes of clause (ii) of "Actual Cash Receipts" and "Calculated Cash Receipts." Attached hereto as Schedule 1.4(b) is --------------- an example of the calculation of the CCP. 1.5 Allocation of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price shall be allocated among the assets of the Company pursuant to an allocation to be mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Sellers at or prior to Closing, which allocation shall be prepared in accordance with Schedule 1.5 hereto, and all tax returns and ------------- reports, financial information and other books and records each of Buyer, the Company and Sellers with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be consistent with such allocation. It is the intention of the parties hereto that the Contingent Consideration Payment shall be allocated to those assets of the Company, such as goodwill, that are eligible for installment sale reporting under Section 453 of the Code.

ARTICLE IX INDEMNIFICATION 9.1 Indemnification of Sellers. Buyer agrees that notwithstanding the Closing and regardless of any investigation made at any time by or on behalf of the Sellers or of any information Sellers may have in respect of such investigation, Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and each officer, director and affiliate of each Seller (collectively, the "SELLER 24
INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") from and against any and all damages, losses, claims, liabilities, demands, charges, suits, penalties, costs and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in investigating and preparing for any litigation or proceeding) (such amounts, net of any insurance proceeds and net of any tax benefits associated with the payment of any such amounts, collectively being referred to herein as "INDEMNIFIABLE COSTS"), that any Seller Indemnified Party may sustain or to which any of the Seller Indemnified Parties may be subjected, arising out of (a) any misrepresentation, breach or default by Buyer of or under any of the representations and warranties, covenants, agreements or other provisions of this Agreement or any agreement or document executed in connection herewith; or (b) any failure by the Buyer duly to perform or observe any term, provision, covenant or agreement in this Agreement on the part of the Buyer to be performed or observed. 9.2 Indemnification of Buyer. (a) General. The Sellers agree that notwithstanding the Closing and regardless of any investigation made at any time by or on behalf of Buyer or of any information Buyer may have in respect of such investigation, the Sellers, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and each officer, director and affiliate of Buyer (collectively, the "BUYER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") from and against any and all Indemnifiable Costs, that any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties may sustain, or to which any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties may be subjected, arising out of (i) any misrepresentation, breach or default by the Company or the Sellers of or under any of the representations and warranties, covenants, agreements or other provisions of this Agreement or any agreement or document executed in connection herewith; or (ii) any failure by the Company or the Sellers duly to perform or observe any term, provision, covenant or agreement in this Agreement on the part of the Company or the Sellers to be performed or observed. (b) Limitations. The liability of the Sellers to Buyer under Section 9.2(a) shall be subject to the following limitations: (i) Deductible. Sellers shall not be liable for an ---------- Indemnifiable Costs unless the aggregate amount of Indemnifiable Costs incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties exceeds the sum of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) (the "DEDUCTIBLE") prior to the expiration of the Applicable Limitations Period, hereinafter defined, and then only to the extent of such excess (but subject to Sections 9.2(b)(ii) and (iii) below. (ii) General Liability Ceiling; Limitations on Recovery. The -------------------------------------------------- aggregate liability of the Sellers for Indemnifiable Costs shall not exceed the sum of (A) the Indemnification Escrow Amount, plus (B) the first five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) of the Contingent Consideration Payment. Further, except as provided in the next sentence, Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover Indemnifiable Costs solely and exclusively from (A) the funds held in the Indemnification Escrow Account and (B) the amounts, if any, that may become due from Buyer to the Sellers pursuant to Section 1.4(b) as to which the right of setoff is provided for in Section 9.3. Except as aforesaid, Buyer shall not have any recourse to any funds of the 25
Sellers. The limitation set forth in the preceding sentence shall not apply to indemnification for damages arising out of a breach of the representations and warranties contained in Section 2.12, to the limited extent they relate to the Sellers' filing of federal income tax returns and payment of federal income taxes for periods ending on or before the Closing, and Section 2.19. Following any Buyer Indemnified Party's recovery of Indemnifiable Costs from the funds held in the Indemnification Escrow Account, no other Buyer Indemnified Party shall have any right or recourse against Sellers as a result of the decrease in the funds thereafter available for indemnification for Indemnifiable Costs from the Indemnification Escrow Account. (iii) Time Limitations. No claim for indemnification of ----------------- Indemnifiable Costs may be asserted against any Seller unless a Buyer Indemnified Party gives written notice (a "NOTICE OF CLAIM") of the claim to Sellers, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for such claim and shall be accompanied by documentation supporting the claim, by no later than the expiration of the Applicable Limitation Period and, to the extent that indemnification for Indemnifiable Costs is sought from the Indemnification Escrow Account, no later than the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date. "APPLICABLE LIMITATION PERIOD" shall mean two (2) years, ending on the second anniversary of the Closing Date, except that the "Applicable Limitation Period" for claims for indemnification arising from a material breach of the representations and warranties contained in Section 2.12, to the limited extent related to the Sellers' filing of federal income tax returns and payment of federal income taxes for periods ending on or before the Closing, shall mean the statutory limitations period applicable to the filing of tax returns and payment of income taxes under the Code. If the Buyer Indemnified Party asserting any such claim for Indemnifiable Costs timely makes such a claim, then, subject to the Deductible and the provisions of Section 9.2(b)(ii) and (iii) and any other applicable conditions to recovery, neither the expiration of the Applicable Limitations Period nor the expiration of such one-year period shall, by itself, prevent such Buyer Indemnified Party from recovering the full amount of such Indemnifiable Costs. 9.3 Right of Setoff. At the time that Buyer sends a Notice of Claim with respect to Indemnifiable Costs, Buyer may, by further written notice to Sellers, set off the amount of such Indemnifiable Costs against payment of the Contingent Consideration Payment to the extent that such payments are subject to recovery by Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 9.2(b)(ii). The exercise of such right of setoff by Buyer in good faith, whether or not ultimately determined to be justified, shall not constitute an event of default under this Agreement. Sellers reserve the right to dispute and contest any such setoff and to recover any amounts improperly set off. Any such dispute will pursued in accordance with Section 12.9, and the non-prevailing party will bear the costs and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in investigating and preparing for any litigation or proceeding) of the prevailing party. 26
9.4 Cooperation. (a) Notice. Any party seeking indemnification under this Article IX (each, an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") will give prompt written notice to the party or parties from whom it seeks indemnification (collectively, the "INDEMNITOR") of any assertion, claim or demand which such Indemnified Party discovers or of which notice is received after the Closing and which might give rise to a claim by such Indemnified Party against the Indemnitor under this Article IX, stating in reasonable detail the nature, basis and amount thereof. (b) Claims for Money Damages. In case of any claim for money damages by a third party, any suit for money damages, any claim for money damages by any governmental body, or any legal, administrative or arbitration proceeding with respect to which the Indemnitor may have liability for money damages under the indemnity agreements contained in this Article IX, the Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent desired, to assume the defense thereof, and after notice from the Indemnitor of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnitor will not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, other than reasonable costs of investigation, unless the Indemnitor does not actually assume the defense thereof following notice of such election. Buyer or Sellers shall make available to the other and its attorneys and accountants, at all reasonable times, all books and records relating to such suit, claim or proceeding, and Buyer and Sellers will render to each other such assistance as may reasonably be required of each other in order to insure proper and adequate defense of any such suit, claim or proceeding. No Indemnified Party will make any settlement of any claim which might give rise to liability of the Indemnitor hereunder for money damages under the indemnity agreements contained in this Article IX without the consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the Indemnitor shall desire and be able to effect a monetary compromise or settlement of any such claim which settlement or monetary compromise shall fully and finally relieve the Indemnitor of any liability in connection with such cause of action and claim and the Indemnified Party shall refuse to consent to such compromise or settlement (to the extent it relates to money damages), then the liability of the Indemnitor to the Indemnified Party with respect to settlement of such claim shall be limited to the amount so offered in compromise or settlement. 9.5 Exclusive Remedy. Buyer hereby agrees that (a) the rights and remedies of Buyer and the Buyer Indemnified Parties contained in this Article IX to recover Indemnifiable Costs (subject to the limitations set forth herein) shall be the sole and exclusive rights and remedies that they shall have against the Company, either Seller or any other Seller Indemnified Party arising out of, relating to or resulting from this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, for (i) any misrepresentation, breach or default by the Company or the Sellers of or under any of the representations and warranties, covenants, agreements or other provisions of this Agreement or any agreement or document executed in connection herewith; or (ii) any failure by the Company or the Sellers duly to perform or observe any term, provision, covenant or agreement in this Agreement on the part of the Company or the Sellers to be performed or observed; (b) Buyer, for itself and the Buyer Indemnified Parties, including its and their respective successors and assigns, hereby waives and agrees that it or they will not assert or seek to enforce any other rights or remedies, whether available under statute, at common law or otherwise, that Buyer would otherwise have against the Company, either Seller or 27
any other Seller Indemnified Party arising out of, relating to or resulting from this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, (i) any misrepresentation, breach or default by the Company or the Sellers of or under any of the representations and warranties, covenants, agreements or other provisions of this Agreement or any agreement or document executed in connection herewith; or (ii) any failure by the Company or the Sellers duly to perform or observe any term, provision, covenant or agreement in this Agreement on the part of the Company or the Sellers to be performed or observed (collectively, "OTHER REMEDIES"); and (c) except as provided in the next sentence, Buyer shall hold harmless and indemnify the Company and the Seller Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs, representatives, successors and assigns from and against any claims, demands, actions, suits or other proceedings brought against any of them, and any liabilities, damages, costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by the Company or the Seller Indemnified Parties or any of their respective heirs, representatives, successors or assigns, arising out of any attempt or any efforts (successful or unsuccessful) by any Buyer Indemnified Party to assert or exercise any of the Other Remedies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Article IX with respect to the exclusive rights and remedies of the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not apply to any breach of representation or warranty of a Seller contained in this Agreement (as the same has been modified by the Schedules), if a court or arbitrator having jurisdiction has found that such Seller committed fraud and such finding has become final and is no longer appealable, provided, however, that the foregoing -------- ------- exception to the exclusive rights and remedies of the Buyer Indemnified Parties hereunder shall apply solely to such Seller found to have committed fraud; and provided, further, that the Deductible shall nevertheless continue to apply - -------- ------- notwithstanding any such finding or findings. 9.6 Prepayment Penalties. If the Company's lenders and lessors (other than lessors under the Company's operating leases) do not permit the continuation of the Company's debt after Closing and, as a result, the Company incurs any prepayment penalties related to such debt, then such prepayment penalties shall be the responsibility of Buyer and the Sellers as follows: (a) the first $500,000 of aggregate prepayment penalties shall be the sole responsibility of Buyer; (b) the next $500,000 of aggregate prepayment penalties shall be borne equally by the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand; and (c) any prepayment penalties exceeding $1,000,000 in the aggregate shall be the sole responsibility of Buyer. ARTICLE X TERMINATION 10.1 Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may, by written notice given at or prior to Closing in the manner hereinafter provided, be terminated or abandoned: (a) By mutual consent of Buyer, the Company and Sellers; 28
(b) By Sellers jointly if the Closing has not occurred on or before August 30, 2002 due to a failure of any of the conditions specified in Section 6.2 (other than Section 6.2(d)); (c) By Sellers jointly if there has been a material default or breach by Buyer with respect to the performance of any of Buyer's material covenants and agreements contained herein, or with respect to the correctness of any of Buyer's material representations and warranties contained herein (each, a "MATERIAL BUYER DEFAULT") and such default or breach persists for 10 business days of more after written notice thereof is given; (d) By Buyer if the Closing has not occurred on or before August 30, 2002 due to a failure of any of the conditions specified in Section 6.1 (other than Section 6.1(f)); (e) By Buyer if there has been a material default or breach by the Company or a Seller with respect to the performance of any of the Company's or a Seller's material covenants and agreements contained herein, or with respect to the correctness of any of the Company's or a Seller's material representations and warranties contained herein (each, a "MATERIAL SELLER DEFAULT") and such default or breach persists for 10 business days of more after written notice thereof is given; or (f) By Buyer, or by Sellers jointly if the Closing has not occurred on or before August 30, 2002; provided, however, that such date shall -------- ------- ---- be extended for such additional time as may be necessary (but in no event beyond October 31, 2002) (i) to comply with the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, (ii) to obtain any authorization, consent, waiver and approval of any federal, state, local and foreign governmental agency or regulatory authority required to be obtained (as reasonably determined by Buyer) in order to permit Buyer to acquire the Interests or (iii) to arrange additional financing should a substantial portion of the Company's lenders and lessors not permit the continuation of the Company's debt after the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the party seeking to exercise its termination right is in breach of any of its respective material obligations under this Agreement, such party shall not be entitled to exercise its termination right during the continuance of such breach. 10.2 Procedure Upon Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement by Buyer, the Company, or Sellers jointly pursuant to Section 10.1, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other parties hereto and the transactions contemplated herein shall be abandoned without further action by Buyer, the Company, or the Sellers. In addition, if this Agreement is terminated as provided herein: (a) Each party will redeliver all documents, work papers and other material of any other party relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, whether so obtained before or after the execution hereof, to the party furnishing the same. (b) All Confidential Information shall continue to be subject to the provisions of Article XI of this Agreement, which provisions shall survive any such termination, as well as the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement. (c) Upon a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(a), the respective obligations of the parties hereto under this Agreement (other than under Sections 10.2(a) and (b) above) shall terminate and no party shall have any liability whatsoever to any other party hereto by reason of such 29
termination. Any termination of this Agreement by Buyer pursuant to Section 10.1(d) or (e) due to a Material Seller Default, or by Sellers pursuant to Section 10.1(b) or (c) due to a Material Buyer Default, shall not relieve Sellers or the Buyer (as the case may be) of its liability hereunder to the non-defaulting party. If, notwithstanding a Material Seller Default or a Material Buyer Default, the Buyer (in the case of a Material Seller Default), or Sellers (in the case of a Material Buyer Default) closes the transactions contemplated hereby, such action by the non-defaulting party or parties shall constitute a waiver of such Material Seller Default or Material Buyer Default, as the case may be. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall the Sellers be liable to Buyer by reason of a material breach of this Agreement by the Sellers for any consequential damages, special damages or lost profits or lost business opportunities arising from such breach. 10.3 Specific Performance Upon Termination. Buyer, on the one hand, and the Company and Sellers, on the other hand, acknowledge that because an award of monetary damages would be inadequate for any breach of this Agreement by the other party, Buyer, the Company and Sellers, as the case may be, shall be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance. Such remedy is not exclusive, but in addition to all other remedies available to such parties at law or equity, as such remedies may be limited hereunder. 10.4 Non-Refundable Deposit. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Deposit shall be non-refundable unless Buyer shall have terminated this Agreement under Section 10.1(e) due to a Material Seller Default, in which event Sellers shall cause the Deposit to be refunded to Buyer, with interest, within 5 business days following such termination. ARTICLE XI CONFIDENTIALITY 11.1 Confidentiality Covenants Buyer, the Company and Sellers each acknowledge that they may have received access to Confidential Information (as hereinafter defined) of the others in the course of investigations and negotiations prior to Closing. Each party who receives any Confidential Information (a "RECEIVING PARTY") from any other party hereto (the "DISCLOSING PARTY"), may disclose any such Confidential Information to such party's employees, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors or agents or representatives that have a need to know such Information to facilitate or assist with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, "REPRESENTATIVES"). Subject to the foregoing exception, and the exception hereinafter set forth in Section 11.2 below, (i) a Receiving Party shall keep, and shall cause its Representatives to keep, all Confidential Information received from a Disclosing Party hereunder strictly confidential and shall not disclose, and shall cause its Representatives not to disclose, any such Confidential Information to any third party; and (ii) any Receiving Party and its Representatives shall not make any uses of Confidential Information received from a Disclosing Party except to facilitate or assist with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. "CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION" shall include any business, financial, technical or other information, including, but not limited to, business plans, forecasts, marketing plans or initiatives, customer, client and vendor lists, training materials 30
developed by the Disclosing Party, information regarding the identities, qualifications and compensation being paid to key employees, information received from customers, vendors or clients with the expectation, whether explicit or implicit, that such information would be protected from disclosure or dissemination to third parties, and other information the value of which to the Disclosing Party is dependent on the non-disclosure of such information; provided, however, that it shall not include information that, although - -------- ------- disclosed or made available by a Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives to a Receiving Party or any of its Representatives, (i) can be obtained by persons not subject to confidentiality or use restrictions from public sources, including periodicals, government and industry publications and other media that is readily accessible to the public or competitors of the Disclosing Party, (ii) has been disclosed by the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives to any unaffiliated third parties without the imposition of any restrictions or prohibitions on disclosure or use thereof and has been, as a result, disclosed by that third party to other third parties, or (iii) information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate convincingly was in its possession prior to its disclosure to the Receiving Party by the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives; provided, however, that the Receiving Party had not obtained -------- ------- possession of such Confidential information from any one that the Receiving Party knew or should have known was subject to restrictions on its right to disclose such information to the Receiving Party, either pursuant to an agreement or by reason of his position or relationship with the Disclosing Party. 11.2 Disclosure Pursuant to Legal Process. If a Receiving Party is required by subpoena or other legal process, or by laws applicable to it, to disclose or produce any Confidential Information belonging to a Disclosing Party, then, the Receiving Party shall (i) provide the Disclosing Party prompt notice thereof and copies, if possible, and, if not, a description, of the Confidential Information requested or required to be produced so that Disclosing Party may seek an order to quash such subpoena or other legal process or an appropriate protective order or may elect to waive compliance with the provisions of this Article XI as to any portion or all of such Confidential Information; (ii) consult with the Disclosing Party as to the advisability of taking legally available steps to quash or narrow such request, and (iii) provide such reasonable cooperation as the Disclosing Party may request in connection with efforts by the Disclosing Party to quash the subpoena or other legal process or to obtain a protective order with respect to the Confidential Information being sought. If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, a Receiving Party is nonetheless, in the opinion of his legal counsel, compelled to disclose or produce any such Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to any tribunal legally authorized to request and entitled to receive such Confidential Information or to any government agency with which the Receiving Party is required by law to file any such Information or otherwise stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty or liability, the Disclosing Party may disclose or produce such Confidential Information to such tribunal or government agency, notwithstanding the fact that such information may, as a result become available to the public, without incurring liability hereunder to the Disclosing Party; provided, -------- however, that the Receiving Party shall give the Disclosing Party written notice of the Confidential Information to be so disclosed or produced as far in advance of its disclosure or production as is practicable and shall use his commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, to the greatest extent practicable, an order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Confidential Information so required to be disclosed or produced. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that the Buyer may file a report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the 31
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and file as exhibits thereto, this Agreement and all schedules and exhibits hereto without requesting confidential treatment for such documents. 11.3 Termination of Confidentiality Obligations. The obligations of Buyer under this Article XI shall terminate at the Closing with respect to the Confidential Information of the Company. The obligations of the Buyer hereunder with respect to the Confidential Information of the Sellers and the obligations of each Seller hereunder, which shall be several and not joint, with respect to Confidential Information of the Company or Buyer, shall in each case survive the Closing for a period of two (2) years thereafter. In the event of a termination of this Agreement, the respective obligations of the Company and Sellers with respect to Confidential Information of Buyer and the obligations of Buyer with respect to Confidential Information of the Company and Sellers shall survive for a period of two (2) years from the date of such termination. ARTICLE XII MISCELLANEOUS 12.1 Modifications; Waiver. Any amendment, change or modification of this Agreement shall be void unless in writing and signed by all parties hereto. No failure or delay by any party hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder, and no course of dealing between or among any of the parties, shall operate as a waiver of any such right, power or privilege. No waiver of any default on any one occasion shall constitute a waiver of any subsequent or other default. No single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege shall preclude the further or full exercise thereof. 12.2 Notices.

THIS WARRANT AND ANY SHARES ACQUIRED UPON THE EXERCISE OF THIS WARRANT HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR AN EXEMPTION THEREFROM UNDER SUCH ACT. AIR METHODS CORPORATION COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANT NEW YORK, NEW YORK OCTOBER 16, 2008 AIR METHODS CORPORATION (the "COMPANY"), a Delaware corporation, for value received, hereby certifies that PRUDENTIAL CAPITAL PARTNERS MANAGEMENT FUND, L.P. or its registered assigns is entitled to purchase from the Company 14,204.765 duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.06 per share (the "ORIGINAL COMMON STOCK"), at an initial exercise price per share of $0.06 (the "INITIAL EXERCISE PRICE"), at any time or from time to time after the date hereof and prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the later of (i) October 16, 2008 and (ii) the date on or after October 16, 2008 which is 30 days after the date on which the Company has sent written notification to the holder hereof that this Warrant will expire if not exercised (the "EXPIRATION DATE"), all subject to the terms, conditions and adjustments set forth below in this Warrant. This Warrant is one of the Common Stock Purchase Warrants (the "WARRANTS", such term to include all Warrants issued in substitution therefor) originally issued in connection with the issue and sale by the Company of the Company's 12% Senior Subordinated Notes due October 16, 2007, in the aggregate principal amount of $23,000,000 (the "NOTES") pursuant to that certain Securities Purchase Agreement, dated of even date herewith (the "PURCHASE AGREEMENT"), between the Company, Mercy Air Service, Inc, a California corporation, ARCH Air Medical Service, Inc., a Missouri corporation, and Rocky Mountain Holdings, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company, on the one hand, and Prudential Capital Partners, L.P. and Prudential Capital Partners Management Fund, L.P., on the other hand (collectively, the "PURCHASERS"). The term "NOTES" as used herein shall include each Note delivered pursuant to any provision of the Purchase Agreement and each Note delivered in substitution or exchange for any such Note pursuant to any such provision. Certain capitalized ------------------- terms used in this Warrant are defined in Section 13. - -------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1. EXERCISE OF WARRANT. 1A. Manner of Exercise. This Warrant may be exercised by the -------------------- holder hereof, in whole or in part, during normal business hours on any Business Day on or after the date hereof to and including the Expiration Date, by surrender of this Warrant, with the form of subscription at the end hereof (or a reasonable facsimile thereof) duly executed by such holder, to the Company at its principal office (or, if such exercise shall be in connection with an underwritten public offering of shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) subject to this Warrant, at the location at which the underwriters shall have agreed to accept delivery thereof), accompanied by payment (except as otherwise provided in Section 1F), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated by the Company or by certified or official bank check payable to the order of the Company), in the amount obtained by multiplying (a) the number of shares of Original Common Stock (without giving effect to any adjustment therein) designated in such form of subscription by (b) $0.06. 1B. Adjustment to Number of Shares of Common Stock. The number of ---------------------------------------------- duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock which the holder of this Warrant shall be entitled to receive upon each exercise hereof shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock which would otherwise (but for the provisions of Section 2) be issuable upon such exercise, as designated by the holder hereof pursuant to Section 1A, by a fraction of which (x) the numerator is $0.06 and (y) the denominator is the Exercise Price in effect on the date of such exercise. The "EXERCISE PRICE" shall initially be $0.06 per share, shall be adjusted and readjusted from time to time as provided in Section 2 and, as so adjusted and readjusted, shall remain in effect until a further adjustment or readjustment thereof is required by Section 2. 1C. When Exercise Effective. Each exercise of this Warrant shall ------------------------ be deemed to have been effected and the Exercise Price shall be determined immediately prior to the close of business (unless such exercise shall be in connection with an underwritten public offering of shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) subject to this Warrant, in which event concurrently with such exercise) on the Business Day on which this Warrant shall have been surrendered to the Company as provided in Section 1A, and at such time the person or persons in whose name or names any certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) shall be issuable upon such exercise as provided in Section 1D shall be deemed to have become the holder or holders of record thereof. 1D. Delivery of Stock Certificates, etc. Promptly after the --------------------------------------- exercise of this Warrant, in whole or in part, and in any event within three Business Days thereafter (unless such exercise shall be in connection with an underwritten public offering of shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) subject to this Warrant, in which event concurrently with such exercise), the -2-
Company at its expense will cause to be issued in the name of and delivered to the holder hereof or, subject to Section 8, as such holder may direct, (1) a certificate or certificates for the number of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) to which such holder shall be entitled upon such exercise, and (2) in case such exercise is in part only, a new Warrant or Warrants of like tenor, specifying in the aggregate on the face or faces thereof the number of shares of Original Common Stock equal to the number of such shares specified on the face of this Warrant minus the number of such shares designated by the holder upon such exercise as provided in Section 1A. 1E. Fractional Shares. No fractional shares shall be issued upon ------------------ exercise of this Warrant and no payment or adjustment shall be made upon any exercise on account of any cash dividends (except as provided in Section 2B) on the Common Stock or Other Securities issued upon such exercise. If any fractional interest in a share of Common Stock would, except for the provisions of the first sentence of this Section 1E, be deliverable upon the exercise of this Warrant, the Company shall, in lieu of delivering the fractional share therefor, pay to the holder exercising this Warrant an amount in cash equal to the Market Price of such fractional interest. 1F. Cashless Exercise. As an alternative to exercise of this ------------------ Warrant by payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds (or by certified or official bank check), as provided above in Section 1A, the holder of this Warrant may exercise its right to purchase some or all of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Warrant, on a net basis without the exchange of any funds (a "CASHLESS EXERCISE"), such that the holder hereof receives that number of shares of Common Stock subscribed to pursuant to this Warrant less that number of shares of Common Stock, valued at Market Price, at the time of exercise equal to the aggregate Exercise Price that would otherwise have been paid by the holder of this Warrant for such shares of Common Stock. SECTION 2. PROTECTION AGAINST DILUTION OR OTHER IMPAIRMENT OF RIGHTS; ADJUSTMENT OF EXERCISE PRICE. 2A. Issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock. In case the ------------------------------------------------ Company, at any time or from time to time after October 16, 2002 (the "INITIAL DATE"), shall issue or sell Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 2C or 2D) without consideration or for a consideration per share (determined pursuant to Section 2E) less than the Market Price in effect, in each case, on the date of and immediately prior to such issue or sale, then, and in each such case, subject to Section 2H, the Exercise Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue or sale, to a price (calculated to the nearest .0001 of a cent) determined by multiplying such Exercise Price by a fraction, -3-
(a) the numerator of which shall be (i) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus (ii) ---- the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by the Company for the total number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or sold would purchase at the Market Price, and (b) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such issue or sale, provided that, for the purposes of this Section 2A, (x) immediately after any - -------- Additional Shares of Common Stock are deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 2C or 2D, such Additional Shares shall be deemed to be outstanding, and (y) treasury shares shall not be deemed to be outstanding. 2B. Extraordinary Dividends and Distributions. In case the -------------------------------------------- Company at any time or from time to time after the date hereof shall declare, order, pay or make a dividend or other distribution (including, without limitation, any distribution of other or additional stock or other securities or property or Options by way of dividend or spin-off, reclassification, recapitalization or similar corporate rearrangement and any redemption or acquisition of any such stock or Options on the Common Stock) other than (a) a dividend payable in Additional Shares of Common Stock or in Options for Common Stock or (b) a regular periodic dividend payable in cash and permitted to be made under the Dividend Restrictions, then, and in each such case, the Company shall pay over to the holder of this Warrant, on the date on which such dividend or other distribution is paid to the holders of Common Stock, the securities and other property (including cash) which such holder would have received if such holder had exercised this Warrant immediately prior to the record date fixed in connection with such dividend or other distribution. 2C. Treatment of Options and Convertible Securities. In case the ------------------------------------------------ Company, at any time or from time to time after the date hereof, shall issue, sell, grant or assume, or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive, any Options or Convertible Securities, whether or not such Options or the right to convert or exchange any such Convertible Securities are immediately exercisable, then, and in each such case, the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto, without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, issuable upon the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities (or the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and subsequent conversion or exchange of the Convertible Securities issued), shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of such -4-
issue, sale, grant or assumption or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, provided, that such -------- Additional Shares of Common Stock shall not be deemed to have been issued unless the consideration per share (determined pursuant to Section 2E) of such shares would be less than the Market Price in effect, in each case, on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, sale, grant or assumption or immediately prior to the close of business on such record date or, if the Common Stock trades on an ex-dividend basis, on the date prior to the commencement of ex-dividend trading, as the case may be, and provided, further, that in any such case in -------- ------- which Additional Shares of Common Stock are deemed to be issued, (a) if an adjustment of the Exercise Price shall be made upon the fixing of a record date as referred to in the first sentence of this Section 2C, no further adjustment of the Exercise Price shall be made as a result of the subsequent issue or sale of any Options or Convertible Securities for the purpose of which such record date was set; (b) no further adjustment of the Exercise Price shall be made upon the subsequent issue or sale of Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities; (c) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any change in the consideration payable to the Company, or change in the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof (by change of rate or otherwise), the Exercise Price computed upon the original issue, sale, grant or assumption thereof (or upon the occurrence of the record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such change becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect such change insofar as it affects such Options, or the rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities, which are outstanding at such time; (d) upon the expiration of any such Options or of the rights of conversion or exchange under any such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised (or upon purchase by the Company and cancellation or retirement of any such Options which shall not have been exercised or of any such Convertible Securities the rights of conversion or exchange under which shall not have been exercised), the Exercise Price computed upon the original issue, sale, grant or assumption thereof (or upon the occurrence of the record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon such expiration (or such cancellation or retirement, as the case may be), be recomputed as if: -5-
(i) in the case of Options for Common Stock or in the case of Convertible Securities, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or sold (or deemed issued or sold) were the Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any (and without duplication), actually issued or sold upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was (x) in the case of Options for Common Stock, an amount equal to (A) the consideration actually received by the Company for the issue, sale, grant or assumption of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus (B) the consideration actually received by the Company ---- upon such exercise, minus (C) the consideration paid by the Company ----- for any purchase of such Options which were not exercised, or (y) in the case of Convertible Securities, an amount equal to (A) the consideration actually received by the Company for the issue, sale, grant or assumption of all such Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus (B) the additional ---- consideration, if any, actually received by the Company upon such conversion or exchange, minus (C) the excess, if any, of the ----- consideration paid by the Company for any purchase of such Convertible Securities, the rights of conversion or exchange under which were not exercised, over an amount that would be equal to the Fair Value of the Convertible Securities so purchased if such Convertible Securities were not convertible into or exchangeable for Additional Shares of Common Stock, and (ii) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued or sold upon the exercise of such Options were issued at the time of the issue, sale, grant or assumption of such Options, and the consideration received by the Company for the Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have then been issued was an amount equal to (x) the consideration actually received by the Company for the issue, sale, grant or assumption of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus (y) the consideration ---- deemed to have been received by the Company (pursuant to Section 2E) upon the issue or sale of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised, minus (z) the ----- consideration paid by the Company for any purchase of such Options which were not exercised; and (e) no recomputation pursuant to subsection (c) or (d) above shall have the effect of increasing the Exercise Price then in effect by an amount in excess of the amount of the adjustment thereof originally made in respect of the issue, sale, grant or assumption of such Options or Convertible Securities. 2D. Treatment of Stock Dividends, Stock Splits, Etc. In case the ------------------------------------------------ Company, at any time or from time to time after the date hereof, shall declare or pay any dividend or other distribution on any class of securities of the Company payable in shares of Common Stock, or shall effect a subdivision of the -6-
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Stock), then, and in each such case, Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued (a) in the case of any such dividend or other distribution, immediately after the close of business on the record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, or (b) in the case of any such subdivision, at the close of business on the day immediately prior to the day upon which such corporate action becomes effective. 2E. Computation of Consideration. For the purposes of this ------------------------------ Warrant: (a) The consideration for the issue or sale of any Additional Shares of Common Stock or for the issue, sale, grant or assumption of any Options or Convertible Securities, irrespective of the accounting treatment of such consideration, (i) insofar as it consists of cash, shall be computed as the amount of cash received by the Company, and insofar as it consists of securities or other property, shall be computed as of the date immediately preceding such issue, sale, grant or assumption as the Fair Value of such consideration (or, if such consideration is received for the issue or sale of Additional Shares of Common Stock and the Market Price thereof is less than the Fair Value of such consideration, then such consideration shall be computed as the Market Price of such Additional Shares of Common Stock), in each case without deducting any expenses paid or incurred by the Company, any commissions or compensation paid or concessions or discounts allowed to underwriters, dealers or others performing similar services or any accrued interest or dividends in connection with such issue or sale, and (ii) in case Additional Shares of Common Stock are issued or sold or Options or Convertible Securities are issued, sold, granted or assumed together with other stock or securities or other assets of the Company for a consideration which covers both, shall be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clause (i) above, allocable to such Additional Shares of Common Stock or Options or Convertible Securities, as the case may be, all as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or the Company. (b) All Additional Shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities issued in payment of any dividend or other distribution on any class of stock of the Company and all Additional Shares of Common Stock issued to effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Stock) shall be deemed to have been issued without consideration. -7-
(c) Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued for consideration pursuant to Section 2C, relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to have been issued for a consideration per share determined by dividing (i) the total amount, if any, received and receivable by the Company as consideration for the issue, sale, grant or assumption of the Options or Convertible Securities in question, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the Company upon the exercise in full of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities or, in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, in each case computing such consideration as provided in the foregoing subsection (a), by (ii) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities. 2F. Adjustments for Combinations, Etc. In case the outstanding ------------------------------------ shares of Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such combination or consolidation shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination or consolidation, be proportionately increased. 2G. Dilution in Case of Other Securities. In case any Other ----------------------------------------- Securities shall be issued or sold or shall become subject to issue or sale upon the conversion or exchange of any stock (or Other Securities) of the Company (or any issuer of Other Securities or any other Person referred to in Section 2I) or to subscription, purchase or other acquisition pursuant to any Options issued or granted by the Company (or any such other issuer or Person) for a consideration such as to dilute the exercise rights granted by this Warrant on a basis to which the other provisions of this Section 2 do not apply, then, and in each such case, the computations, adjustments and readjustments provided for in this Warrant with respect to the Exercise Price shall be made as nearly as possible in the manner so provided and applied to determine the amount of Other Securities from time to time receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant, so as to protect the holder of this Warrant against the effect of such dilution. -8-
2H. Minimum Adjustment of Exercise Price. If the amount of any --------------------------------------- adjustment of the Exercise Price required hereunder would be less than one percent of the Exercise Price in effect at the time such adjustment is otherwise so required to be made, such amount shall be carried forward and adjustment with respect thereto made at the time of and together with any subsequent adjustment which, together with such amount and any other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate at least one percent of such Exercise Price; provided, -------- that upon the exercise of this Warrant, all adjustments carried forward and not theretofore made up to and including the date of such exercise shall be made to the nearest .0001 of a cent. 2I.

In case at any time the Company -------------------------- shall be a party to any transaction (including, without limitation, a merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, liquidation or recapitalization of the Common Stock) in which the previously outstanding Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for different securities of the Company or common stock or other securities of another corporation or interests in a noncorporate entity or other property (including cash), or any combination of any of the foregoing, or in which the Common Stock ceases to be a publicly traded security either listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange or quoted by the Nasdaq National Market or any successor thereto or comparable system (each such transaction being herein called the "TRANSACTION", and any Transaction that has not been duly approved by a majority of the members of the Company's board of directors as of the date hereof together with such directors as have been approved by the Company's board of directors as of the date hereof, or other directors approved by them (each such Transaction being herein called a "HOSTILE TRANSACTION"), the date on which the Transaction is first announced to the public being herein called the "ANNOUNCEMENT DATE", the date of consummation of the Transaction being herein called the "CONSUMMATION DATE", the Company (in the case of a recapitalization of the Common Stock or any other such transaction in which the Company retains substantially all of its assets and survives as a corporation) or such other corporation or entity (in each other case) being herein called the "ACQUIRING COMPANY", and the common stock (or equivalent equity interest) of the Acquiring Company being herein called the "ACQUIRER'S COMMON STOCK", except that if the Acquiring Company shall not meet the requirements set forth in subsections (d), (e) and (f) below and a corporation which directly or indirectly controls the Acquiring Company (a "PARENT") meets such requirements, "Acquiring Company" shall refer to such Parent and "Acquirer's Common Stock" shall refer to such Parent's common stock (or equivalent equity interests)), then, as a condition of the consummation of the Transaction, lawful and adequate provisions (in form reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders) shall be made so that the holder of this Warrant, (X) solely in the case of a Hostile Transaction, upon the exercise hereof at any time on or after the Consummation Date (but subject, in the case of an election pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) below, to the time limitation hereinafter provided for such election), -9-
(a) shall be entitled to receive, and this Warrant shall thereafter represent the right to receive, in lieu of the Common Stock issuable upon such exercise prior to the Consummation Date, shares of the Acquirer's Common Stock at an Exercise Price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the Consummation Date multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the Market Price per share of the Acquirer's Common Stock determined as of the Consummation Date and the denominator of which is the Market Price per share of the Common Stock determined as of the Consummation Date, or (ii) the Market Price per share of the Acquirer's Common Stock determined as of the Consummation Date (subject in each case to adjustments from and after the Consummation Date as nearly equivalent as possible to the adjustments provided for in this Warrant), or at the election of the holder of this Warrant pursuant to notice given to the Company within six months after the Consummation Date, (b) shall be entitled to receive, and this Warrant shall thereafter represent the right to receive, in lieu of each share of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise prior to the Consummation Date, either (i) the greatest amount of cash, securities or other property given to any stockholder in consideration for any share of Common Stock at any time during the period from and after the Announcement Date to and including the Consummation Date by the Acquiring Company, the Company or any Affiliate of either thereof, or (ii) the Market Price per share for the Acquirer's Common Stock, determined as of the day within the period from and after the Announcement Date to and including the Consummation Date for which the amount determined as provided in the definition of Market Price shall have been the greatest, or, if neither the Acquiring Company nor the Parent meets the requirements set forth in subsections (d), (e) and (f) below, at the election of the holder of this Warrant pursuant to notice given to the Company within six months after the Consummation Date, (c) shall be entitled to receive, within 30 days after such election, in full satisfaction of the exercise rights afforded under this Warrant to the holder thereof, an amount equal to the fair market value of such exercise rights as determined by an independent investment banker (with an established national reputation as a valuer of equity securities) selected by the Required Holders with the approval of the Company, such fair market value to be determined with regard to all material relevant factors but without regard to any negative effects on such value of the Transaction, and (Y) in the case of any Transaction other than a Hostile Transaction, shall be entitled to receive upon the exercise hereof at any time prior to the Consummation Date any of the following at the election of the holder of this Warrant made on or prior to the Consummation Date: -10-
(a) the Common Stock issuable upon such exercise; (b) in lieu of each share of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise prior to the Consummation Date, either (i) the greatest amount of cash, securities or other property given to any stockholder in consideration for any share of Common Stock at any time during the period from and after the Announcement Date to and including the Consummation Date by the Acquiring Company, the Company or any Affiliate of either thereof, or (ii) the Market Price per share for the Acquirer's Common Stock, determined as of the day within the period from and after the Announcement Date to and including the Consummation Date for which the amount determined as provided in the definition of Market Price shall have been the greatest; or, if neither the Acquiring Company nor the Parent meets the requirements set forth in subsections (d), (e) and (f) below, (c) in full satisfaction of the exercise rights afforded under this Warrant to the holder thereof, an amount equal to the fair market value of such exercise rights as determined by an independent investment banker (with an established national reputation as a valuer of equity securities) selected by the Required Holders with the approval of the Company, such fair market value to be determined with regard to all material relevant factors. In any election by the holder of this Warrant under subsection (b)(ii) of either of clauses (X) and (Y) of this Section 2I, the number of shares of the Acquirer's Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise or conversion of this Warrant shall be deemed to be such as shall result from adjustments thereto that would have been required if an election had been made under subsection (a) of clause (X) of this Section 2I. The Company agrees to obtain, and deliver to each holder of Warrants a copy of the determination of an independent investment banker (selected by the Required Holders pursuant to subsection (c) of clauses (X) or (Y) above, as applicable) necessary to permit elections under subsection (c) of clauses (X) or (Y) above, as applicable, within 15 days after the Consummation Date of any Transaction to which subsection (c) of clauses (X) or (Y), as applicable, applies. In the case of any Transaction other than a Hostile Transaction, to the extent that the holder of this Warrant shall not already have exercised this Warrant in full at the time immediately prior to the consummation of such Transaction, then the unexercised portion of this Warrant will be deemed to have been exercised at such time and the holder of this Warrant shall be deemed to have elected from subsection (b) of clause (Y). -11-
The requirements referred to above applicable to the Acquiring Company or its Parent are that, immediately after the Consummation Date: (d) it is a solvent corporation organized, under the laws of any state of the United States of America, having its common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange or quoted by the Nasdaq National Market or any successor thereto or comparable system, and such common stock continues to meet the requirements for such listing or quotation, (e) it is required to file, and in each of its three fiscal years immediately preceding the Consummation Date has filed, reports with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and (f) in the case of the Parent, such Parent is required to include the Acquiring Company in the consolidated financial statements contained in the Parent's Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Commission and is not itself included in the consolidated financial statements of any other Person (other than its consolidated subsidiaries). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Company shall not effect any Transaction unless prior to the consummation thereof each corporation or entity (other than the Company) which may be required to deliver any securities or other property upon the exercise of Warrants shall assume, by written instrument delivered to each holder of Warrants, the obligation to deliver to such holder such securities or other property as to which, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such holder may be entitled, and, solely in the case of a Hostile Transaction, such corporation or entity shall have similarly delivered to each holder of Warrants an opinion of counsel for such corporation or entity, satisfactory to each holder of Warrants, which opinion shall state that all the outstanding Warrants shall thereafter continue in full force and effect and shall be enforceable against such corporation or entity in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, and addresses such other matters as such holders may reasonably request. 2J. Certain Issues Excepted. Anything herein to the contrary ----------------------- notwithstanding, the Company shall not be required to make any adjustment of the Exercise Price in the case of (i) the issuance of the Warrants and the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, (ii) any issuance of shares of Common Stock upon the exercise by the holder hereof of the preemptive rights provided in Section 10 of the Stockholders' Agreement or (iii) the issuance of up to 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock upon the purchase thereof by Company employees under an employee stock purchase plan or the exercise of options granted pursuant to stock option plans for employees and directors of the Company, in each case adopted by the Company's board of directors prior to or after the date of this Warrant, provided that if any such options shall -12-
expire or terminate, in whole or in part, without having been exercised in full, the shares of Common Stock not acquired under such options shall be added to the number of shares of Common Stock subject to this clause (iii) (any adjustment or issuance referred to in this Section 2J, a "PERMITTED EVENT"). 2K. Notice of Adjustment. Upon the occurrence of any event ---------------------- requiring an adjustment of the Exercise Price, then and in each such case the Company shall promptly deliver to the holder of this Warrant an Officer's Certificate stating the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment and the increase or decrease, if any, in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant, setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which such calculation is based. 2L. Other Notices. In case at any time: ------------- (a) the Company shall declare to the holders of Common Stock any dividend other than a regular periodic cash dividend or any periodic cash dividend in excess of 115% of the cash dividend for the comparable fiscal period in the immediately preceding fiscal year; (b) the Company shall declare or pay any dividend upon Common Stock payable in stock or make any special dividend or other distribution (other than regular cash dividends) to the holders of Common Stock; (c) the Company shall offer for subscription pro rata to the holders of Common Stock any additional shares of stock of any class or other rights; (d) there shall be any capital reorganization, or reclassification of the capital stock of the Company, or consolidation or merger of the Company with, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets to, another corporation or other entity; (e) there shall be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company; (f) there shall be made any tender offer for any shares of capital stock of the Company; or (g) there shall be any other Transaction; then, in any one or more of such cases, the Company shall give to the holder of this Warrant (i) at least 20 days prior to any event referred to in subsection (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) above, and within 5 days after it has knowledge of any pending tender offer or other Transaction, written notice of the date on which -13-
the books of the Company shall close or a record shall be taken for such dividend, distribution or subscription rights or for determining rights to vote in respect of any such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation, winding-up or Transaction or the date by which stockholders must tender shares in any tender offer and (ii) in the case of any such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation, winding-up or tender offer or Transaction known to the Company, at least 20 days prior written notice of the date (or, if not then known, a reasonable approximation thereof by the Company) when the same shall take place. Such notice in accordance with the foregoing clause (i) shall also specify, in the case of any such dividend, distribution or subscription rights, the date on which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled thereto, and such notice in accordance with the foregoing clause (ii) shall also specify the date on which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation, winding-up, tender offer or Transaction, as the case may be. Such notice shall also state that the action in question or the record date is subject to the effectiveness of a registration statement under the Securities Act or to a favorable vote of security holders, if either is required. 2M. Certain Events. If any event occurs as to which the other --------------- provisions of this Warrant are not strictly applicable or if strictly applicable would not fairly protect the exercise rights of the holders of this Warrant in accordance with the essential intent and principles of such provisions, then, notwithstanding any limitation on amendments or other modifications set forth in any of the Transaction Documents to the contrary, the terms of this Warrant shall be adjusted by the Company and the Required Holders on a basis consistent with such essential intent and principles, necessary to preserve, without dilution, the rights of the holders of the Warrants; provided, that no such -------- adjustment shall have the effect of increasing the Exercise Price as otherwise determined pursuant to this Warrant. The Company may make such reductions in the Exercise Price as it deems advisable, including any reductions necessary to ensure that any event treated for federal income tax purposes as a distribution of stock or stock rights not be taxable to recipients. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Warrant, the amount of consideration per share of Common Stock paid upon any exercise of this Warrant (whether such consideration is paid in cash or pursuant to Section 1F) pursuant to Section 1A and after giving effect to the adjustment in the number of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 1B shall not be less than the then applicable par value of the Common Stock; provided that, in the event the consideration per share of Common Stock -------- paid upon exercise of this Warrant shall be higher as a result of the application of this sentence (the extent to which such consideration per share is higher multiplied by the number of shares for which this Warrant is then -------------- exercisable being referred to as the "ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION"), then the number of shares for which this Warrant is then exercisable shall automatically be increased such that the value of such additional shares, net of the par value required to be paid therefor, shall equal the value of the Additional Consideration. -14-
2N. Prohibition of Certain Actions. The Company will not, by --------------------------------- amendment of its certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Company, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Warrant and in the taking of all such action as may reasonably be requested by the holder of this Warrant in order to protect the exercise privilege of the holder of this Warrant against dilution or other impairment, consistent with the tenor and purpose of this Warrant. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company (a) will not increase the par value of any shares of Common Stock receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant above the Exercise Price then in effect, (b) will take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of all Warrants from time to time outstanding, (c) will not take any action which results in any adjustment of the Exercise Price if the total number of shares of Common Stock or Other Securities issuable after the action upon the exercise of all of the Warrants would exceed the total number of shares of Common Stock or Other Securities then authorized by the Company's certificate of incorporation and available for the purpose of issue upon such conversion, and (d) will not issue any capital stock of any class which has the right to more than one vote per share or any capital stock of any class which is preferred as to dividends or as to the distribution of assets upon voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up, unless the rights of the holders thereof shall be limited to a fixed sum or percentage (or floating rate related to market yields) of par value or stated value in respect of participation in dividends and a fixed sum or percentage of par value or stated value in any such distribution of assets. SECTION 3. STOCK TO BE RESERVED. The Company will at all times reserve and keep available out of the authorized Common Stock, solely for the purpose of issue upon the exercise of the Warrants as herein provided, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall then be issuable upon the exercise of all outstanding Warrants, and the Company will maintain at all times all other rights and privileges sufficient to enable it to fulfill all its obligations hereunder. The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock which shall be so issuable shall, upon issuance, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, free from preemptive or similar rights on the part of the holders of any shares of capital stock or securities of the Company or any other Person, and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof (not including any income taxes payable by the holders of Warrants being exercised in respect of gains thereon), and the Exercise Price will be credited to the capital and surplus of the Company. The Company will take all such action as may be necessary to assure that such shares of Common Stock may be so issued without violation of any applicable law or regulation, or of any applicable requirements of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and of any domestic securities exchange upon which the Common Stock may be listed. -15-
SECTION 4. REGISTRATION OF COMMON STOCK. If any shares of Common Stock required to be reserved for purposes of the exercise of Warrants require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law (other than the Securities Act, registration under which is governed by the Stockholders' Agreement), before such shares may be issued upon the exercise thereof, the Company will, at its expense and as expeditiously as possible, use its best efforts to cause such shares to be duly registered or approved, as the case may be. Shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants shall be registered by the Company under the Securities Act or similar statute then in force if required by the Stockholders' Agreement and subject to the conditions stated in such agreement. At any such time as the Common Stock is listed on any national securities exchange or quoted by the Nasdaq National Market or any successor thereto or any comparable system, the Company will, at its expense, obtain promptly and maintain the approval for the listing on each such exchange or the quoting by the Nasdaq National Market or such successor thereto or comparable system, upon official notice of issuance, of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the then outstanding Warrants and maintain the listing or quoting of such shares after their issuance so long as the Common Stock is so listed or quoted; and the Company will also cause to be so listed or quoted, will maintain such listing or quoting of and will obtain any required registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law (other than the Securities Act, registration under which is governed by the Stockholders' Agreement) with respect to any Other Securities that at any time are issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, if and at the time that any securities of the same class shall be listed on such national securities exchange by the Company.

No provision of this Warrant, in the absence of the actual exercise of such Warrant and receipt by the holder thereof of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, shall give rise to any liability on the part of such holder as a stockholder of the Company, whether such liability shall be asserted by the Company or by creditors of the Company.

AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION. The Company will cooperate with each holder of any Restricted Securities in supplying such information as may be necessary for such holder to complete and file any information-reporting forms presently or hereafter required by the Commission as a condition to the availability of an exemption from the Securities Act for the sale of any Restricted Securities. The Company will furnish to each registered holder of any Warrants, promptly upon their becoming available, copies of all financial statements, reports, notices and proxy statements sent or made available generally by the Company to its stockholders, and copies of all regular and periodic reports filed by the Company with any securities exchange or with the Commission.

Upon the surrender of any --------------------------------- Warrant, properly endorsed, for registration of transfer or for exchange at the principal office of the Company, the Company at its expense will (subject to compliance with Section 8, if applicable) execute and deliver to or upon the order of the holder thereof a new Warrant or Warrants of like tenor, in the name of such holder or as such holder (upon payment by such holder of any applicable transfer taxes) may direct, calling in the aggregate on the face or faces thereof for the number of shares of Original Common Stock called for on the face or faces of the Warrant or Warrants so surrendered. 12C. Replacement of Warrants. Upon receipt of evidence reasonably ----------------------- satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Warrant and, in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction of any Warrant held by a Person other than the Purchaser, upon delivery of its unsecured indemnity or, in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender of such Warrant for cancellation at the principal office of the Company, the Company at its expense will execute and deliver, in lieu thereof, a new Warrant of like tenor. -18-

THIS WARRANT AND ANY SHARES ACQUIRED UPON THE EXERCISE OF THIS WARRANT HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR AN EXEMPTION THEREFROM UNDER SUCH ACT. AIR METHODS CORPORATION COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANT NEW YORK, NEW YORK OCTOBER 16, 2008 AIR METHODS CORPORATION (the "COMPANY"), a Delaware corporation, for value received, hereby certifies that PRUDENTIAL CAPITAL PARTNERS, L.P. or its registered assigns is entitled to purchase from the Company 429,019.235 duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.06 per share (the "ORIGINAL COMMON STOCK"), at an initial exercise price per share of $0.06 (the "INITIAL EXERCISE PRICE"), at any time or from time to time after the date hereof and prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the later of (i) October 16, 2008 and (ii) the date on or after October 16, 2008 which is 30 days after the date on which the Company has sent written notification to the holder hereof that this Warrant will expire if not exercised (the "EXPIRATION DATE"), all subject to the terms, conditions and adjustments set forth below in this Warrant. This Warrant is one of the Common Stock Purchase Warrants (the "WARRANTS", such term to include all Warrants issued in substitution therefor) originally issued in connection with the issue and sale by the Company of the Company's 12% Senior Subordinated Notes due October 16, 2007, in the aggregate principal amount of $23,000,000 (the "NOTES") pursuant to that certain Securities Purchase Agreement, dated of even date herewith (the "PURCHASE AGREEMENT"), between the Company, Mercy Air Service, Inc, a California corporation, ARCH Air Medical Service, Inc., a Missouri corporation, and Rocky Mountain Holdings, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company, on the one hand, and Prudential Capital Partners, L.P. and Prudential Capital Partners Management Fund, L.P., on the other hand (collectively, the "PURCHASERS"). The term "NOTES" as used herein shall include each Note delivered pursuant to any provision of the Purchase Agreement and each Note delivered in substitution or exchange for any such Note pursuant to any such provision. Certain capitalized ------------------- terms used in this Warrant are defined in Section 13. - -------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1. EXERCISE OF WARRANT. 1A. Manner of Exercise. This Warrant may be exercised by the -------------------- holder hereof, in whole or in part, during normal business hours on any Business Day on or after the date hereof to and including the Expiration Date, by surrender of this Warrant, with the form of subscription at the end hereof (or a reasonable facsimile thereof) duly executed by such holder, to the Company at its principal office (or, if such exercise shall be in connection with an underwritten public offering of shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) subject to this Warrant, at the location at which the underwriters shall have agreed to accept delivery thereof), accompanied by payment (except as otherwise provided in Section 1F), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated by the Company or by certified or official bank check payable to the order of the Company), in the amount obtained by multiplying (a) the number of shares of Original Common Stock (without giving effect to any adjustment therein) designated in such form of subscription by (b) $0.06. 1B. Adjustment to Number of Shares of Common Stock. The number of ---------------------------------------------- duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock which the holder of this Warrant shall be entitled to receive upon each exercise hereof shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock which would otherwise (but for the provisions of Section 2) be issuable upon such exercise, as designated by the holder hereof pursuant to Section 1A, by a fraction of which (x) the numerator is $0.06 and (y) the denominator is the Exercise Price in effect on the date of such exercise. The "EXERCISE PRICE" shall initially be $0.06 per share, shall be adjusted and readjusted from time to time as provided in Section 2 and, as so adjusted and readjusted, shall remain in effect until a further adjustment or readjustment thereof is required by Section 2. 1C. When Exercise Effective. Each exercise of this Warrant shall ------------------------ be deemed to have been effected and the Exercise Price shall be determined immediately prior to the close of business (unless such exercise shall be in connection with an underwritten public offering of shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) subject to this Warrant, in which event concurrently with such exercise) on the Business Day on which this Warrant shall have been surrendered to the Company as provided in Section 1A, and at such time the person or persons in whose name or names any certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) shall be issuable upon such exercise as provided in Section 1D shall be deemed to have become the holder or holders of record thereof. 1D. Delivery of Stock Certificates, etc. Promptly after the --------------------------------------- exercise of this Warrant, in whole or in part, and in any event within three Business Days thereafter (unless such exercise shall be in connection with an underwritten public offering of shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) subject to this Warrant, in which event concurrently with such exercise), the Company at its expense will cause to be issued in the name of and delivered to the holder hereof or, subject to Section 8, as such holder may direct, -2-
(1) a certificate or certificates for the number of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) to which such holder shall be entitled upon such exercise, and (2) in case such exercise is in part only, a new Warrant or Warrants of like tenor, specifying in the aggregate on the face or faces thereof the number of shares of Original Common Stock equal to the number of such shares specified on the face of this Warrant minus the number of such shares designated by the holder upon such exercise as provided in Section 1A. 1E. Fractional Shares. No fractional shares shall be issued upon ------------------ exercise of this Warrant and no payment or adjustment shall be made upon any exercise on account of any cash dividends (except as provided in Section 2B) on the Common Stock or Other Securities issued upon such exercise. If any fractional interest in a share of Common Stock would, except for the provisions of the first sentence of this Section 1E, be deliverable upon the exercise of this Warrant, the Company shall, in lieu of delivering the fractional share therefor, pay to the holder exercising this Warrant an amount in cash equal to the Market Price of such fractional interest. 1F. Cashless Exercise. As an alternative to exercise of this ------------------ Warrant by payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds (or by certified or official bank check), as provided above in Section 1A, the holder of this Warrant may exercise its right to purchase some or all of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Warrant, on a net basis without the exchange of any funds (a "CASHLESS EXERCISE"), such that the holder hereof receives that number of shares of Common Stock subscribed to pursuant to this Warrant less that number of shares of Common Stock, valued at Market Price, at the time of exercise equal to the aggregate Exercise Price that would otherwise have been paid by the holder of this Warrant for such shares of Common Stock. SECTION 2. PROTECTION AGAINST DILUTION OR OTHER IMPAIRMENT OF RIGHTS; ADJUSTMENT OF EXERCISE PRICE. 2A. Issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock. In case the ------------------------------------------------ Company, at any time or from time to time after October 16, 2002 (the "INITIAL DATE"), shall issue or sell Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 2C or 2D) without consideration or for a consideration per share (determined pursuant to Section 2E) less than the Market Price in effect, in each case, on the date of and immediately prior to such issue or sale, then, and in each such case, subject to Section 2H, the Exercise Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue or sale, to a price (calculated to the nearest .0001 of a cent) determined by multiplying such Exercise Price by a fraction, -3-
(a) the numerator of which shall be (i) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus (ii) ---- the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by the Company for the total number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or sold would purchase at the Market Price, and (b) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such issue or sale, provided that, for the purposes of this Section 2A, (x) immediately after any - -------- Additional Shares of Common Stock are deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 2C or 2D, such Additional Shares shall be deemed to be outstanding, and (y) treasury shares shall not be deemed to be outstanding. 2B. Extraordinary Dividends and Distributions. In case the -------------------------------------------- Company at any time or from time to time after the date hereof shall declare, order, pay or make a dividend or other distribution (including, without limitation, any distribution of other or additional stock or other securities or property or Options by way of dividend or spin-off, reclassification, recapitalization or similar corporate rearrangement and any redemption or acquisition of any such stock or Options on the Common Stock) other than (a) a dividend payable in Additional Shares of Common Stock or in Options for Common Stock or (b) a regular periodic dividend payable in cash and permitted to be made under the Dividend Restrictions, then, and in each such case, the Company shall pay over to the holder of this Warrant, on the date on which such dividend or other distribution is paid to the holders of Common Stock, the securities and other property (including cash) which such holder would have received if such holder had exercised this Warrant immediately prior to the record date fixed in connection with such dividend or other distribution. 2C. Treatment of Options and Convertible Securities. In case the ------------------------------------------------ Company, at any time or from time to time after the date hereof, shall issue, sell, grant or assume, or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive, any Options or Convertible Securities, whether or not such Options or the right to convert or exchange any such Convertible Securities are immediately exercisable, then, and in each such case, the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto, without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, issuable upon the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities (or the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and subsequent conversion or exchange of the Convertible Securities issued), shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of such -4-
issue, sale, grant or assumption or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, provided, that such -------- Additional Shares of Common Stock shall not be deemed to have been issued unless the consideration per share (determined pursuant to Section 2E) of such shares would be less than the Market Price in effect, in each case, on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, sale, grant or assumption or immediately prior to the close of business on such record date or, if the Common Stock trades on an ex-dividend basis, on the date prior to the commencement of ex-dividend trading, as the case may be, and provided, further, that in any such case in -------- ------- which Additional Shares of Common Stock are deemed to be issued, (a) if an adjustment of the Exercise Price shall be made upon the fixing of a record date as referred to in the first sentence of this Section 2C, no further adjustment of the Exercise Price shall be made as a result of the subsequent issue or sale of any Options or Convertible Securities for the purpose of which such record date was set; (b) no further adjustment of the Exercise Price shall be made upon the subsequent issue or sale of Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities; (c) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any change in the consideration payable to the Company, or change in the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof (by change of rate or otherwise), the Exercise Price computed upon the original issue, sale, grant or assumption thereof (or upon the occurrence of the record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such change becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect such change insofar as it affects such Options, or the rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities, which are outstanding at such time; (d) upon the expiration of any such Options or of the rights of conversion or exchange under any such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised (or upon purchase by the Company and cancellation or retirement of any such Options which shall not have been exercised or of any such Convertible Securities the rights of conversion or exchange under which shall not have been exercised), the Exercise Price computed upon the original issue, sale, grant or assumption thereof (or upon the occurrence of the record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon such expiration (or such cancellation or retirement, as the case may be), be recomputed as if: -5-
(i) in the case of Options for Common Stock or in the case of Convertible Securities, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or sold (or deemed issued or sold) were the Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any (and without duplication), actually issued or sold upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was (x) in the case of Options for Common Stock, an amount equal to (A) the consideration actually received by the Company for the issue, sale, grant or assumption of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus (B) the consideration actually received by the Company ---- upon such exercise, minus (C) the consideration paid by the Company ----- for any purchase of such Options which were not exercised, or (y) in the case of Convertible Securities, an amount equal to (A) the consideration actually received by the Company for the issue, sale, grant or assumption of all such Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus (B) the additional ---- consideration, if any, actually received by the Company upon such conversion or exchange, minus (C) the excess, if any, of the ----- consideration paid by the Company for any purchase of such Convertible Securities, the rights of conversion or exchange under which were not exercised, over an amount that would be equal to the Fair Value of the Convertible Securities so purchased if such Convertible Securities were not convertible into or exchangeable for Additional Shares of Common Stock, and (ii) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued or sold upon the exercise of such Options were issued at the time of the issue, sale, grant or assumption of such Options, and the consideration received by the Company for the Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have then been issued was an amount equal to (x) the consideration actually received by the Company for the issue, sale, grant or assumption of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus (y) the consideration ---- deemed to have been received by the Company (pursuant to Section 2E) upon the issue or sale of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised, minus (z) the ----- consideration paid by the Company for any purchase of such Options which were not exercised; and (e) no recomputation pursuant to subsection (c) or (d) above shall have the effect of increasing the Exercise Price then in effect by an amount in excess of the amount of the adjustment thereof originally made in respect of the issue, sale, grant or assumption of such Options or Convertible Securities. 2D. Treatment of Stock Dividends, Stock Splits, Etc. In case the ------------------------------------------------ Company, at any time or from time to time after the date hereof, shall declare or pay any dividend or other distribution on any class of securities of the Company payable in shares of Common Stock, or shall effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common -6-
Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Stock), then, and in each such case, Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued (a) in the case of any such dividend or other distribution, immediately after the close of business on the record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, or (b) in the case of any such subdivision, at the close of business on the day immediately prior to the day upon which such corporate action becomes effective. 2E. Computation of Consideration. For the purposes of this ---------------------------- Warrant: (a) The consideration for the issue or sale of any Additional Shares of Common Stock or for the issue, sale, grant or assumption of any Options or Convertible Securities, irrespective of the accounting treatment of such consideration, (i) insofar as it consists of cash, shall be computed as the amount of cash received by the Company, and insofar as it consists of securities or other property, shall be computed as of the date immediately preceding such issue, sale, grant or assumption as the Fair Value of such consideration (or, if such consideration is received for the issue or sale of Additional Shares of Common Stock and the Market Price thereof is less than the Fair Value of such consideration, then such consideration shall be computed as the Market Price of such Additional Shares of Common Stock), in each case without deducting any expenses paid or incurred by the Company, any commissions or compensation paid or concessions or discounts allowed to underwriters, dealers or others performing similar services or any accrued interest or dividends in connection with such issue or sale, and (ii) in case Additional Shares of Common Stock are issued or sold or Options or Convertible Securities are issued, sold, granted or assumed together with other stock or securities or other assets of the Company for a consideration which covers both, shall be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clause (i) above, allocable to such Additional Shares of Common Stock or Options or Convertible Securities, as the case may be, all as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or the Company. (b) All Additional Shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities issued in payment of any dividend or other distribution on any class of stock of the Company and all Additional Shares of Common Stock issued to effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Stock) shall be deemed to have been issued without consideration. -7-
(c) Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued for consideration pursuant to Section 2C, relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to have been issued for a consideration per share determined by dividing (i) the total amount, if any, received and receivable by the Company as consideration for the issue, sale, grant or assumption of the Options or Convertible Securities in question, plus the minimum ---- aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the Company upon the exercise in full of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities or, in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, in each case computing such consideration as provided in the foregoing subsection (a), by (ii) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities. 2F. Adjustments for Combinations, Etc. In case the outstanding ------------------------------------ shares of Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such combination or consolidation shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination or consolidation, be proportionately increased. 2G. Dilution in Case of Other Securities. In case any Other ----------------------------------------- Securities shall be issued or sold or shall become subject to issue or sale upon the conversion or exchange of any stock (or Other Securities) of the Company (or any issuer of Other Securities or any other Person referred to in Section 2I) or to subscription, purchase or other acquisition pursuant to any Options issued or granted by the Company (or any such other issuer or Person) for a consideration such as to dilute the exercise rights granted by this Warrant on a basis to which the other provisions of this Section 2 do not apply, then, and in each such case, the computations, adjustments and readjustments provided for in this Warrant with respect to the Exercise Price shall be made as nearly as possible in the manner so provided and applied to determine the amount of Other Securities from time to time receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant, so as to protect the holder of this Warrant against the effect of such dilution. -8-
2H. Minimum Adjustment of Exercise Price. If the amount of any --------------------------------------- adjustment of the Exercise Price required hereunder would be less than one percent of the Exercise Price in effect at the time such adjustment is otherwise so required to be made, such amount shall be carried forward and adjustment with respect thereto made at the time of and together with any subsequent adjustment which, together with such amount and any other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate at least one percent of such Exercise Price; provided, -------- that upon the exercise of this Warrant, all adjustments carried forward and not theretofore made up to and including the date of such exercise shall be made to the nearest .0001 of a cent. 2I. Changes in Common Stock. In case at any time the Company -------------------------- shall be a party to any transaction (including, without limitation, a merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, liquidation or recapitalization of the Common Stock) in which the previously outstanding Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for different securities of the Company or common stock or other securities of another corporation or interests in a noncorporate entity or other property (including cash), or any combination of any of the foregoing, or in which the Common Stock ceases to be a publicly traded security either listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange or quoted by the Nasdaq National Market or any successor thereto or comparable system (each such transaction being herein called the "TRANSACTION", and any Transaction that has not been duly approved by a majority of the members of the Company's board of directors as of the date hereof together with such directors as have been approved by the Company's board of directors as of the date hereof, or other directors approved by them (each such Transaction being herein called a "HOSTILE TRANSACTION"), the date on which the Transaction is first announced to the public being herein called the "ANNOUNCEMENT DATE", the date of consummation of the Transaction being herein called the "CONSUMMATION DATE", the Company (in the case of a recapitalization of the Common Stock or any other such transaction in which the Company retains substantially all of its assets and survives as a corporation) or such other corporation or entity (in each other case) being herein called the "ACQUIRING COMPANY", and the common stock (or equivalent equity interest) of the Acquiring Company being herein called the "ACQUIRER'S COMMON STOCK", except that if the Acquiring Company shall not meet the requirements set forth in subsections (d), (e) and (f) below and a corporation which directly or indirectly controls the Acquiring Company (a "PARENT") meets such requirements, "Acquiring Company" shall refer to such Parent and "Acquirer's Common Stock" shall refer to such Parent's common stock (or equivalent equity interests)), then, as a condition of the consummation of the Transaction, lawful and adequate provisions (in form reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders) shall be made so that the holder of this Warrant, (X) solely in the case of a Hostile Transaction, upon the exercise hereof at any time on or after the Consummation Date (but subject, in the case of an election pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) below, to the time limitation hereinafter provided for such election), -9-
(a) shall be entitled to receive, and this Warrant shall thereafter represent the right to receive, in lieu of the Common Stock issuable upon such exercise prior to the Consummation Date, shares of the Acquirer's Common Stock at an Exercise Price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the Consummation Date multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the Market Price per share of the Acquirer's Common Stock determined as of the Consummation Date and the denominator of which is the Market Price per share of the Common Stock determined as of the Consummation Date, or (ii) the Market Price per share of the Acquirer's Common Stock determined as of the Consummation Date (subject in each case to adjustments from and after the Consummation Date as nearly equivalent as possible to the adjustments provided for in this Warrant), or at the election of the holder of this Warrant pursuant to notice given to the Company within six months after the Consummation Date, (b) shall be entitled to receive, and this Warrant shall thereafter represent the right to receive, in lieu of each share of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise prior to the Consummation Date, either (i) the greatest amount of cash, securities or other property given to any stockholder in consideration for any share of Common Stock at any time during the period from and after the Announcement Date to and including the Consummation Date by the Acquiring Company, the Company or any Affiliate of either thereof, or (ii) the Market Price per share for the Acquirer's Common Stock, determined as of the day within the period from and after the Announcement Date to and including the Consummation Date for which the amount determined as provided in the definition of Market Price shall have been the greatest, or, if neither the Acquiring Company nor the Parent meets the requirements set forth in subsections (d), (e) and (f) below, at the election of the holder of this Warrant pursuant to notice given to the Company within six months after the Consummation Date, (c) shall be entitled to receive, within 30 days after such election, in full satisfaction of the exercise rights afforded under this Warrant to the holder thereof, an amount equal to the fair market value of such exercise rights as determined by an independent investment banker (with an established national reputation as a valuer of equity securities) selected by the Required Holders with the approval of the Company, such fair market value to be determined with regard to all material relevant factors but without regard to any negative effects on such value of the Transaction, and (Y) in the case of any Transaction other than a Hostile Transaction, shall be entitled to receive upon the exercise hereof at any time prior to the Consummation Date any of the following at the election of the holder of this Warrant made on or prior to the Consummation Date: -10-
(a) the Common Stock issuable upon such exercise; (b) in lieu of each share of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise prior to the Consummation Date, either (i) the greatest amount of cash, securities or other property given to any stockholder in consideration for any share of Common Stock at any time during the period from and after the Announcement Date to and including the Consummation Date by the Acquiring Company, the Company or any Affiliate of either thereof, or (ii) the Market Price per share for the Acquirer's Common Stock, determined as of the day within the period from and after the Announcement Date to and including the Consummation Date for which the amount determined as provided in the definition of Market Price shall have been the greatest; or, if neither the Acquiring Company nor the Parent meets the requirements set forth in subsections (d), (e) and (f) below, (c) in full satisfaction of the exercise rights afforded under this Warrant to the holder thereof, an amount equal to the fair market value of such exercise rights as determined by an independent investment banker (with an established national reputation as a valuer of equity securities) selected by the Required Holders with the approval of the Company, such fair market value to be determined with regard to all material relevant factors. In any election by the holder of this Warrant under subsection (b)(ii) of either of clauses (X) and (Y) of this Section 2I, the number of shares of the Acquirer's Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise or conversion of this Warrant shall be deemed to be such as shall result from adjustments thereto that would have been required if an election had been made under subsection (a) of clause (X) of this Section 2I. The Company agrees to obtain, and deliver to each holder of Warrants a copy of the determination of an independent investment banker (selected by the Required Holders pursuant to subsection (c) of clauses (X) or (Y) above, as applicable) necessary to permit elections under subsection (c) of clauses (X) or (Y) above, as applicable, within 15 days after the Consummation Date of any Transaction to which subsection (c) of clauses (X) or (Y), as applicable, applies. In the case of any Transaction other than a Hostile Transaction, to the extent that the holder of this Warrant shall not already have exercised this Warrant in full at the time immediately prior to the consummation of such Transaction, then the unexercised portion of this Warrant will be deemed to have been exercised at such time and the holder of this Warrant shall be deemed to have elected from subsection (b) of clause (Y). The requirements referred to above applicable to the Acquiring Company or its Parent are that, immediately after the Consummation Date: -11-
(d) it is a solvent corporation organized, under the laws of any state of the United States of America, having its common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange or quoted by the Nasdaq National Market or any successor thereto or comparable system, and such common stock continues to meet the requirements for such listing or quotation, (e) it is required to file, and in each of its three fiscal years immediately preceding the Consummation Date has filed, reports with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and (f) in the case of the Parent, such Parent is required to include the Acquiring Company in the consolidated financial statements contained in the Parent's Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Commission and is not itself included in the consolidated financial statements of any other Person (other than its consolidated subsidiaries). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Company shall not effect any Transaction unless prior to the consummation thereof each corporation or entity (other than the Company) which may be required to deliver any securities or other property upon the exercise of Warrants shall assume, by written instrument delivered to each holder of Warrants, the obligation to deliver to such holder such securities or other property as to which, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such holder may be entitled, and, solely in the case of a Hostile Transaction, such corporation or entity shall have similarly delivered to each holder of Warrants an opinion of counsel for such corporation or entity, satisfactory to each holder of Warrants, which opinion shall state that all the outstanding Warrants shall thereafter continue in full force and effect and shall be enforceable against such corporation or entity in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, and addresses such other matters as such holders may reasonably request. 2J. Certain Issues Excepted. Anything herein to the contrary ----------------------- notwithstanding, the Company shall not be required to make any adjustment of the Exercise Price in the case of (i) the issuance of the Warrants and the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, (ii) any issuance of shares of Common Stock upon the exercise by the holder hereof of the preemptive rights provided in Section 10 of the Stockholders' Agreement or (iii) the issuance of up to 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock upon the purchase thereof by Company employees under an employee stock purchase plan or the exercise of options granted pursuant to stock option plans for employees and directors of the Company, in each case adopted by the Company's board of directors prior to or after the date of this Warrant, provided that if any such options shall expire or terminate, in whole or in part, without having been exercised in full, -12-
the shares of Common Stock not acquired under such options shall be added to the number of shares of Common Stock subject to this clause (iii) (any adjustment or issuance referred to in this Section 2J, a "PERMITTED EVENT"). 2K. Notice of Adjustment. Upon the occurrence of any event ---------------------- requiring an adjustment of the Exercise Price, then and in each such case the Company shall promptly deliver to the holder of this Warrant an Officer's Certificate stating the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment and the increase or decrease, if any, in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant, setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which such calculation is based. 2L. Other Notices. In case at any time: ------------- (a) the Company shall declare to the holders of Common Stock any dividend other than a regular periodic cash dividend or any periodic cash dividend in excess of 115% of the cash dividend for the comparable fiscal period in the immediately preceding fiscal year; (b) the Company shall declare or pay any dividend upon Common Stock payable in stock or make any special dividend or other distribution (other than regular cash dividends) to the holders of Common Stock; (c) the Company shall offer for subscription pro rata to the holders of Common Stock any additional shares of stock of any class or other rights; (d) there shall be any capital reorganization, or reclassification of the capital stock of the Company, or consolidation or merger of the Company with, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets to, another corporation or other entity; (e) there shall be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company; (f) there shall be made any tender offer for any shares of capital stock of the Company; or (g) there shall be any other Transaction; then, in any one or more of such cases, the Company shall give to the holder of this Warrant (i) at least 20 days prior to any event referred to in subsection (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) above, and within 5 days after it has knowledge of any pending tender offer or other Transaction, written notice of the date on which the books of the Company shall close or a record shall be taken for such -13-
dividend, distribution or subscription rights or for determining rights to vote in respect of any such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation, winding-up or Transaction or the date by which stockholders must tender shares in any tender offer and (ii) in the case of any such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation, winding-up or tender offer or Transaction known to the Company, at least 20 days prior written notice of the date (or, if not then known, a reasonable approximation thereof by the Company) when the same shall take place. Such notice in accordance with the foregoing clause (i) shall also specify, in the case of any such dividend, distribution or subscription rights, the date on which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled thereto, and such notice in accordance with the foregoing clause (ii) shall also specify the date on which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation, winding-up, tender offer or Transaction, as the case may be.

Certain Events. If any event occurs as to which the other --------------- provisions of this Warrant are not strictly applicable or if strictly applicable would not fairly protect the exercise rights of the holders of this Warrant in accordance with the essential intent and principles of such provisions, then, notwithstanding any limitation on amendments or other modifications set forth in any of the Transaction Documents to the contrary, the terms of this Warrant shall be adjusted by the Company and the Required Holders on a basis consistent with such essential intent and principles, necessary to preserve, without dilution, the rights of the holders of the Warrants; provided, that no such -------- adjustment shall have the effect of increasing the Exercise Price as otherwise determined pursuant to this Warrant. The Company may make such reductions in the Exercise Price as it deems advisable, including any reductions necessary to ensure that any event treated for federal income tax purposes as a distribution of stock or stock rights not be taxable to recipients. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Warrant, the amount of consideration per share of Common Stock paid upon any exercise of this Warrant (whether such consideration is paid in cash or pursuant to Section 1F) pursuant to Section 1A and after giving effect to the adjustment in the number of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 1B shall not be less than the then applicable par value of the Common Stock; provided that, in the event the consideration per share of Common Stock -------- paid upon exercise of this Warrant shall be higher as a result of the application of this sentence (the extent to which such consideration per share is higher multiplied by the number of shares for which this Warrant is then -------------- exercisable being referred to as the "ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION"), then the number of shares for which this Warrant is then exercisable shall automatically be increased such that the value of such additional shares, net of the par value required to be paid therefor, shall equal the value of the Additional Consideration. -14-
2N. Prohibition of Certain Actions. The Company will not, by --------------------------------- amendment of its certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Company, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Warrant and in the taking of all such action as may reasonably be requested by the holder of this Warrant in order to protect the exercise privilege of the holder of this Warrant against dilution or other impairment, consistent with the tenor and purpose of this Warrant. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company (a) will not increase the par value of any shares of Common Stock receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant above the Exercise Price then in effect, (b) will take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of all Warrants from time to time outstanding, (c) will not take any action which results in any adjustment of the Exercise Price if the total number of shares of Common Stock or Other Securities issuable after the action upon the exercise of all of the Warrants would exceed the total number of shares of Common Stock or Other Securities then authorized by the Company's certificate of incorporation and available for the purpose of issue upon such conversion, and (d) will not issue any capital stock of any class which has the right to more than one vote per share or any capital stock of any class which is preferred as to dividends or as to the distribution of assets upon voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up, unless the rights of the holders thereof shall be limited to a fixed sum or percentage (or floating rate related to market yields) of par value or stated value in respect of participation in dividends and a fixed sum or percentage of par value or stated value in any such distribution of assets. SECTION 3. STOCK TO BE RESERVED. The Company will at all times reserve and keep available out of the authorized Common Stock, solely for the purpose of issue upon the exercise of the Warrants as herein provided, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall then be issuable upon the exercise of all outstanding Warrants, and the Company will maintain at all times all other rights and privileges sufficient to enable it to fulfill all its obligations hereunder. The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock which shall be so issuable shall, upon issuance, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, free from preemptive or similar rights on the part of the holders of any shares of capital stock or securities of the Company or any other Person, and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof (not including any income taxes payable by the holders of Warrants being exercised in respect of gains thereon), and the Exercise Price will be credited to the capital and surplus of the Company. The Company will take all such action as may be necessary to assure that such shares of Common Stock may be so issued without violation of any applicable law or regulation, or of any applicable requirements of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and of any domestic securities exchange upon which the Common Stock may be listed. -15-
SECTION 4. REGISTRATION OF COMMON STOCK. If any shares of Common Stock required to be reserved for purposes of the exercise of Warrants require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law (other than the Securities Act, registration under which is governed by the Stockholders' Agreement), before such shares may be issued upon the exercise thereof, the Company will, at its expense and as expeditiously as possible, use its best efforts to cause such shares to be duly registered or approved, as the case may be. Shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants shall be registered by the Company under the Securities Act or similar statute then in force if required by the Stockholders' Agreement and subject to the conditions stated in such agreement. At any such time as the Common Stock is listed on any national securities exchange or quoted by the Nasdaq National Market or any successor thereto or any comparable system, the Company will, at its expense, obtain promptly and maintain the approval for the listing on each such exchange or the quoting by the Nasdaq National Market or such successor thereto or comparable system, upon official notice of issuance, of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the then outstanding Warrants and maintain the listing or quoting of such shares after their issuance so long as the Common Stock is so listed or quoted; and the Company will also cause to be so listed or quoted, will maintain such listing or quoting of and will obtain any required registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law (other than the Securities Act, registration under which is governed by the Stockholders' Agreement) with respect to any Other Securities that at any time are issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, if and at the time that any securities of the same class shall be listed on such national securities exchange by the Company.

No provision of this Warrant, in the absence of the actual exercise of such Warrant and receipt by the holder thereof of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, shall give rise to any liability on the part of such holder as a stockholder of the Company, whether such liability shall be asserted by the Company or by creditors of the Company.

AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION. The Company will cooperate with each holder of any Restricted Securities in supplying such information as may be necessary for such holder to complete and file any information-reporting forms presently or hereafter required by the Commission as a condition to the availability of an exemption from the Securities Act for the sale of any Restricted Securities. The Company will furnish to each registered holder of any Warrants, promptly upon their becoming available, copies of all financial statements, reports, notices and proxy statements sent or made available generally by the Company to its stockholders, and copies of all regular and periodic reports filed by the Company with any securities exchange or with the Commission.

The Advance Rates may be increased or -------------------- decreased by Agent at any time and from time to time in the exercise of its reasonable discretion. Each Borrower consents to any such increases or decreases and acknowledges that decreasing the Advance Rates or increasing the reserves may limit or restrict Advances requested by Borrowing Agent. Agent shall give Borrowing Agent five (5) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to decrease the Advance Rates. 2.2. Procedure for Borrowing Advances. -------------------------------- (a) Borrowing Agent on behalf of any Borrower may notify Agent prior to 1:00 p.m. New York time on a Business Day of a Borrower's request to incur, on that day, a Revolving Advance hereunder. Should any amount required to be paid as interest hereunder, or as fees or other charges under this Agreement or any other agreement with Agent or Lenders, or with respect to any other Obligation, become due, same shall be deemed a request for a Revolving Advance as of the date such payment is due, in the amount required to pay in full such interest, fee, charge or Obligation under this Agreement or any other agreement with Agent or Lenders, and such request shall be irrevocable. (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of (a) above, in the event any Borrower desires to obtain a Eurodollar Rate Loan, Borrowing Agent shall give Agent at least three (3) Business Days' prior written notice, specifying (i) the date of the proposed borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), (ii) the type of borrowing and the amount on the date of such Advance to be borrowed, which amount shall be in a minimum amount of $1,000,000 and in integral multiples of $500,000 in addition thereto, and (iii) the duration of the first Interest Period therefor. Interest Periods for Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be for one, two, three or six months; provided, if an Interest Period would end on a day -------- that is not a Business Day, it shall end on the next succeeding Business Day unless such day falls in the next succeeding calendar month in which case the Interest Period shall end on the next preceding Business Day. No Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be made available to Borrower during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default. (c) Each Interest Period of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall commence on the 21
date such Eurodollar Rate Loan is made and shall end on such date as Borrowing Agent may elect as set forth in subsection (b)(iii) above provided that the exact length of each Interest Period shall be determined in accordance with the practice of the interbank market for offshore Dollar deposits and no Interest Period shall end after the last day of the Term. Borrowing Agent shall elect the initial Interest Period applicable to a Eurodollar Rate Loan by its notice of borrowing given to Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or by its notice of conversion given to Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(d), as the case may be. Borrowing Agent shall elect the duration of each succeeding Interest Period by giving irrevocable written notice to Agent of such duration not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loan. If Agent does not receive timely notice of the Interest Period elected by Borrowing Agent, Borrowers shall be deemed to have elected to convert to a Domestic Rate Loan subject to Section 2.2(d) hereinbelow. (d) Provided that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, any Borrower may, on the last Business Day of the then current Interest Period applicable to any outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loan, or on any Business Day with respect to Domestic Rate Loans, convert any such loan into a loan of another type in the same aggregate principal amount provided that any conversion of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be made only on the last Business Day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loan. If a Borrower desires to convert a loan, Borrowing Agent shall give Agent not less than three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to convert from a Domestic Rate Loan to a Eurodollar Rate Loan or one (1) Business Day's prior written notice to convert from a Eurodollar Rate Loan to a Domestic Rate Loan, specifying the date of such conversion, the loans to be converted and if the conversion is from a Domestic Rate Loan to any other type of loan, the duration of the first Interest Period therefor. After giving effect to each such conversion, there shall not be outstanding more than five (5) Eurodollar Rate Loans, in the aggregate. (e) At its option and upon three (3) Business Days' prior written notice, any Borrower may prepay any Eurodollar Rate Loans in whole at any time or in part from time to time, without premium or penalty, but with accrued interest on the principal being prepaid to the date of such repayment. Such Borrower shall specify the date of prepayment of Advances which are Eurodollar Rate Loans and the amount of such prepayment. In the event that any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan is required or permitted on a date other than the last Business Day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, Borrowers shall indemnify Agent and Lenders therefor in accordance with Section 2.2(f) hereof. (f) Each Borrower shall indemnify Agent and Lenders and hold Agent and Lenders harmless from and against any and all losses or expenses that Agent and Lenders may sustain or incur as a consequence of any prepayment, conversion of or any default by any Borrower in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Eurodollar Rate Loan or failure by any Borrower to complete a borrowing of, a prepayment of or conversion of or to a Eurodollar Rate Loan after notice thereof has been given, including, but not limited to, any interest payable by Agent or Lenders to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make or maintain its Eurodollar Rate Loans hereunder. For purposes of this Section, it shall be assumed that Agent or 22
Lenders had obtained funds from such lenders of funds in order to make or maintain its Eurodollar Rate Loans hereunder, for a corresponding amount and term. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted by Agent or any Lender to Borrowing Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (g) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if any applicable law, treaty, regulation or directive, or any change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof, shall make it unlawful for any Lender (for purposes of this subsection (g), the term "Lender" shall include any Lender and the office or branch where any Lender or any corporation or bank controlling such Lender makes or maintains any Eurodollar Rate Loans) to make or maintain its Eurodollar Rate Loans, the obligation of Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate Loans hereunder shall forthwith be cancelled and Borrowers shall, if any affected Eurodollar Rate Loans are then outstanding, promptly upon request from Agent, either pay all such affected Eurodollar Rate Loans or convert such affected Eurodollar Rate Loans into loans of another type. If any such payment or conversion of any Eurodollar Rate Loan is made on a day that is not the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loan, Borrowers shall pay Agent, upon Agent's request, such amount or amounts as may be necessary to compensate Lenders for any loss or expense sustained or incurred by Lenders in respect of such Eurodollar Rate Loan as a result of such payment or conversion, including (but not limited to) any interest or other amounts payable by Lenders to lenders of funds obtained by Lenders in order to make or maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loan. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted by Lenders to Borrowing Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 2.3. Disbursement of Advance Proceeds. All Advances shall be disbursed -------------------------------- from whichever office or other place Agent may designate from time to time and, together with any and all other Obligations of Borrowers to Agent or Lenders, shall be charged to Borrowers' Account on Agent's books. During the Term, Borrowers may use the Revolving Advances by borrowing, prepaying and reborrowing, all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. The proceeds of each Revolving Advance requested by Borrowers or deemed to have been requested by Borrowers under Section 2.2(a) hereof shall, with respect to requested Revolving Advances to the extent Lenders make such Revolving Advances, be made available to the applicable Borrower on the day so requested by way of credit to such Borrower's operating account at PNC, or such other bank as Borrowing Agent may designate following notification to Agent, in immediately available federal funds or other immediately available funds or, with respect to Revolving Advances deemed to have been requested by any Borrower, be disbursed to Agent to be applied to the outstanding Obligations giving rise to such deemed request. 2.4. Maximum Advances. The aggregate balance of Revolving Advances ---------------- outstanding at any time shall not exceed the lesser of (a) Maximum Revolving Advance Amount less the aggregate undrawn amount of outstanding Letters of Credit or (b) the Formula Amount less the aggregate undrawn amount of outstanding Letters of Credit. 2.5. Repayment of Advances. --------------------- (a) The Revolving Advances shall be due and payable in full on the last day of the Term subject to earlier prepayment as herein provided. 23
(b) Each Borrower recognizes that the amounts evidenced by checks, notes, drafts or any other items of payment relating to and/or proceeds of Collateral may not be collectible by Agent on the date received. In consideration of Agent's agreement to conditionally credit Borrowers' Account as of the Business Day on which Agent receives those items of payment, each Borrower agrees that, in computing the charges under this Agreement, all items of payment shall be deemed applied by Agent on account of the Obligations one (1) Business Day after the Business Day Agent receives such payments via wire transfer or electronic depository check. Agent is not, however, required to credit Borrowers' Account for the amount of any item of payment which is unsatisfactory to Agent and Agent may charge Borrowers' Account for the amount of any item of payment which is returned to Agent unpaid. (c) All payments of principal, interest and other amounts payable hereunder, or under any of the Other Documents shall be made to Agent at the Payment Office not later than 1:00 P.M. (New York Time) on the due date therefor in lawful money of the United States of America in federal funds or other funds immediately available to Agent. Agent shall have the right to effectuate payment on any and all Obligations due and owing hereunder by charging Borrowers' Account or by making Advances as provided in Section 2.2 hereof. (d) Borrowers shall pay principal, interest, and all other amounts payable hereunder, or under any related agreement, without any deduction whatsoever, including, but not limited to, any deduction for any setoff or counterclaim. 2.6. Repayment of Excess Advances. The aggregate balance of Advances ---------------------------- outstanding at any time in excess of the maximum amount of Advances permitted hereunder shall be immediately due and payable without the necessity of any demand, at the Payment Office, whether or not a Default or Event of Default has occurred. 2.7. Statement of Account. Agent shall maintain, in accordance with -------------------- its customary procedures, a loan account ("Borrowers' Account") in the name of Borrowers in which shall be recorded the date and amount of each Advance made by Agent and the date and amount of each payment in respect thereof; provided, -------- however, the failure by Agent to record the date and amount of any Advance shall - ------- not adversely affect Agent or any Lender. Each month, Agent shall send to Borrowing Agent a statement showing the accounting for the Advances made, payments made or credited in respect thereof, and other transactions between Agent and Borrowers, during such month. The monthly statements shall be deemed correct and binding upon Borrowers in the absence of manifest error and shall constitute an account stated between Lenders and Borrowers unless Agent receives a written statement of Borrowers' specific exceptions thereto within thirty (30) days after such statement is received by Borrowing Agent. The records of Agent with respect to the loan account shall be conclusive evidence absent manifest error of the amounts of Advances and other charges thereto and of payments applicable thereto. 2.8. Letters of Credit. ----------------- 24
2.8.1. Letter of Credit Facility. Subject to the terms and ------------------------- conditions hereof, Agent shall (a) issue or cause the issuance of Letters of Credit ("Letters of Credit") on behalf of any Borrower; provided, however, that -------- ------- Agent will not be required to issue or cause to be issued any Letters of Credit to the extent that the face amount of such Letters of Credit would then cause the sum of (i) the outstanding Revolving Advances plus (ii) outstanding Letters ---- of Credit to exceed the lesser of (x) the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount or (y) the Formula Amount. The maximum amount of outstanding Letters of Credit shall not exceed $2,500,000 in the aggregate at any time. All disbursements or payments related to Letters of Credit shall be deemed to be Domestic Rate Loans consisting of Revolving Advances and shall bear interest at the applicable Revolving Interest Rate for Domestic Rate Loans; Letters of Credit that have not been drawn upon shall not bear interest. 2.8.2. Issuance of Letters of Credit. ----------------------------- (a) Borrowing Agent, on behalf of Borrowers, may request Agent to issue or cause the issuance of a Letter of Credit by delivering to Agent at the Payment Office, Agent's form of Letter of Credit Application (the "Letter of Credit Application") completed to the satisfaction of Agent at least three (3) Business Days, or such shorter period as may be agreed to by Agent, in advance of the proposed date of issuance; and, such other certificates, documents and other papers and information as Agent may reasonably request. Borrowing Agent, on behalf of Borrowers, also has the right to give instructions and make agreements with respect to any application, any applicable letter of credit and security agreement, any applicable letter of credit reimbursement agreement and/or any other applicable agreement, any letter of credit and the disposition of documents, disposition of any unutilized funds, and to agree with Agent upon any amendment, extension or renewal of any Letter of Credit.

expense or liability, including, without limitation, payments made by Agent, any Lender or any Issuer and expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by Agent, any Lender or Issuer arising out of, or in connection with, any Letter of Credit to be issued or created for any Borrower. Borrowers shall be bound by Agent's or any Issuer's regulations and good faith interpretations of any Letter of Credit issued or created for Borrowers' Account, although this interpretation may be different from its own; and, neither Agent, nor any Lender, nor any Issuer nor any of their correspondents shall be liable for any error, negligence, or mistakes, whether of omission or commission, in following Borrowing Agent's or any Borrower's instructions or those contained in any Letter of Credit or of any modifications, amendments or supplements thereto or in issuing or paying any Letter of Credit, except for Agent's, any Lender's, any Issuer's or such correspondents' willful misconduct. (b) Borrowing Agent shall authorize and direct any Issuer to name the applicable Borrower as the "Applicant" or "Account Party" of each Letter of Credit. If Agent is not the Issuer of any Letter of Credit, Borrowing Agent shall authorize and direct the Issuer to deliver to Agent all instruments, documents, and other writings and property received by the Issuer pursuant to the Letter of Credit and to accept and rely upon Agent's instructions and agreements with respect to all matters arising in connection with the Letter of Credit, the application therefor or any acceptance therefor. (c) In connection with all Letters of Credit issued or caused to be issued by Agent under this Agreement, each Borrower hereby appoints Agent, or its designee, as its attorney, with full power and authority (i) to sign and/or endorse such Borrower's name upon any warehouse or other receipts, letter of credit applications and acceptances; (ii) to sign such Borrower's name on bills of lading; (iii) to clear Inventory through the United States of America Customs Department ("Customs") in the name of such Borrower or Agent or Agent's designee, and to sign and deliver to Customs officials powers of attorney in the name of such Borrower for such purpose; and (iv) to complete in such Borrower's name or Agent's, or in the name of Agent's designee, any order, sale or transaction, obtain the necessary documents in connection therewith, and collect the proceeds thereof. Neither Agent nor its attorneys will be liable for any acts or omissions nor for any error of judgment or mistakes of fact or law, except for Agent's or its attorney's willful misconduct. This power, being coupled with an interest, is irrevocable as long as any Letters of Credit remain outstanding. 2.8.4. Disbursements, Reimbursement. ---------------------------- (a) Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Agent a participation in such Letter of Credit and each drawing thereunder in an amount equal to such Lender's Commitment Percentages of the maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit and the amount of such drawing, respectively. (b) In the event of any request for a drawing under a Letter of Credit by the beneficiary or transferee thereof, the Agent will promptly notify Borrowers. Provided that it shall have received such notice, Borrowers shall reimburse (such obligation to reimburse the Agent shall sometimes be referred to as a "Reimbursement Obligation") the Agent prior to 12:00 26
noon, New York time on each date that an amount is paid by the Agent under any Letter of Credit (each such date, a "Drawing Date") in an amount equal to the amount so paid by the Agent. In the event the Borrower fails to reimburse the Agent for the full amount of any drawing under any Letter of Credit by 12:00 noon, New York time, on the Drawing Date, the Agent will promptly notify each Lender thereof, and Borrowers shall be deemed to have requested that a Domestic Rate Loan be made by the Lenders to be disbursed on the Drawing Date under such Letter of Credit, subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the lesser of Maximum Revolving Advance Amount or the Formula Amount and subject to Section 8.2. Any notice given by the Agent pursuant to this Section 2.8.4(b) may be oral if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. (c) Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.8.4(b) make available to the Agent an amount in immediately available funds equal to its Commitment Percentage of the amount of the drawing, whereupon the participating Lenders shall (subject to Section 2.8.4(d)) each be deemed to have made a Domestic Rate Loan to Borrowers in that amount. If any Lender so notified fails to make available to the Agent the amount of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such amount by no later than 2:00 p.m., New York time on the Drawing Date, then interest shall accrue on such Lender's obligation to make such payment, from the Drawing Date to the date on which such Lender makes such payment (i) at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate during the first three days following the Drawing Date and (ii) at a rate per annum equal to the rate applicable to Domestic Rate Loans on and after the fourth day following the Drawing Date. The Agent will promptly give notice of the occurrence of the Drawing Date, but failure of the Agent to give any such notice on the Drawing Date or in sufficient time to enable any Lender to effect such payment on such date shall not relieve such Lender from its obligation under this Section 2.8.4(c), provided that such Lender shall not be obligated to pay interest as provided in Section 2.8.4 (c) (i) and (ii) until and commencing from the date of receipt of notice from Agent of a drawing. Each Lender's participation commitment shall continue until the last to occur of any of the following events: (A) Agent ceases to be obligated to issue or cause to be issued Letters of Credit hereunder; (B) no Letter of Credit issued or created hereunder remains outstanding and uncancelled or (C) all Persons (other than the applicable Borrower) have been fully reimbursed for all payments made under or relating to Letters of Credit. (d) With respect to any unreimbursed drawing that is not converted into a Domestic Rate Loan to Borrowers in whole or in part as contemplated by Section 2.8.4(b), because of the Borrowers' failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 8.2 other than any notice requirements or for any other reason, Borrowers shall be deemed to have incurred from the Agent a borrowing (each a "Letter of Credit Borrowing") in the amount of such drawing. Such Letter of Credit Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the rate per annum applicable to a Domestic Rate Loan. Each Lender's payment to the Agent pursuant to Section 2.8.4(c) shall be deemed to be a payment in respect of its participation in such Letter of Credit Borrowing and shall constitute a "Participation Advance" from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.8.4. 27
2.8.5. Repayment of Participation Advances. ----------------------------------- (a) Upon (and only upon) receipt by the Agent for its account of immediately available funds from Borrowers (i) in reimbursement of any payment made by the Agent under the Letter of Credit with respect to which any Lender has made a Participation Advance to the Agent, or (ii) in payment of interest on such a payment made by the Agent under such a Letter of Credit, the Agent will pay to each Lender, in the same funds as those received by the Agent, the amount of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such funds, except the Agent shall retain the amount of the Commitment Percentage of such funds of any Lender that did not make a Participation Advance in respect of such payment by Agent. (b) If the Agent is required at any time to return to any Borrower, or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian, or any official in any insolvency proceeding, any portion of the payments made by any Borrower to the Agent pursuant to Section 2.8.5(a) in reimbursement of a payment made under the Letter of Credit or interest or fee thereon, each Lender shall, on demand of the Agent, forthwith return to the Agent the amount of its Commitment Percentage of any amounts so returned by the Agent. 2.8.6. Documentation. Each Borrower agrees to be bound by the ------------- terms of the Letter of Credit Application and the Agent's written regulations and customary practices relating to letters of credit, though the Agent's interpretation of such regulations and practices may be different from such Borrower's own. In the event of a conflict between the Letter of Credit Application and this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern. It is understood and agreed that, except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct, the Agent shall not be liable for any error, negligence and/or mistakes, whether of omission or commission, in following any Borrower's instructions or those contained in the Letters of Credit or any modifications, amendments or supplements thereto. 2.8.7. Determination to Honor Drawing Request. In determining -------------------------------------- whether to honor any request for drawing under any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof, the Agent shall be responsible only to determine that the documents and certificates required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit have been delivered and that they comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter of Credit. 2.8.8. Nature of Participation and Reimbursement Obligations. ----------------------------------------------------- Each Lender's obligation in accordance with this Agreement to make the Revolving Advances or Participation Advances as a result of a drawing under a Letter of Credit, and the obligations of the Borrowers to reimburse the Agent upon a draw under a Letter of Credit, shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.8.8 under all circumstances, including the following circumstances: (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Agent, Borrowers or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the failure of any Borrower or any other Person to comply, in 28
connection with a Letter of Credit Borrowing, with the conditions set forth in this Agreement for the making of a Revolving Advance, it being acknowledged that such conditions are not required for the making of a Letter of Credit Borrowing and the obligation of the Lenders to make Participation Advances under Section 2.8.4; (iii) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit; (iv) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right which any Borrower or any Lender may have at any time against a beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Persons for whom any such transferee may be acting), the Agent or any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transaction (including any underlying transaction between any Borrower or Subsidiaries of a Borrower and the beneficiary for which any Letter of Credit was procured); (v) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, even if the Agent has been notified thereof; (vi) payment by the Agent under any Letter of Credit against presentation of a demand, draft or certificate or other document which does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit other than as a result of the gross (not mere) negligence or willful misconduct of Agent; (vii) any Material Adverse Effect on any Borrower or any Guarantor; (viii) any breach of this Agreement or any Other Document by any party thereto; (ix) the occurrence or continuance of an insolvency proceeding with respect to any Borrower or any Guarantor; (x) the fact that a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; (xi) the fact that the Term shall have expired or this Agreement or the Obligations hereunder shall have been terminated; and (xii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing. 2.8.9. Liability for Acts and Omissions. As between any Borrower -------------------------------- and the Agent and Lenders, such Borrower assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit by, the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the respective foregoing, the Agent shall not be responsible for: (i) the 29
form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection with the application for an issuance of any such Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged (even if the Agent shall have been notified thereof); (ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) the failure of the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit, or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred, to comply fully with any conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit or any other claim of any Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit, or any such transferee, or any dispute between or among any Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any such transferee; (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any such Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of the Agent, including any governmental acts, and none of the above shall affect or impair, or prevent the vesting of, any of the Agent's rights or powers hereunder. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall relieve the Agent from liability for the Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with actions or omissions described in such clauses (i) through (viii) of such sentence. In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific provisions set forth above, any action taken or omitted by the Agent under or in connection with the Letters of Credit issued by it or any documents and certificates delivered thereunder, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put the Agent under any resulting liability to any Borrower or any Lender. 2.9. Additional Payments. Any sums expended by Agent or any Lender due ------------------- to any Borrower's failure to perform or comply with its obligations under this Agreement or any Other Document including, without limitation, any Borrower's obligations under Sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.12, 4.13, 4.14 and 6.1 hereof, may be charged to Borrowers' Account as a Revolving Advance and added to the Obligations. 2.10. Manner of Borrowing and Payment. ------------------------------- (a) Each borrowing of Revolving Advances shall be advanced according to the applicable Commitment Percentages of Lenders. (b) Each payment (including each prepayment) by Borrowers on account of the principal of and interest on the Revolving Advances, shall be applied to the Revolving Advances pro rata according to the applicable Commitment Percentages of Lenders. Except as expressly provided herein, all payments (including prepayments) to be made by any Borrower on account of principal, interest and fees shall be made without set off or counterclaim and shall be made to Agent on behalf of the Lenders to the Payment Office, in each case on or prior to 1:00 P.M., New York time, in Dollars and in immediately available funds. 30
(c) (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Sections 2.10(a) and (b) hereof, commencing with the first Business Day following the Closing Date, each borrowing of Revolving Advances shall be advanced by Agent and each payment by any Borrower on account of Revolving Advances shall be applied first to those Revolving Advances advanced by Agent. On or before 1:00 P.M., New York time, on each Settlement Date commencing with the first Settlement Date following the Closing Date, Agent and Lenders shall make certain payments as follows: (I) if the aggregate amount of new Revolving Advances made by Agent during the preceding Week (if any) exceeds the aggregate amount of repayments applied to outstanding Revolving Advances during such preceding Week, then each Lender shall provide Agent with funds in an amount equal to its applicable Commitment Percentage of the difference between (w) such Revolving Advances and (x) such repayments and (II) if the aggregate amount of repayments applied to outstanding Revolving Advances during such Week exceeds the aggregate amount of new Revolving Advances made during such Week, then Agent shall provide each Lender with funds in an amount equal to its applicable Commitment Percentage of the difference between (y) such repayments and (z) such Revolving Advances. (ii) Each Lender shall be entitled to earn interest at the applicable Revolving Interest Rate on outstanding Advances which it has funded. (iii) Promptly following each Settlement Date, Agent shall submit to each Lender a certificate with respect to payments received and Advances made during the Week immediately preceding such Settlement Date. Such certificate of Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. (d) If any Lender or Participant (a "benefitted Lender") shall at any time receive any payment of all or part of its Advances, or interest thereon, or receive any Collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily or by set-off) in a greater proportion than any such payment to and Collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of such other Lender's Advances, or interest thereon, and such greater proportionate payment or receipt of Collateral is not expressly permitted hereunder, such benefitted Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participation in such portion of each such other Lender's Advances, or shall provide such other Lender with the benefits of any such Collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such benefitted Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such Collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the other Lenders; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits - -------- ------- is thereafter recovered from such benefitted Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. Each Lender so purchasing a portion of another Lender's Advances may exercise all rights of payment (including, without limitation, rights of set-off) with respect to such portion as fully as if such Lender were the direct holder of such portion. (e) Unless Agent shall have been notified by telephone, confirmed in writing, by any Lender that such Lender will not make the amount which would constitute its applicable Commitment Percentage of the Advances available to Agent, Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) assume that such Lender shall make such amount available to Agent on the next 31
Settlement Date and, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrowers a corresponding amount. Agent will promptly notify Borrowers of its receipt of any such notice from a Lender. If such amount is made available to Agent on a date after such next Settlement Date, such Lender shall pay to Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the daily average Federal Funds Rate (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days) during such period as quoted by Agent, times (ii) such amount, times (iii) the number of days from and including such Settlement Date to the date on which such amount becomes immediately available to Agent. A certificate of Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph (e) shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error. If such amount is not in fact made available to Agent by such Lender within three (3) Business Days after such Settlement Date, Agent shall be entitled to recover such an amount, with interest thereon at the rate per annum then applicable to such Revolving Advances hereunder, on demand from Borrowers; provided, however, that Agent's right to such recovery -------- ------- shall not prejudice or otherwise adversely affect Borrowers' rights (if any) against such Lender. 2.11. Mandatory Prepayments. --------------------- Subject to Section 4.3 hereof, when any Borrower sells or otherwise disposes of any Collateral other than Inventory in the ordinary course of business, Borrowers shall repay the Advances in an amount equal to the net proceeds of such sale (i.e., gross proceeds less the reasonable costs of such sales or other dispositions), such repayments to be made promptly but in no event more than one (1) Business Day following receipt of such net proceeds, and until the date of payment, such proceeds shall be held in trust for Agent. The foregoing shall not be deemed to be implied consent to any such sale otherwise prohibited by the terms and conditions hereof. Such repayments shall be applied to the outstanding Advances in such order as Agent may determine, subject to Borrower's ability to reborrow Revolving Advances in accordance with the terms hereof. 2.12. Use of Proceeds. Borrowers shall apply the proceeds of Advances to --------------- (i) fund in part the acquisition of RHM under the Acquisition Agreement, (ii) repay existing indebtedness owed to PNC, (iii) pay fees and expenses relating to the Transactions, and (iv) to provide for their working capital needs. 2.13. Defaulting Lender. ----------------- (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event any Lender (x) has refused (which refusal constitutes a breach by such Lender of its obligations under this Agreement) to make available its portion of any Advance or (y) notifies either Agent or Borrowing Agent that it does not intend to make available its portion of any Advance (if the actual refusal would constitute a breach by such Lender of its obligations under this Agreement) (each, a "Lender Default"), all rights and obligations hereunder of such Lender (a "Defaulting Lender") as to which a Lender Default is in effect and of the other parties hereto shall be modified to the extent of the express provisions of this Section 2.13 while such Lender Default remains in effect. (b) Advances shall be incurred pro rata from Lenders (the "Non-Defaulting 32
Lenders") which are not Defaulting Lenders based on their respective Commitment Percentages, and no Commitment Percentage of any Lender or any pro rata share of any Advances required to be advanced by any Lender shall be increased as a result of such Lender Default. Amounts received in respect of principal of any type of Advances shall be applied to reduce the applicable Advances of each Lender pro rata based on the aggregate of the outstanding Advances of that type of all Lenders at the time of such application; provided, that, such amount shall not be applied to any Advances of a Defaulting Lender at any time when, and to the extent that, the aggregate amount of Advances of any Non-Defaulting Lender exceeds such Non-Defaulting Lender's Commitment Percentage of all Advances then outstanding. (c) A Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to give instructions to Agent or to approve, disapprove, consent to or vote on any matters relating to this Agreement and the Other Documents. All amendments, waivers and other modifications of this Agreement and the Other Documents may be made without regard to a Defaulting Lender and, for purposes of the definition of "Required Lenders", a Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a Lender and not to have Advances outstanding. (d) Other than as expressly set forth in this Section 2.13, the rights and obligations of a Defaulting Lender (including the obligation to indemnify Agent) and the other parties hereto shall remain unchanged. Nothing in this Section 2.13 shall be deemed to release any Defaulting Lender from its obligations under this Agreement and the Other Documents, shall alter such obligations, shall operate as a waiver of any default by such Defaulting Lender hereunder, or shall prejudice any rights which any Borrower, Agent or any Lender may have against any Defaulting Lender as a result of any default by such Defaulting Lender hereunder. (e) In the event a Defaulting Lender retroactively cures to the satisfaction of Agent the breach which caused a Lender to become a Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender shall no longer be a Defaulting Lender and shall be treated as a Lender under this Agreement. III. INTEREST AND FEES. ----------------- 3.1. Interest. Interest on Advances shall be payable in arrears on the -------- first day of each month with respect to Domestic Rate Loans and, with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, at the end of each Interest Period. Interest charges shall be computed on the actual principal amount of Advances outstanding during the month at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Revolving Interest Rate. Whenever, subsequent to the date of this Agreement, the Alternate Base Rate is increased or decreased, the applicable Revolving Interest Rate for Domestic Rate Loans shall be similarly changed without notice or demand of any kind by an amount equal to the amount of such change in the Alternate Base Rate during the time such change or changes remain in effect. The Eurodollar Rate shall be adjusted with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans without notice or demand of any kind on the effective date of any change in the Reserve Percentage as of such effective date. Upon and after the occurrence of an Event of Default, and during the continuation thereof, the Obligations may, at Agent's option, and shall, at the direction of Required Lenders, bear interest at the applicable Revolving Interest Rate for Domestic Loans plus two percent (2%) per annum (the "Default Rate"). 33
3.2. Letter of Credit Fees. --------------------- (a) Borrowers shall pay (x) to Agent, for the benefit of Lenders, fees for each Letter of Credit for the period from and excluding the date of issuance of same to and including the date of expiration or termination, equal to the average daily face amount of each outstanding Letter of Credit multiplied by the difference of (i) the then Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Rate Loans per annum minus (ii) .25%, such fees to be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed and to be payable monthly in arrears on the first day of each month and on the last day of the Term and (y) to the Issuer, fees for each Letter of Credit for the period from and excluding the date of issuance of same to and including the date of expiration or termination, equal to the average daily face amount of each outstanding Letter of Credit multiplied by .25%, such fees to be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed and to be payable monthly in arrears on the first day of each month and on the last day of the Term and any and all fees and expenses as agreed upon by the Issuer and the Borrowing Agent in connection with any Letter of Credit, including, without limitation, in connection with the opening, amendment or renewal of any such Letter of Credit and any acceptances created thereunder and shall reimburse Agent for any and all fees and expenses, if any, paid by Agent to the Issuer and (z) to the Agent for the Agent's sole account the Agent's then in effect customary fees and administrative expenses payable with respect to Letters of Credit as the Agent may generally charge or incur from time to time in connection with the issuance, maintenance, modification (if any), assignment or transfer (if any), negotiation and administration of Letters of Credit (all of the foregoing fees, the "Letter of Credit Fees"). All such charges shall be deemed earned in full on the date when the same are due and payable hereunder and shall not be subject to rebate or proration upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason. Any such charge in effect at the time of a particular transaction shall be the charge for that transaction, notwithstanding any subsequent change in the Issuer's prevailing charges for that type of transaction. All Letter of Credit Fees payable hereunder shall be deemed earned in full on the date when the same are due and payable hereunder and shall not be subject to rebate or proration upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason. Upon and after the occurrence of an Event of Default, and during the continuation thereof, the Letter of Credit Fees may, at Agent's option, and shall, at the direction of Required Lenders, be increased by an additional two percent (2%) per annum. On demand, Borrowers will cause cash to be deposited and maintained in an account with Agent, as cash collateral, in an amount equal to one hundred and five percent (105%) of the outstanding Letters of Credit, and each Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes Agent, in its discretion, on such Borrower's behalf and in such Borrower's name, to open such an account and to make and maintain deposits therein, or in an account opened by such Borrower, in the amounts required hereunder, out of the proceeds of Receivables or other Collateral or out of any other funds of such Borrower coming into any Lender's possession at any time. Agent will invest such cash collateral (less applicable reserves) in such short-term money-market items as to which Agent and such Borrower mutually agree and the net return on such investments shall be credited to such account and constitute additional cash collateral. No Borrower may withdraw amounts credited to any such account except upon payment and performance in full of all Obligations and termination of this Agreement. 34
3.3. Facility Fee. If, for any fiscal quarter during the Term, the ------------ average daily unpaid balance of the Revolving Advances for each day of such fiscal quarter does not equal the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount, then Borrowers shall pay to Agent for the ratable benefit of Lenders a fee at a rate equal to one quarter of one percent (.25%) per annum on the amount by which the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount exceeds such average daily unpaid balance. Such fee shall be payable to Agent in arrears on the first day of each fiscal quarter with respect to the immediately preceding fiscal quarter. 3.4. Intentionally Omitted. --------------------- 3.5. Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest and fees hereunder shall -------------------------------- be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and for the actual number of days elapsed. If any payment to be made hereunder becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and interest thereon shall be payable at the applicable Revolving Interest Rate for Domestic Rate Loans during such extension. 3.6. Maximum Charges. In no event whatsoever shall interest and other --------------- charges charged hereunder exceed the highest rate permissible under law. In the event interest and other charges as computed hereunder would otherwise exceed the highest rate permitted under law, such excess amount shall be first applied to any unpaid principal balance owed by Borrowers, and if the then remaining excess amount is greater than the previously unpaid principal balance, Lenders shall promptly refund such excess amount to Borrowers and the provisions hereof shall be deemed amended to provide for such permissible rate. 3.7. Increased Costs. In the event that any applicable law, treaty or --------------- governmental regulation, or any change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof, or compliance by any Lender (for purposes of this Section 3.7, the term "Lender" shall include Agent or any Lender and any corporation or bank controlling Agent or any Lender) and the office or branch where Agent or any Lender (as so defined) makes or maintains any Eurodollar Rate Loans with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other financial, monetary or other authority, shall: (a) subject Agent or any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or any Other Document or change the basis of taxation of payments to Agent or any Lender of principal, fees, interest or any other amount payable hereunder or under any Other Documents (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of Agent or any Lender by the jurisdiction in which it maintains its principal office); (b) impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, assessment or similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits in or for the account of, advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, any office of Agent or any Lender, including (without limitation) pursuant to Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; or 35
(c) impose on Agent or any Lender or the London interbank Eurodollar market any other condition with respect to this Agreement or any Other Document; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to Agent or any Lender of making, renewing or maintaining its Advances hereunder by an amount that Agent or such Lender deems to be material or to reduce the amount of any payment (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) in respect of any of the Advances by an amount that Agent or such Lender deems to be material, then, in any case Borrowers shall promptly pay Agent or such Lender, upon its demand, such additional amount as will compensate Agent or such Lender for such additional cost or such reduction, as the case may be, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to increased costs which are reflected in the Eurodollar Rate. Agent or such Lender shall certify the amount of such additional cost or reduced amount to Borrowers, and such certification shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 3.8. Basis For Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair. In the -------------------------------------------------------- event that Agent or any Lender shall have determined that: (a) reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate applicable pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof for any Interest Period; or (b) Dollar deposits in the relevant amount and for the relevant maturity are not available in the London interbank Eurodollar market, with respect to an outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loan, a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan, or a proposed conversion of a Domestic Rate Loan into a Eurodollar Rate Loan, then Agent shall give Borrowing Agent prompt written, telephonic or telegraphic notice of such determination. If such notice is given, (i) any such requested Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be made as a Domestic Rate Loan, unless Borrowing Agent shall notify Agent no later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) two (2) Business Days prior to the date of such proposed borrowing, that its request for such borrowing shall be cancelled or made as an unaffected type of Eurodollar Rate Loan, (ii) any Domestic Rate Loan or Eurodollar Rate Loan which was to have been converted to an affected type of Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be continued as or converted into a Domestic Rate Loan, or, if Borrowing Agent shall notify Agent, no later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) two (2) Business Days prior to the proposed conversion, shall be maintained as an unaffected type of Eurodollar Rate Loan, and (iii) any outstanding affected Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be converted into a Domestic Rate Loan, or, if Borrowing Agent shall notify Agent, no later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) two (2) Business Days prior to the last Business Day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such affected Eurodollar Rate Loan, shall be converted into an unaffected type of Eurodollar Rate Loan, on the last Business Day of the then current Interest Period for such affected Eurodollar Rate Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn, Lenders shall have no obligation to make an affected type of Eurodollar Rate Loan or maintain outstanding affected Eurodollar Rate Loans and no Borrower shall have the right to convert a Domestic Rate Loan or an unaffected type of Eurodollar Rate Loan into an affected type of Eurodollar Rate Loan. 3.9. Capital Adequacy. ---------------- 36
(a) In the event that Agent or any Lender shall have determined that any applicable law, rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by Agent or any Lender (for purposes of this Section 3.9, the term "Lender" shall include Agent or any Lender and any corporation or bank controlling Agent or any Lender) and the office or branch where Agent or any Lender (as so defined) makes or maintains any Eurodollar Rate Loans with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on Agent or any Lender's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which Agent or such Lender could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration Agent's and each Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by Agent or any Lender to be material, then, from time to time, Borrowers shall pay upon demand to Agent or such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate Agent or such Lender for such reduction. In determining such amount or amounts, Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging or attribution methods. The protection of this Section 3.9 shall be available to Agent and each Lender regardless of any possible contention of invalidity or inapplicability with respect to the applicable law, regulation or condition. (b) A certificate of Agent or such Lender setting forth such amount or amounts as shall be necessary to compensate Agent or such Lender with respect to Section 3.9(a) hereof when delivered to Borrowers shall be conclusive absent manifest error. IV. COLLATERAL: GENERAL TERMS -------------------------- 4.1. Security Interest in the Collateral. To secure the prompt payment ----------------------------------- and performance to Agent and each Lender of the Obligations, each Borrower hereby assigns, pledges and grants to Agent for its benefit and for the ratable benefit of each Lender a continuing security interest in and to all of its Collateral, whether now owned or existing or hereafter acquired or arising and wheresoever located. Each Borrower shall mark its books and records as may be necessary or appropriate to evidence, protect and perfect Agent's security interest and shall cause its financial statements to reflect such security interest. Each Borrower shall promptly provide Agent with written notice of all commercial tort claims, such notice to contain the case title together with the applicable court and a brief description of the claim(s). Upon delivery of each such notice, such Borrower shall be deemed to hereby grant to Agent a security interest and lien in and to such commercial tort claims and all proceeds thereof. 4.2. Perfection of Security Interest. Each Borrower shall take all ------------------------------- action that may be necessary or desirable, or that Agent may request, so as at all times to maintain the validity, perfection, enforceability and priority of Agent's security interest in the Collateral or to enable Agent to protect, exercise or enforce its rights hereunder and in the Collateral, including, but not limited to, (i) immediately discharging all Liens other than Permitted Encumbrances, (ii) obtaining landlords' or mortgagees' lien waivers for any location where the book value of 37
Inventory located at such location is greater than $100,000 in the aggregate (provided, however, that if Borrowers are unable to obtain any such waiver, -------- ------- Agent may take a six month rent reserve in the calculation of the Formula Amount for each such location and Borrowers' failure to obtain such waiver shall not constitute an Event of Default), (iii) delivering to Agent, endorsed or accompanied by such instruments of assignment as Agent may specify, and stamping or marking, in such manner as Agent may specify, any and all chattel paper, instruments, letters of credits and advices thereof and documents evidencing or forming a part of the Collateral, (iv) entering into warehousing, lockbox and other custodial arrangements satisfactory to Agent, and (v) executing and delivering financing statements, control agreements, instruments of pledge, mortgages, notices and assignments, in each case in form and substance satisfactory to Agent, relating to the creation, validity, perfection, maintenance or continuation of Agent's security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law. Agent is hereby authorized to file financing statements signed by Agent instead of Borrower in accordance with the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in the State of New York from time to time. By its signature hereto, each Borrower hereby authorizes Agent to file against such Borrower, one or more financing, continuation, or amendment statements pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code in form and substance satisfactory to Agent (which statements may have a description of collateral which is broader than that set forth herein). All charges, expenses and fees Agent may incur in doing any of the foregoing, and any local taxes relating thereto, shall be charged to Borrowers' Account as a Revolving Advance of a Domestic Rate Loan and added to the Obligations, or, at Agent's option, shall be paid to Agent for the ratable benefit of Lenders immediately upon demand. 4.3. Disposition of Collateral.

Financial Disclosure. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes -------------------- and directs all accountants and auditors employed by such Borrower at any time during the Term to exhibit and deliver to Agent and each Lender copies of any of any Borrower's financial statements, trial balances or other accounting records of any sort in the accountant's or auditor's possession, and authorizes such accountants to provide to Agent and each Lender any information such accountants may have concerning such Borrower's financial status and business operations. Each Borrower hereby authorizes all federal, state and municipal authorities to furnish to Agent and each Lender copies of reports or examinations relating to such Borrower, whether made by such Borrower or otherwise; however, Agent and each Lender will attempt to obtain such information or materials directly from such Borrower prior to obtaining such information or materials from such accountants or such authorities. 4.9. Compliance with Laws. Each Borrower shall comply with all acts, -------------------- rules, regulations and orders of any legislative, administrative or judicial body or official applicable to its respective Collateral or any part thereof or to the operation of such Borrower's business the non-compliance with which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The assets of Borrowers at all times shall be maintained in accordance with the requirements of all insurance carriers which provide insurance with respect to the assets of Borrowers so that such insurance shall remain in full force and effect. 4.10. Inspection of Premises. At all reasonable times Agent and each ---------------------- Lender shall have full access to and the right to audit, check, inspect and make abstracts and copies from each Borrower's books, records, audits, correspondence and all other papers relating to the Collateral and the operation of each Borrower's business.

Insurance. Each Borrower shall bear the full risk of any loss of --------- any nature whatsoever with respect to the Collateral. At each Borrower's own cost and expense in amounts customary for companies engaged in businesses similar to the Borrowers and with carriers reasonably acceptable to Agent, each Borrower shall (a) keep all its insurable properties and properties in which each Borrower has an interest insured against the hazards of fire, flood, sprinkler leakage, those hazards covered by extended coverage insurance and such other hazards, and for such amounts, as is customary in the case of companies engaged in businesses similar to such Borrower's including, without limitation, business interruption insurance; (b) maintain a 40
bond in such amounts as is customary in the case of companies engaged in businesses similar to such Borrower insuring against larceny, embezzlement or other criminal misappropriation of insured's officers and employees who may either singly or jointly with others at any time have access to the assets or funds of such Borrower either directly or through authority to draw upon such funds or to direct generally the disposition of such assets; (c) maintain public and product liability insurance against claims for personal injury, death or property damage suffered by others; (d) maintain all such worker's compensation or similar insurance as may be required under the laws of any state or jurisdiction in which such Borrower is engaged in business; (e) furnish Agent with (i) copies of all policies and evidence of the maintenance of such policies by the renewal thereof at least thirty (30) days before any expiration date, and (ii) appropriate loss payable endorsements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Agent, naming Agent as a co-insured and loss payee with respect to the Collateral as its interests may appear with respect to all insurance coverage referred to in clauses (a) and (c) above, and providing (A) that all proceeds thereunder shall be payable to Agent (and jointly with Agent in the case of Arch Air and Mercy so long as such proceeds are delivered directly to Agent), (B) no such insurance shall be affected by any act or neglect of the insured or owner of the property described in such policy, and (C) that such policy and loss payable clauses may not be cancelled, amended or terminated unless at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice is given to Agent. In the event of any loss thereunder, the carriers named therein hereby are directed by Agent and the applicable Borrower to make payment for such loss to Agent and not to such Borrower and Agent jointly. If any insurance losses are paid by check, draft or other instrument payable to any Borrower and Agent jointly, Agent may endorse such Borrower's name thereon and do such other things as Agent may deem advisable to reduce the same to cash. Agent is hereby authorized to adjust and compromise claims under insurance coverage referred to in clauses (a) and (b) above. All loss recoveries received by Agent upon any such insurance may be applied to the Obligations in such order as Agent in its sole discretion shall determine; provided, however, as long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred, Agent shall permit Borrowers to use proceeds of insurance losses up to One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000.00) in the aggregate during any fiscal year of Borrowers to repair or replace the damaged Collateral. Any surplus shall be paid by Agent to Borrowers or applied as may be otherwise required by law. 4.12. Failure to Pay Insurance. If any Borrower fails to obtain insurance ------------------------ as hereinabove provided, or to keep the same in force, Agent, if Agent so elects, may obtain such insurance and pay the premium therefor on behalf of such Borrower, and charge Borrowers' Account therefor as a Revolving Advance of a Domestic Rate Loan and such expenses so paid shall be part of the Obligations. 4.13.

Each Borrower will pay, when due, all taxes, ---------------- assessments and other Charges lawfully levied or assessed upon such Borrower or any of the Collateral including, without limitation, real and personal property taxes, assessments and charges and all franchise, income, employment, social security benefits, withholding, and sales taxes. If any tax by any governmental authority is or may be imposed on or as a result of any transaction between any Borrower and Agent or any Lender which Agent or any Lender may be required to withhold or pay or if any taxes, 41
assessments, or other Charges remain unpaid after the date fixed for their payment, or if any claim shall be made which, in Agent's or any Lender's opinion, may possibly create a valid Lien on the Collateral, Agent may without notice to Borrowers pay the taxes, assessments or other Charges and each Borrower hereby indemnifies and holds Agent and each Lender harmless in respect thereof. The amount of any payment by Agent under this Section 4.13 shall be charged to Borrowers' Account as a Revolving Advance of a Domestic Rate Loan and added to the Obligations and, until Borrowers shall furnish Agent with an indemnity therefor (or supply Agent with evidence satisfactory to Agent that due provision for the payment thereof has been made), Agent may hold without interest any balance standing to Borrowers' credit and Agent shall retain its security interest in any and all Collateral held by Agent. 4.14. Payment of Leasehold Obligations. Each Borrower shall at all times -------------------------------- pay, when and as due (subject to any applicable grace period), its rental obligations under all leases under which it is a tenant, and shall otherwise comply, in all material respects, with all other terms of such leases and keep them in full force and effect and, at Agent's request will provide evidence of having done so. 4.15. Receivables. ----------- (a) Nature of Receivables. Each of the Receivables shall be a --------------------- bona fide and valid account representing a bona fide indebtedness incurred by the Customer therein named, for a fixed sum as set forth in the invoice relating thereto (provided immaterial or unintentional invoice errors shall not be deemed to be a breach hereof) with respect to an absolute sale or lease and delivery of goods upon stated terms of a Borrower, or work, labor or services theretofore rendered by a Borrower as of the date each Receivable is created. Same shall be due and owing in accordance with the applicable Borrower's standard terms of sale without dispute, setoff or counterclaim except as may be reserved against on Borrowers' financial statements or stated on the accounts receivable schedules delivered by Borrowers to Agent. (b) Solvency of Customers. Each Customer, to the best of each --------------------- Borrower's knowledge, as of the date each Receivable is created, is and will be solvent and able to pay all Receivables on which the Customer is obligated in full when due or, with respect to such Customers of any Borrower who are not solvent, such Borrower has set up on its books and in its financial records bad debt reserves adequate to cover such Receivables to the extent determined not to be collectible. (c) Locations of Borrower. Each Borrower's chief executive office --------------------- is located at the addresses set forth on Schedule 4.15(c) hereto. Until written ---------------- notice is given to Agent by Borrowing Agent of any other office at which any Borrower keeps its records pertaining to Receivables, all such records shall be kept at such executive office. (d) Collection of Receivables. Until any Borrower's authority to ------------------------- do so is terminated by Agent (which notice Agent may give at any time following the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default or a Default or when Agent in its sole discretion deems it to be in Lenders' best interest to do so), each Borrower will, at such Borrower's sole cost and expense, but on Agent's behalf and for Agent's account, collect as Agent's property and in trust for Agent all amounts received on Receivables, and shall not commingle such collections with any Borrower's funds or use the same except to pay Obligations. Each Borrower shall, upon request, deliver to Agent, or deposit in the Blocked Account, in original form and on the 42
date of receipt thereof, all checks, drafts, notes, money orders, acceptances, cash and other evidences of Indebtedness. (e) Notification of Assignment of Receivables. At any time ----------------------------------------- following the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default or a Default, Agent shall have the right to send notice of the assignment of, and Agent's security interest in, the Receivables to any and all Customers or any third party holding or otherwise concerned with any of the Collateral. Thereafter, so long as the Event of Default or Default is continuing, Agent shall have the sole right to collect the Receivables, take possession of the Collateral, or both. Agent's actual collection expenses, including, but not limited to, stationery and postage, telephone and telegraph, secretarial and clerical expenses and the salaries of any collection personnel used for collection, may be charged to Borrowers' Account and added to the Obligations. (f) Power of Agent to Act on Borrowers' Behalf. Agent shall have ------------------------------------------ the right to receive, endorse, assign and/or deliver in the name of Agent or any Borrower any and all checks, drafts and other instruments for the payment of money relating to the Receivables, and each Borrower hereby waives notice of presentment, protest and non-payment of any instrument so endorsed. Each Borrower hereby constitutes Agent or Agent's designee as such Borrower's attorney with power (i) to endorse such Borrower's name upon any notes, acceptances, checks, drafts, money orders or other evidences of payment or Collateral; (ii) to sign such Borrower's name on any invoice or bill of lading relating to any of the Receivables, drafts against Customers, assignments and verifications of Receivables; (iii) to send verifications of Receivables to any Customer; (iv) to sign such Borrower's name on all financing statements or any other documents or instruments deemed necessary or appropriate by Agent to preserve, protect, or perfect Agent's interest in the Collateral and to file same; (v) to demand payment of the Receivables; (vi) to enforce payment of the Receivables by legal proceedings or otherwise; (vii) to exercise all of Borrowers' rights and remedies with respect to the collection of the Receivables and any other Collateral; (viii) to settle, adjust, compromise, extend or renew the Receivables; (ix) to settle, adjust or compromise any legal proceedings brought to collect Receivables; (x) to prepare, file and sign such Borrower's name on a proof of claim in bankruptcy or similar document against any Customer; (xi) to prepare, file and sign such Borrower's name on any notice of Lien, assignment or satisfaction of Lien or similar document in connection with the Receivables; and (xii) to do all other acts and things necessary to carry out this Agreement. All acts of said attorney or designee are hereby ratified and approved, and said attorney or designee shall not be liable for any acts of omission or commission nor for any error of judgment or mistake of fact or of law, unless done maliciously or with gross (not mere) negligence; this power being coupled with an interest is irrevocable while any of the Obligations remain unpaid. Agent shall have the right at any time to change the address for delivery of mail addressed to any Borrower to such address as Agent may designate and to receive, open and dispose of all mail addressed to any Borrower. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.15(f) to the contrary, provided that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and neither Agent nor any Lender has a good faith belief that such action must be taken immediately, Agent shall give Borrowers five (5) days notice (together with copies of all relevant documents) prior to taking any of the actions referred to in items (v), (vi), (viii) or (ix) above. (g) No Liability. Neither Agent nor any Lender shall, under any ------------ 43
circumstances or in any event whatsoever, have any liability for any error or omission or delay of any kind occurring in the settlement, collection or payment of any of the Receivables or any instrument received in payment thereof, or for any damage resulting therefrom. Following the occurrence of an Event of Default or Default, Agent may, without notice or consent from any Borrower, sue upon or otherwise collect, extend the time of payment of, compromise or settle for cash, credit or upon any terms any of the Receivables or any other securities, instruments or insurance applicable thereto and/or release any obligor thereof. Agent is authorized and empowered to accept following the occurrence of an Event of Default or Default the return of the goods represented by any of the Receivables, without notice to or consent by any Borrower, all without discharging or in any way affecting any Borrower's liability hereunder. At such times as no Events of Default or Defaults are continuing, Agent will not exercise any of the actions set forth in the preceding two sentences other than those actions already commenced during the continuance of any Events of Default or Default. (h) Establishment of a Lockbox Account, Dominion Account. All ---------------------------------------------------- proceeds of Collateral shall, at the direction of Agent, be deposited by Borrowers into a lockbox account, dominion account or such other "blocked account" ("Blocked Accounts") as Agent may require pursuant to an arrangement with such bank as may be selected by Borrowers and be acceptable to Agent. Borrowers shall issue to any such bank an irrevocable letter of instruction directing said bank to transfer such funds so deposited to Agent, either to any account maintained by Agent at said bank or by wire transfer to appropriate account(s) of Agent. All funds deposited in such Blocked Account shall immediately become the property of Agent and Borrowers shall obtain the agreement by such bank to waive any offset rights against the funds so deposited. Neither Agent nor any Lender assumes any responsibility for such blocked account arrangement, including without limitation, any claim of accord and satisfaction or release with respect to deposits accepted by any bank thereunder. Alternatively, Agent may establish depository accounts ("Depository Accounts") in the name of Agent at a bank or banks for the deposit of such funds and Borrowers shall deposit all proceeds of Collateral or cause same to be deposited, in kind, in such Depository Accounts of Agent in lieu of depositing same to the Blocked Accounts. (i) Adjustments. No Borrower will, without Agent's consent, ----------- compromise or adjust any material amount of the Receivables (or extend the time for payment thereof) or accept any material returns of merchandise or grant any additional discounts, allowances or credits thereon except for those compromises, adjustments, returns, discounts, credits and allowances as have been heretofore customary in the business of such Borrower. 4.16.

Maintenance of Equipment. The Equipment shall be maintained in good ------------------------ operating condition and repair (reasonable wear and tear excepted) and all necessary replacements of and repairs thereto shall be made so that the value and operating efficiency of the Equipment shall be maintained and preserved. No Borrower shall use or operate the Equipment in violation of any law, statute, ordinance, code, rule or regulation. 44
4.18. Exculpation of Liability. Nothing herein contained shall be ------------------------ construed to constitute Agent or any Lender as any Borrower's agent for any purpose whatsoever, nor shall Agent or any Lender be responsible or liable for any shortage, discrepancy, damage, loss or destruction of any part of the Collateral wherever the same may be located and regardless of the cause thereof. Neither Agent nor any Lender, whether by anything herein or in any assignment or otherwise, assume any of any Borrower's obligations under any contract or agreement assigned to Agent or such Lender, and neither Agent nor any Lender shall be responsible in any way for the performance by any Borrower of any of the terms and conditions thereof. 4.19. Environmental Matters. (a) Borrowers shall ensure that the Real --------------------- Property remains in compliance with all Environmental Laws and they shall not place or permit to be placed any Hazardous Substances on any Real Property except as permitted by applicable law or appropriate governmental authorities.

(d) In the event any Borrower obtains, gives or receives notice of any Release or threat of Release of a reportable quantity of any Hazardous Substances at the Real Property (any such event being hereinafter referred to as a "Hazardous Discharge") or receives any notice of violation, request for information or notification that it is potentially responsible for investigation or cleanup of environmental conditions at the Real Property, demand letter or complaint, order, citation, or other written notice with regard to any Hazardous Discharge or violation of Environmental Laws affecting the Real Property or any Borrower's interest therein (any of the foregoing is referred to herein as an "Environmental Complaint") from any Person, including any state agency responsible in whole or in part for environmental matters in the state in which the Real Property is located or the United States Environmental Protection Agency (any such person or entity hereinafter the "Authority"), then Borrowing Agent shall, within five (5) Business Days, give written notice of same to Agent detailing facts and circumstances of which any Borrower is aware giving rise to the Hazardous Discharge or Environmental Complaint. Such information is to be provided to allow Agent to protect its security interest in the Real Property and the Collateral and is not intended to create nor shall it create any obligation upon Agent or any Lender with respect thereto. (e) Borrowers shall promptly forward to Agent copies of any request for 45
information, notification of potential liability, demand letter relating to potential responsibility with respect to the investigation or cleanup of Hazardous Substances at any other site owned, operated or used by any Borrower to dispose of Hazardous Substances and shall continue to forward copies of correspondence between any Borrower and the Authority regarding such claims to Agent until the claim is settled. Borrowers shall promptly forward to Agent copies of all documents and reports concerning a Hazardous Discharge at the Real Property that any Borrower is required to file under any Environmental Laws. Such information is to be provided solely to allow Agent to protect Agent's security interest in the Real Property and the Collateral. (f) Borrowers shall respond promptly to any Hazardous Discharge or Environmental Complaint and take all necessary action in order to safeguard the health of any Person and to avoid subjecting the Collateral or Real Property to any Lien. If any Borrower shall fail to respond promptly to any Hazardous Discharge or Environmental Complaint or any Borrower shall fail to comply with any of the requirements of any Environmental Laws, Agent on behalf of Lenders may, but without the obligation to do so, for the sole purpose of protecting Agent's interest in Collateral: (A) give such notices or (B) enter onto the Real Property (or authorize third parties to enter onto the Real Property) and take such actions as Agent (or such third parties as directed by Agent) deem reasonably necessary or advisable, to clean up, remove, mitigate or otherwise deal with any such Hazardous Discharge or Environmental Complaint. All reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Agent and Lenders (or such third parties) in the exercise of any such rights, including any sums paid in connection with any judicial or administrative investigation or proceedings, fines and penalties, together with interest thereon from the date expended at the Default Rate for Domestic Rate Loans constituting Revolving Advances shall be paid upon demand by Borrowers, and until paid shall be added to and become a part of the Obligations secured by the Liens created by the terms of this Agreement or any other agreement between Agent, any Lender and any Borrower. (g) If required by Agent as determined in Agent's reasonable discretion, promptly upon the written request of Agent from time to time, Borrowers shall provide Agent, at Borrowers' expense, with an environmental site assessment or environmental audit report prepared by an environmental engineering firm acceptable in the reasonable opinion of Agent, to assess with a reasonable degree of certainty the existence of a Hazardous Discharge and the potential costs in connection with abatement, cleanup and removal of any Hazardous Substances found on, under, at or within the Real Property. Any report or investigation of such Hazardous Discharge proposed and acceptable to an appropriate Authority that is charged to oversee the clean-up of such Hazardous Discharge shall be acceptable to Agent. Agent shall have the right to require Borrowers to post a bond, letter of credit or other security reasonably satisfactory to Agent to secure payment of these costs and expenses. (h) Borrowers shall defend and indemnify Agent and Lenders and hold Agent, Lenders and their respective employees, agents, directors and officers harmless from and against all loss, liability, damage and expense, claims, costs, fines and penalties, including attorney's fees, suffered or incurred by Agent or Lenders under or on account of any Environmental Laws, including, without limitation, the assertion of any Lien thereunder, with respect to any Hazardous Discharge, the presence of any Hazardous Substances affecting the Real Property, whether or not the same originates or emerges from the Real Property or any contiguous real estate, including 46
any loss of value of the Real Property as a result of the foregoing except to the extent such loss, liability, damage and expense is attributable to any Hazardous Discharge resulting from actions on the part of Agent or any Lender. Borrowers' obligations under this Section 4.19 shall arise upon the discovery of the presence of any Hazardous Substances at the Real Property, whether or not any federal, state, or local environmental agency has taken or threatened any action in connection with the presence of any Hazardous Substances. Borrowers' obligation and the indemnifications hereunder shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

XI. LENDERS' RIGHTS AND REMEDIES AFTER DEFAULT. ------------------------------------------ 11.1. Rights and Remedies. Upon the occurrence of (i) an Event of Default ------------------- pursuant to Section 10.7 all Obligations shall be immediately due and payable and this Agreement and the obligation of Lenders to make Advances shall be deemed terminated; and, (ii) any of the other Events of Default and at any time thereafter (such default not having previously been cured), at the option of Required Lenders all Obligations shall be immediately due and payable and Lenders shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and to terminate the obligation of Lenders to make Advances and (iii) a filing of a petition against Borrower in any involuntary case under any state or federal bankruptcy laws, the obligation of Lenders to make Advances hereunder shall be terminated other than as may be required by an appropriate order of the bankruptcy court having jurisdiction over any Borrower. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Agent shall have the right to exercise any and all other rights and remedies provided for herein, under the Uniform Commercial Code and at law or equity generally, including, without limitation, the right to foreclose the security interests granted herein and to realize upon any Collateral by any available judicial procedure and/or to take possession of and sell any or all of the Collateral with or without judicial process. Agent may enter any of any Borrower's premises or other premises without legal process and without incurring liability to any Borrower therefor, and Agent may thereupon, or at any time thereafter, in its discretion without notice or demand, take the Collateral and remove the same to such place as Agent may deem advisable and Agent may require Borrowers to make the Collateral available to Agent at a convenient place. With or without having the Collateral at the time or place of sale, Agent may sell the Collateral, or any part thereof, at public or private sale, at any time or place, in one or more sales, at such price or prices, and upon such terms, either for cash, credit or future delivery, as Agent may elect. 71
Except as to that part of the Collateral which is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market, Agent shall give Borrowers reasonable notification of such sale or sales, it being agreed that in all events written notice mailed to Borrowers at least ten (10) days prior to such sale or sales is reasonable notification. At any public sale Agent or any Lender may bid for and become the purchaser, and Agent, any Lender or any other purchaser at any such sale thereafter shall hold the Collateral sold absolutely free from any claim or right of whatsoever kind, including any equity of redemption and such right and equity are hereby expressly waived and released by each Borrower. In connection with the exercise of the foregoing remedies, Agent is granted permission by Borrowers to use all of each Borrower's trademarks, trade styles, trade names, patents, patent applications, licenses, franchises and other proprietary rights which are used in connection with (a) Inventory for the purpose of disposing of such Inventory and (b) Equipment for the purpose of completing the manufacture of unfinished goods. The proceeds realized from the sale of any Collateral shall be applied as follows: first, to the reasonable costs, expenses and attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by Agent for collection and for acquisition, completion, protection, removal, storage, sale and delivery of the Collateral; second, to interest due upon any of the Obligations and any fees payable under this Agreement; and, third, to the principal of the Obligations. If any deficiency shall arise, Borrowers shall remain liable to Agent and Lenders therefor. 11.2. Agent's Discretion. Agent shall have the right in its sole ------------------ discretion to determine which rights, Liens, security interests or remedies Agent may at any time pursue, relinquish, subordinate, or modify or to take any other action with respect thereto and such determination will not in any way modify or affect any of Agent's or Lenders' rights hereunder. 11.3. Setoff. In addition to any other rights which Agent or any Lender ------ may have under applicable law, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder, Agent and such Lender shall have a right to apply any Borrower's property held by Agent and such Lender to reduce the Obligations. 11.4. Rights and Remedies not Exclusive. The enumeration of the foregoing --------------------------------- rights and remedies is not intended to be exhaustive and the exercise of any right or remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other right or remedies provided for herein or otherwise provided by law, all of which shall be cumulative and not alternative. 11.5. Allocation of Payments After Event of Default. Notwithstanding any --------------------------------------------- other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all amounts collected or received by the Agent on account of the Obligations or any other amounts outstanding under any of the Other Documents or in respect of the Collateral may, at Agent's discretion, be paid over or delivered as follows: FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) of the Agent in connection with enforcing the rights of the Lenders under this Agreement and the Other Documents and any protective advances made by the Agent with respect to the Collateral under or pursuant to the terms of this Document; 72
SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Agent; THIRD, to the payment of all of the Obligations consisting of accrued fees and interest; FOURTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of the Obligations (including the payment or cash collateralization of the outstanding Letters of Credit); FIFTH, to all other Obligations and other obligations which shall have become due and payable under the Other Documents or otherwise and not repaid pursuant to clauses "FIRST" through "FOURTH" above; SIXTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whoever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus. In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be applied in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next succeeding category; (ii) each of the Lenders shall receive (so long as it is not a Defaulting Lender) an amount equal to its pro rata share (based on the proportion that the then outstanding Advances held by such Lender bears to the aggregate then outstanding Advances) of amounts available to be applied pursuant to clauses "THIRD", "FOURTH" and "FIFTH" above; and (iii) to the extent that any amounts available for distribution pursuant to clause "FIFTH" above are attributable to the issued but undrawn amount of outstanding Letters of Credit, such amounts shall be held by the Agent in a cash collateral account and applied (A) first, to reimburse the Issuer from time to time for any drawings under such Letters of Credit and (B) then, following the expiration of all Letters of Credit, to all other obligations of the types described in clauses "FOURTH" and "FIFTH" above in the manner provided in this Section 11.5. XII. WAIVERS AND JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS. -------------------------------- 12.1. Waiver of Notice.

The termination of the Agreement shall not affect any ----------- Borrower's, Agent's or any Lender's rights, or any of the Obligations having their inception prior to the effective date of such termination, and the provisions hereof shall continue to be fully operative until all transactions entered into, rights or interests created or Obligations have been fully disposed of, concluded or liquidated. The security interests, Liens and rights granted to Agent and Lenders hereunder and the financing statements filed hereunder shall continue in full force and effect, notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement or the fact that Borrowers' Account may from time to time be temporarily in a zero or credit position, until all of the Obligations of each Borrower have been paid or performed in full after the termination of this Agreement or each Borrower has furnished Agent and Lenders with an indemnification satisfactory to Agent and Lenders with respect thereto. Accordingly, each Borrower waives any rights which it may have under the Uniform Commercial Code to demand the filing of termination statements with respect to the Collateral, and Agent shall not be required to send such termination statements to each Borrower, or to file them with any filing office, unless and until this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms and all Obligations 74
paid in full in immediately available funds. All representations, warranties, covenants, waivers and agreements contained herein shall survive termination hereof until all Obligations are paid or performed in full. XIV. REGARDING AGENT. --------------- 14.1. Appointment. Each Lender hereby designates PNC to act as Agent for ----------- such Lender under this Agreement and the Other Documents. Each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the Other Documents and to exercise such powers and to perform such duties hereunder and thereunder as are specifically delegated to or required of Agent by the terms hereof and thereof and such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto and Agent shall hold all Collateral, payments of principal and interest, fees (except the fees set forth in the Fee Letter), charges and collections (without giving effect to any collection days) received pursuant to this Agreement, for the ratable benefit of Lenders. Agent may perform any of its duties hereunder by or through its agents or employees. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement (including without limitation, collection of the Note) Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Required Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding; provided, however, that Agent shall not be -------- ------- required to take any action which exposes Agent to liability or which is contrary to this Agreement or the Other Documents or applicable law unless Agent is furnished with an indemnification reasonably satisfactory to Agent with respect thereto. 14.2. Nature of Duties. Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities ---------------- except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the Other Documents. Neither Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees or agents shall be (i) liable for any action taken or omitted by them as such hereunder or in connection herewith, unless caused by their gross (not mere) negligence or willful misconduct, or (ii) responsible in any manner for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Borrower or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement, or in any of the Other Documents or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any of the Other Documents or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, due execution, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement, or any of the Other Documents or for any failure of any Borrower to perform its obligations hereunder. Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any of the Other Documents, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Borrower. The duties of Agent as respects the Advances to Borrowers shall be mechanical and administrative in nature; Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender; and nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement except as expressly set forth herein. 14.3.

upon Agent or any other Lender, each Lender has made and shall continue to make (i) its own independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of each Borrower in connection with the making and the continuance of the Advances hereunder and the taking or not taking of any action in connection herewith, and (ii) its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of each Borrower. Agent shall have no duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before making of the Advances or at any time or times thereafter except as shall be provided by any Borrower pursuant to the terms hereof. Agent shall not be responsible to any Lender for any recitals, statements, information, representations or warranties herein or in any agreement, document, certificate or a statement delivered in connection with or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, collectibility or sufficiency of this Agreement or any Other Document, or of the financial condition of any Borrower, or be required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement, the Note, the Other Documents or the financial condition of any Borrower, or the existence of any Event of Default or any Default. Agent may resign on sixty (60) days' written notice to each of Lenders and Borrowing Agent and upon such resignation, the Required Lenders will promptly designate a successor Agent reasonably satisfactory to Borrowers. Any such successor Agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of Agent, and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon its appointment, and the former Agent's rights, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Agent. After any Agent's resignation as Agent, the provisions of this Article XIV shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement. 14.4. Certain Rights of Agent. If Agent shall request instructions from ----------------------- Lenders with respect to any act or action (including failure to act) in connection with this Agreement or any Other Document, Agent shall be entitled to refrain from such act or taking such action unless and until Agent shall have received instructions from the Required Lenders; and Agent shall not incur liability to any Person by reason of so refraining. Without limiting the foregoing, Lenders shall not have any right of action whatsoever against Agent as a result of its acting or refraining from acting hereunder in accordance with the instructions of the Required Lenders. 14.5. Reliance. Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully -------- protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution, notice, statement, certificate, telex, teletype or telecopier message, cablegram, order or other document or telephone message believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper person or entity, and, with respect to all legal matters pertaining to this Agreement and the Other Documents and its duties hereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by it. Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be liable for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by Agent with reasonable care. 14.6. Notice of Default. Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or ----------------- notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder or under the Other Documents, unless 76
Agent has received notice from a Lender or a Borrower referring to this Agreement or the Other Documents, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that Agent receives such a notice, Agent shall give notice thereof to Lenders. Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders; provided, that, unless and until -------- ---- Agent shall have received such directions, Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of Lenders. 14.7. Indemnification. To the extent Agent is not reimbursed and --------------- indemnified by Borrowers, each Lender will reimburse and indemnify Agent in proportion to its respective portion of the Advances (or, if no Advances are outstanding, according to its Commitment Percentage), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against Agent in performing its duties hereunder, or in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any Other Document; provided that, Lenders shall not be liable for any portion -------- ---- of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from Agent's gross (not mere) negligence or willful misconduct. 14.8. Agent in its Individual Capacity. With respect to the obligation of -------------------------------- Agent to lend under this Agreement, the Advances made by it shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Lender and as if it were not performing the duties as Agent specified herein; and the term "Lender" or any similar term shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender. Agent may engage in business with any Borrower as if it were not performing the duties specified herein, and may accept fees and other consideration from any Borrower for services in connection with this Agreement or otherwise without having to account for the same to Lenders. 14.9. Delivery of Documents. To the extent Agent receives financial --------------------- statements required under Sections 9.2(d) (only with respect to monthly Borrowing Base Certificates), 9.7, 9.8, 9.9, 9.12 and 9.13 from Borrowers pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Agent will promptly furnish such documents and information to Lenders. 14.10. Borrowers' Undertaking to Agent. Without prejudice to their ------------------------------- respective obligations to Lenders under the other provisions of this Agreement, each Borrower hereby undertakes with Agent to pay to Agent from time to time on demand all amounts from time to time due and payable by it for the account of Agent or Lenders or any of them pursuant to this Agreement to the extent not already paid. Any payment made pursuant to any such demand shall pro tanto --- ----- satisfy the relevant Borrower's obligations to make payments for the account of Lenders or the relevant one or more of them pursuant to this Agreement. XV. BORROWING AGENCY. ---------------- 15.1. Borrowing Agency Provisions. --------------------------- 77

(c) All Obligations shall be joint and several, and each Borrower shall make payment upon the maturity of the Obligations by acceleration or otherwise, and such obligation and liability on the part of each Borrower shall in no way be affected by any extensions, renewals and forbearance granted to Agent or any Lender to any Borrower, failure of Agent or any Lender to give any Borrower notice of borrowing or any other notice, any failure of Agent or any Lender to pursue or preserve its rights against any Borrower, the release by Agent or any Lender of any Collateral now or thereafter acquired from any Borrower, and such agreement by each Borrower to pay upon any notice issued pursuant thereto is unconditional and unaffected by prior recourse by Agent or any Lender to the other Borrowers or any Collateral for such Borrower's Obligations or the lack thereof.

(vii) increase the Advance Rates above the Advance Rates in effect on the Closing Date. Any such supplemental agreement shall apply equally to each Lender and shall be binding upon Borrowers, Lenders and Agent and all future holders of the Obligations. In the case of any waiver, Borrowers, Agent and Lenders shall be restored to their former positions and rights, and any Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing, but no waiver of a specific Event of Default shall extend to any subsequent Event of Default (whether or not the subsequent Event of Default is the same as the Event of Default which was waived), or impair any right consequent thereon. In the event that Agent requests the consent of a Lender pursuant to this Section 16.2 and such Lender shall not respond or reply to Agent in writing within ten (10) days of delivery of such request, such Lender shall be deemed to have consented to the matter that was the subject of the request. In the event that Agent requests the consent of a Lender pursuant to this Section 16.2 and such consent is denied, then PNC may, at its option, require such Lender to assign its interest in the Advances to PNC or to another Lender or to any other Person designated by the Agent (the "Designated Lender"), for a price equal to the then outstanding principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and fees due such Lender, which interest and fees shall be paid when collected from Borrowers. In the event PNC elects to require any Lender to assign its interest to PNC or to the Designated Lender, PNC will so notify such Lender in writing within forty five (45) days following such Lender's denial, and such Lender will assign its interest to PNC or the Designated Lender no later than five (5) days following receipt of such notice pursuant to a Commitment Transfer Supplement executed by such Lender, PNC or the Designated Lender, as appropriate, and Agent. Notwithstanding (a) the existence of a Default or an Event of Default, (b) that any of the other applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 8.2 hereof have not been satisfied or (c) any other provision of this Loan Agreement, Agent may at its discretion and without the consent of the Required Lenders, voluntarily permit the outstanding Revolving Advances at any time to 80
exceed the Formula Amount by up to one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the Formula Amount for up to thirty (30) consecutive Business Days. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the discretion granted to Agent hereunder shall not preclude involuntary overadvances that may result from time to time due to the fact that the Formula Amount was unintentionally exceeded for any reason, including, but not limited to, Collateral previously deemed to be either "Eligible Receivables", "Eligible Third Party Receivables" or "Eligible Inventory", as applicable, becomes ineligible, collections of Receivables applied to reduce outstanding Revolving Advances are thereafter returned for insufficient funds or overadvances are made to protect or preserve the Collateral. In the event Agent involuntarily permits the outstanding Revolving Advances to exceed the Formula Amount by more than ten percent (10%), Agent shall use its efforts to have Borrowers decrease such excess in as expeditious a manner as is practicable under the circumstances and not inconsistent with the reason for such excess. Revolving Advances made after Agent has determined the existence of involuntary overadvances shall be deemed to be involuntary overadvances and shall be decreased in accordance with the preceding sentence. In addition to (and not in substitution of) the discretionary Revolving Advances permitted above in this Section 16.2, the Agent is hereby authorized by the Borrowers and the Lenders, from time to time in the Agent's sole discretion, (A) after the occurrence and during the continuation of a Default or an Event of Default, or (b) at any time that any of the other applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 8.2 hereof have not been satisfied, to make Revolving Advances to the Borrowers on behalf of the Lenders which the Agent, in its reasonable business judgment, deems necessary or desirable (a) to preserve or protect the Collateral, or any portion thereof, (b) to enhance the likelihood of, or maximize the amount of, repayment of the Advances and other Obligations, or (iii) to pay any other amount chargeable to the Borrowers pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; provided, that at any time after giving effect to any -------- ---- such Revolving Advances the outstanding Revolving Advances do not exceed one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the Formula Amount. 16.3. Successors and Assigns; Participations; New Lenders. --------------------------------------------------- (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Borrowers, Agent, each Lender, all future holders of the Obligations and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Borrower may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Agent and each Lender. (b) Each Borrower acknowledges that in the regular course of commercial banking business one or more Lenders may at any time and from time to time sell participating interests in the Advances to other financial institutions (each such transferee or purchaser of a participating interest, a "Transferee"). Each Transferee may exercise all rights of payment (including without limitation rights of set-off) with respect to the portion of such Advances held by it or other Obligations payable hereunder as fully as if such Transferee were the direct holder thereof provided that Borrowers shall not be required to pay to any Transferee more than the amount which it would have been required to pay to Lender which granted an interest in its Advances or other Obligations payable hereunder to such Transferee had such Lender retained such interest in the Advances hereunder or other Obligations payable hereunder and in no event 81
shall Borrowers be required to pay any such amount arising from the same circumstances and with respect to the same Advances or other Obligations payable hereunder to both such Lender and such Transferee. Each Borrower hereby grants to any Transferee a continuing security interest in any deposits, moneys or other property actually or constructively held by such Transferee as security for the Transferee's interest in the Advances. (c) Any Lender may with the consent of Agent which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed sell, assign or transfer all or any part of its rights under this Agreement and the Other Documents to one or more additional banks or financial institutions and one or more additional banks or financial institutions may commit to make Advances hereunder (each a "Purchasing Lender"), in minimum amounts of not less than $5,000,000, pursuant to a Commitment Transfer Supplement, executed by a Purchasing Lender, the transferor Lender, and Agent and delivered to Agent for recording. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the transfer effective date determined pursuant to such Commitment Transfer Supplement, (i) Purchasing Lender thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, have the rights and obligations of a Lender thereunder with a Commitment Percentage as set forth therein, and (ii) the transferor Lender thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, be released from its obligations under this Agreement, the Commitment Transfer Supplement creating a novation for that purpose. Such Commitment Transfer Supplement shall be deemed to amend this Agreement to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of such Purchasing Lender and the resulting adjustment of the Commitment Percentages arising from the purchase by such Purchasing Lender of all or a portion of the rights and obligations of such transferor Lender under this Agreement and the Other Documents. Borrowers hereby consent to the addition of such Purchasing Lender and the resulting adjustment of the Commitment Percentages arising from the purchase by such Purchasing Lender of all or a portion of the rights and obligations of such transferor Lender under this Agreement and the Other Documents. Borrowers shall execute and deliver such further documents and do such further acts and things in order to effectuate the foregoing. (d) Agent shall maintain at its address a copy of each Commitment Transfer Supplement delivered to it and a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Advances owing to each Lender from time to time. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and Borrowers, Agent and Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the Advance recorded therein for the purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by Borrowers or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. Agent shall receive a fee in the amount of $3,500 payable by the applicable Purchasing Lender upon the effective date of each transfer or assignment to such Purchasing Lender. (e) Each Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Transferee or Purchasing Lender and any prospective Transferee or Purchasing Lender any and all financial information in such Lender's possession concerning such Borrower which has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of such Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with such Lender's credit evaluation of such Borrower. 82
16.4. Application of Payments. Agent shall have the continuing and ----------------------- exclusive right to apply or reverse and re-apply any payment and any and all proceeds of Collateral to any portion of the Obligations. To the extent that any Borrower makes a payment or Agent or any Lender receives any payment or proceeds of the Collateral for any Borrower's benefit, which are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, debtor in possession, receiver, custodian or any other party under any bankruptcy law, common law or equitable cause, then, to such extent, the Obligations or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continue as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by Agent or such Lender. 16.5. Indemnity. Each Borrower shall indemnify Agent, each Lender and --------- each of their respective officers, directors, Affiliates, employees and agents from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of counsel) which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against Agent or any Lender in any litigation, proceeding or investigation instituted or conducted by any governmental agency or instrumentality or any other Person with respect to any aspect of, or any transaction contemplated by, or referred to in, or any matter related to, this Agreement or the Other Documents, whether or not Agent or any Lender is a party thereto, except to the extent that any of the foregoing arises out of the willful misconduct of the party being indemnified. 16.6. Notice. Any notice or request hereunder may be given to Borrowing ------ Agent or any Borrower or to Agent or any Lender at their respective addresses set forth below or at such other address as may hereafter be specified in a notice designated as a notice of change of address under this Section.

Injunctive Relief.

Consequential Damages. Neither Agent nor any Lender, nor any agent --------------------- or attorney for any of them, shall be liable to any Borrower for consequential damages arising from any breach of contract, tort or other wrong relating to the establishment, administration or collection of the Obligations. 16.12.

For the purposes of the preceding clause (c), the Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of a Senior Debt Default occurring as a result of a breach of any financial covenant under the Senior Credit Agreement until the earlier of (i) the receipt by the Agent of written notification from management of Air Methods that there has been a breach of such financial covenant and (ii) 5 Business Days after the Agent has received the financial statements necessary to determine compliance with such financial covenant. The provisions of this paragraph 5A(4) shall not prevent any payment on or in respect of the Subordinated Debt which would (in the absence of any such Senior Debt Default) have been payable on any date during a Blockage Period from being paid following the termination of such Blockage Period. For purpose of this paragraph 5A(4), "NOTE AGENT" shall mean PCP for so long as PCP and its Affiliates hold at least 50.1% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes from time to time outstanding, and at all other times such term shall mean the holder of the greatest aggregate principal amount of Notes from time to time outstanding of whom Agent has knowledge. 5A(5).

of the Notes are not permitted to receive payments on the Subordinated Debt pursuant to either paragraph 5A(3) or 5A(4) and continuing until the earliest of (i) the date when all Senior Debt Defaults giving rise to the blockage of payments on the Notes pursuant to paragraph 5A(3) or 5A(4) have been cured or waived in writing, (ii) the date of the repayment in full of the Senior Debt and the termination of the Senior Credit Agreement, (iii) the date that is 135 days after a Senior Debt payment default, (iv) the end of the Blockage Period that caused the initiation of such Standstill Period, (v) the date on which (a) any Senior Debt shall have been declared due and payable prior to its stated maturity or any holder of Senior Debt or the Agent commences proceedings to collect any Senior Debt or (b) any holder of Senior Debt (or its representative) commences the realization (whether through proceedings or self-help) upon any material part of the collateral for any Senior Debt and (vi) the date upon which any Insolvency Proceeding is commenced. Upon the termination of the Standstill Period, the holders of the Notes may exercise all rights or remedies they may have at law or in equity. 5A(6) TURNOVER. If any payment or distribution of any character, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be received by any holder of Notes in contravention of any of the terms of this paragraph 5 and before all the Senior Debt shall have been paid in full, such payment or distribution shall be received in trust for the Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Debt at the time outstanding and shall forthwith be paid over or delivered and transferred to the Agent. 5A(7) FILING CLAIMS. Each holder of Notes shall duly and promptly take such action as is reasonably necessary to file appropriate claims or proofs of claim in any Insolvency Proceeding and to execute and deliver such other instruments and take such other actions as may be reasonably necessary to prove or realize upon such claims and to have the proceeds of such claims paid as provided in this paragraph 5. In the event any holder of Notes shall not have made any such filing on or prior to the date 10 days before the expiration of the time for such filing or shall not have timely executed or delivered any such other instruments and taken such other actions, the Agent is hereby authorized, as the agent and attorney-in-fact for such holder of Notes for the specific and limited purpose set forth in this paragraph, but shall have no obligation, to file such proof of claim for or on behalf of such holder of Notes, execute and deliver such other instruments for or on behalf of such holder of Notes and take 13.
such other action necessary under applicable law to collect (subject to the provisions of paragraph 5A(2)) any amounts due in respect of such claim in such proceeding. Anything contained in this paragraph notwithstanding, the right to vote any claim or claims in respect of the Subordinated Debt in connection with any Insolvency Proceeding is exclusively reserved to the holders of the Notes. 5B. OBLIGATION OF THE CO-OBLIGORS UNCONDITIONAL. The provisions of this paragraph 5 are for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Agent and the holders of Senior Debt, on the one hand, and the holders of the Notes, on the other hand, against the Co-Obligors and their property, and nothing herein shall impair, as between the Co-Obligors and the holders of the Notes, the obligation of the Co-Obligors, which is joint and several, and unconditional and absolute, to pay to the holders thereof the Subordinated Debt in accordance with the terms and the provisions of this Agreement and the Notes. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 5A(5), nothing contained herein shall prevent the holders of the Notes from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law or under this Agreement upon default under this Agreement or under the Notes (including the right to demand payment and sue for performance of the Agreement and of the Notes and to accelerate the maturity of the Notes as provided in paragraph 8A), subject to the rights, if any, under this paragraph 5 of the Agent and the holders of Senior Debt to receive cash, property, stock or obligations otherwise payable or deliverable by the Co-Obligors to the holders of the Notes. 5C.

RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF SENIOR DEBT. The provisions of this paragraph 5 shall be deemed a continuing offer to all holders of Senior Debt to act in reliance on such provisions (but no such reliance shall be required to be proven 14.
to receive the benefits hereof) and may be enforced by such holders, and no right of any present or future holder of any Senior Debt to enforce subordination as provided in this paragraph 5 shall be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of any Co-Obligor or by any act or failure to act by any such holder, or by any non-compliance by any Co-Obligor with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Agreement or the Notes. Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing, the holders of Senior Debt may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the holders of the Notes, and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this paragraph 5 or the obligations hereunder of the holders of the Notes to the holders of Senior Debt, do any one or more of the following: (i) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, or increase (subject to the proviso at the end of the definition of "Senior Debt" contained in paragraph 11B) or decrease, or waive defaults under Senior Debt, or otherwise amend or supplement in any manner Senior Debt or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which Senior Debt is outstanding, provided that no amendment or supplement shall have the effect of increasing the Applicable Margin (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement), exclusive of any increase solely by virtue of any imposition of the Default Rate (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement), by more than 300 basis points per annum in excess of that in effect on the date hereof; (ii) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged or mortgaged to secure or otherwise securing Senior Debt; (iii) release any Person liable in any manner for the payment or collection of Senior Debt; and (iv) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against any Co-Obligor and any other Person, including any guarantor or surety. The provisions of this paragraph 5 shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated as of the date immediately prior to payment in full of the Senior Debt and the termination of the Senior Credit Agreement, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Senior Debt is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the holders of Senior Debt upon occurrence of an event described in paragraph 5A(1), or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made. 5E. RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF SENIOR DEBT. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph 5, in no event shall any Credit Party or any Affiliate or Subsidiary thereof receive the benefit of this paragraph 5 if at any time it shall hold any Senior Debt. 15.
5F. AMENDMENTS. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or otherwise to the contrary, none of the terms of this paragraph 5 or any definitions used herein directly relating to the Senior Debt may be amended without the express written consent of the Agent, and any amendment without such prior written consent shall be null and void and without effect. In addition, without the express prior written consent of the Agent, this Agreement and the Notes will not be amended to: (i) modify (other than by extension) the schedule of principal payments in respect of the Subordinated Debt; (ii) increase the cash coupon of the Subordinated Debt by more than 3.00% per annum; (iii) increase (other than pursuant to a payment-in-kind provision) the principal amount outstanding in respect of the Subordinated Debt; and (iv) modify any reference in this Agreement to any provision or paragraph being subject to this paragraph 5. 6.

The guaranty in this paragraph 13 shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of any Co-Obligor in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder(s) of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise. 13D. SUBROGATION. Until the payment in full of the principal of and interest on the Notes and all other amounts payable to the holders of the Notes hereunder (subject to paragraph 13C above), each Co-Obligor hereby irrevocably 78.
waives all rights of subrogation, whether arising by operation of law (including any such right arising under the Code) or otherwise, by reason of any payment by it pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph 13 or otherwise. 13E. RIGHT OF CONTRIBUTION; SUBORDINATION. The Co-Obligors hereby agree that to the extent that a Co-Obligor shall have paid an amount hereunder or under any other Transaction Document, as applicable, to any of the holders of Notes that is greater than the net value of the benefits received, directly or indirectly, by such paying Co-Obligor as a result of the issuance and sale of the Notes, such paying Co-Obligor shall be entitled to contribution from any Co-Obligor that has not paid its proportionate share, based on benefits received as a result of the issuance and sale of the Notes. Any amount payable as a contribution under this paragraph 13E shall be determined as of the date on which the related payment or distribution is made by the Co-Obligor seeking contribution and the parties hereto acknowledge that the right to contribution hereunder shall constitute an asset of such Co-Obligor to which such contribution is owed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this paragraph 13E shall in no respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Co-Obligor to the Purchasers hereunder or under any other Transaction Document, as applicable, and each Co-Obligor shall remain liable for the full amount evidenced by the Notes. Any Indebtedness or other obligation (including any obligation under this paragraph 13E) of any Co-Obligor now or hereafter held by or owing to any Co-Obligor is hereby subordinated in time and right of payment to all obligations of the Co-Obligors to the holders of Notes. Each Co-Obligor hereby agrees that, concurrent with the initial execution and delivery of the Multiparty Guaranty by a Subsidiary of a Co-Obligor pursuant to the requirements of paragraph 6N, the Co-Obligors will be bound by the terms of Section 1(g) of the Multiparty Guaranty, which Section 1(g) shall thereupon supersede this paragraph 13E with respect to each Credit Party.

The Shelf Registration shall be on Form S-1, with re-filing on Form S-3 at such time as the Company becomes eligible for use of that form (provided that the Form S-1 shall remain effective until the effectiveness of the From S-3), or another appropriate form permitting registration of such Registrable Securities for resale by Holders in the manner or manners designated by them (including, without limitation, one or more underwritten offerings). Except for up to 100,000 shares subject to exercise under warrants issued to RCG Capital Management Group, Inc., the Company shall not permit any securities other than the Registrable Securities to be included in the Shelf Registration. As used herein the term "SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT") means any Registration Statement filed in connection with the Shelf Registration. The Company shall use its best efforts to cause the Shelf Registration to be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable and in any event on or prior to the Effectiveness Date and to keep the Shelf Registration continuously effective under the Securities Act until such time as all Registrable Securities can be sold under Rule 144 under the Securities Act without volume limitations (as it may be shortened pursuant to clause (i) or clause (ii) immediately following, the "EFFECTIVENESS PERIOD"), or such shorter period ending when (i) all the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration have been sold in the manner set forth and as contemplated in the Shelf Registration or (ii) the date on which all the Registrable Securities (x) held by Persons who are not affiliates of the Company may be resold pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act or (y) cease to be outstanding or 4
(iii) the date on which all of the securities described in the first sentence of the definition of "Registrable Securities" shall have ceased to be "Registrable Securities" pursuant to the second sentence of such definition. (b) SUPPLEMENTS AND AMENDMENTS. The Company shall promptly supplement and amend the Shelf Registration if required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used for the Shelf Registration, if required by the Securities Act, or if reasonably requested by the Holders of a majority (by number of shares) of the Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement or by any underwriter of such Registrable Securities. 3. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. (a) The parties hereto agree that the Holders will suffer damages if the Company fails to fulfill its obligations under Section 2 hereof and that it would not be feasible to ascertain the extent of such damages with precision. Accordingly, the Company agrees to pay liquidated damages on the Registrable Securities ("LIQUIDATED DAMAGES") under the circumstances and to the extent set forth below (each of which shall be given independent effect; each a "REGISTRATION DEFAULT"): (i) if the Shelf Registration is not filed on or prior to the Filing Date, then commencing on the day after the Filing Date, Liquidated Damages shall accrue (with the aggregate amount of such Liquidated Damages to be calculated, and such amount to be ratably paid to the Holders, as set forth in the last sentence of Section 3(c)) at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 30 days immediately following the Filing Date, such Liquidated Damages increasing by an additional 0.25% per annum at the beginning of each subsequent 30-day period; (ii) if the Initial Shelf Registration is not declared effective by the SEC on or prior to the Effectiveness Date, then commencing on the day after the Effectiveness Date, Liquidated Damages shall accrue (with the aggregate amount of such Liquidated Damages to be calculated, and such amount to be ratably paid to the Holders, as set forth in the last sentence of Section 3(c)) at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 30 days immediately following the day after such Effectiveness Date, such Liquidated Damages increasing by an additional 0.25% per annum at the beginning of each subsequent 30-day period; and (iii) if the Shelf Registration has been declared effective and ceases to be effective at any time during the Effectiveness Period (other than as permitted under Section 3(b) hereof), Liquidated Damages shall accrue (with the aggregate amount of such Liquidated Damages to be calculated, and such amount to be ratably paid to the Holders, as set forth in the last sentence of Section 3(c)) at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 30 days commencing on the day the Shelf Registration ceases to be effective, 5
such Liquidated Damages increasing by an additional 0.25% per annum at the beginning of each such subsequent 30-day period; provided, however, that at no time shall the aggregate rate of Liquidated Damages accruing exceed in the aggregate 2.00% per annum; provided, further, however, that (1) upon the filing of the Initial Shelf Registration as required hereunder (in the case of clause (a)(i) of this Section 3), (2) upon the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration as required hereunder (in the case of clause (a)(ii) of this Section 3) or (3) upon the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration which had ceased to remain effective, or a subsequent Shelf Registration, as applicable (in the case of clause (a)(iii) of this Section 3), Liquidated Damages on the Registrable Securities as a result of such clause (or the relevant subclause thereof), as the case may be, shall cease to accrue. (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this Section 3, the Company shall be permitted to suspend the effectiveness of the Prospectus for a period not to exceed 30 days in any 90-day period, and not to exceed an aggregate of 60 days in any 360-day period, if (i) the Prospectus contained in the Shelf Registration Statement would, in the Company's good faith judgment, contain a material misstatement or omission as a result of a previously undisclosed proposed or pending material business transaction, the disclosure of which would impede the Company's ability to consummate such transaction. (c) The Company shall notify the Holders within two Business Days after each and every date on which an event occurs in respect of which Liquidated Damages are required to be paid. Any accrued and unpaid amounts of Liquidated Damages pursuant to (a)(i), (a)(ii) or (a)(iii) of this Section 3 will be payable in cash quarterly on each of January 16, April 16, July 16 and October 16 (each a "DAMAGES PAYMENT DATE"), commencing with the first such date occurring after any such Liquidated Damages begin to accrue. The aggregate amount of Liquidated Damages will be determined by multiplying the applicable rate of Liquidated Damages by $23,000,000, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days such Liquidated Damages rate was applicable during such period (determined on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months and, in the case of a partial month, the actual number of days elapsed), and the denominator of which is 360, and such aggregate amount shall be allocated to each Holder ratably based on the Registrable Securities (by number of shares) held by such Holder at the time any such Liquidated Damages begin to accrue divided by the Registrable Securities (by number of shares) held by all Holders at such time. 4. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES. In connection with the filing of the Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2 hereof, the Company shall effect such registration to permit the resale of the securities covered thereby in accordance with the intended method or methods of disposition thereof, and pursuant thereto and in connection with the Registration Statement filed by the Company hereunder the Company shall: 6
(a) Prepare and file with the SEC prior to the Filing Date, a Registration Statement as prescribed by Section 2 hereof, and use its best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become effective and remain effective as provided herein; provided, however, that before filing the Registration Statement or Prospectus (including any amendments or supplements thereto), the Company shall furnish to and afford the Holders that have provided the information required by the second full paragraph of Section 4, their counsel and the managing underwriters, if any, a reasonable opportunity to review copies of all such documents proposed to be filed (in each case, where possible, at least five Business Days prior to such filing, or such date as is reasonable under the circumstances). The Company shall not file any Registration Statement or Prospectus (including any amendments or supplements thereto) if the Holders of a majority (by number of shares) of the Registrable Securities that have provided the information required by the second full paragraph of Section 4, their counsel or the managing underwriters, if any, shall reasonably object. (b) Prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and post-effective amendments to the Shelf Registration as may be necessary to keep the Registration Statement continuously effective for the Effectiveness Period; cause the related Prospectus to be supplemented by any prospectus supplement required by applicable law, and as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 (or any similar provisions then in force) promulgated under the Securities Act; and comply with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act applicable to it with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such Registration Statement as so amended or in such Prospectus as so supplemented. (c) Notify the selling Holders, their counsel and the managing underwriters, if any, promptly (but in any event within two Business Days) and, if requested by such persons, confirm such notice in writing, (i) when a Prospectus (including any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment) has been filed, and, with respect to the Registration Statement (including any post-effective amendment), when the same has become effective under the Securities Act, (ii) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (iii) of the happening of any event, the existence of any condition or any information becoming known that makes any statement made in such Registration Statement or related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect or that requires the making of any changes in or amendments or supplements to such Registration Statement, Prospectus or documents so that, in the case of the Registration Statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and that in the case of the Prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which 7
they were made, not misleading and (iv) of the Company's determination that a post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement would be appropriate. (d) Use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or of any order preventing or suspending the use of a Prospectus and, if any such order is issued, to use its best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any such order at the earliest possible time. (e) In the event of an underwritten offering pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, if requested by the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, or the Holders of a majority (by number of shares) of the Registrable Securities being sold in connection with such underwritten offering (i) promptly incorporate in a prospectus supplement or, if required, a post-effective amendment such information as the managing underwriter or underwriters (if any), such Holders or counsel for any of them reasonably determine is necessary to be included therein, (ii) make all required filings of such prospectus supplement or such post-effective amendment as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company has received notification of the matters to be incorporated in such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment and (iii) supplement or make amendments to such Registration Statement. (f) Furnish to each selling Holder, its counsel and each managing underwriter, if any, at the sole expense of the Company, one conformed copy of the Registration Statement or Registration Statements and each post-effective amendment thereto, including financial statements and schedules, and all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference and all exhibits. (g) Deliver to each selling Holder, its counsel and the underwriters, if any, at the sole expense of the Company, as many copies of the Prospectus (including each form of preliminary prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto and any documents incorporated by reference therein) as such Persons may reasonably request; and the Company hereby consents to the use of the Prospectus (including each amendment or supplement thereto) by each of the selling Holders and the underwriters or agents, if any, and dealers (if any), in connection with the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by the Prospectus (including any amendment or supplement thereto). (h) Prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, to use its best efforts to register or qualify, to the extent required by applicable law, and to cooperate with the selling Holders, the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, and their respective counsel in connection with the registration or qualification (or exemption from such registration or qualification) of such Registrable Securities or offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions within the United States as any selling Holder, or the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, reasonably request; provided, however, that where Registrable Securities are offered other than 8
through an underwritten offering, the Company agrees to cause the Company's counsel to perform Blue Sky investigations and file registrations and qualifications required to be filed pursuant to this Section 4(h); keep each such registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective during the period such Registration Statement is required to be kept effective and do any and all other acts or things reasonably necessary or advisable to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities covered by the applicable Registration Statement; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to (A) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified, (B) take any action that would subject it to general service of process in any such where it is not then so subject or (C) subject itself to taxation in excess of a nominal dollar amount in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject. (i) Cooperate with the selling Holders and the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing shares of Registrable Securities to be sold, which certificates, when such Registrable Securities are sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement, shall not bear any restrictive legends (unless sold to affiliates of the Company); and enable such shares of Registrable Securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, or Holders may reasonably request. (j) Use its best efforts to cause the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement to be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be reasonably necessary to enable the seller or sellers thereof or the underwriter or underwriters, if any, to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities, except as may be required solely as a consequence of the nature of such selling Holder's business, in which case the Company will cooperate in all reasonable respects with the filing of such Registration Statement and the granting of such approvals. (k) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section 4(c)(ii), 4(c)(iii) or 4(c)(iv) hereof, as promptly as practicable (except during any suspension of the effectiveness of the Prospectus pursuant to Section 3(b) hereof, in which case full compliance shall be effected not later than the Business Day immediately following the last day of any such suspension period) prepare and (subject to Section 4(a) hereof) file with the SEC, at the sole expense of the Company, a supplement or post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the Registrable Securities being sold thereunder, the Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein 9
or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. (l) (i) In connection with any underwritten offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration, enter into an underwriting agreement as is customary in underwritten offerings of securities similar to the Registrable Securities and take all such other actions as are reasonably requested by the managing underwriter or underwriters in order to expedite or facilitate the registration or the disposition of such Registrable Securities and, in such connection, make such representations and warranties to, and covenants with, the underwriters with respect to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries (including any acquired business, properties or entity, if applicable) and the Registration Statement, Prospectus (including all documents, if any, incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein), in each case, as are customarily made by issuers to underwriters in underwritten offerings of securities similar to the Registrable Securities and confirm the same in writing if and when requested. The Holders of Registrable Securities to be distributed through such underwriting may, at their option, require that any or all of the representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part of the Company to and for the benefit of such underwriters shall also be made to and for the benefit of such Holders and that any or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters under such underwriting agreement shall also be conditions precedent to the obligations of such Holders. Any such Holder shall not be required to make any representations or warranties to or agreements with the Company or the underwriters other than representations, warranties or agreements regarding such Holder, such Holder's Registrable Securities, such Holder's intended method of distribution, information requested by such Holder in writing to be included in the registration statement, and any other representation required by law. No such Holder shall be required to indemnify the underwriters or any other Person for any breach by the Company of its representations, warranties or agreements. (ii) Furnish, at the request of any Holder, on the date that such Registrable Securities are delivered to the underwriters for sale in connection with a registration, if such Registrable Securities are being sold through underwriters, (A) a signed counterpart of an opinion, dated such date, of counsel representing the Company for the purposes of such registration, in form, scope and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Holder, addressed to the underwriters and to such Holder and (B) a letter, dated such date, signed by the independent certified public accountants of the Company, in form, scope and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Holder, addressed to the underwriters and to such Holder, covering substantially the same matters with respect to the Registration Statement (and the Prospectus included therein) and, in the case of the independent certified public accountants' letter, with respect to events subsequent to the date of the applicable financial statements, as are customarily covered in opinions of issuers' counsel and in independent certified public accountants' letters delivered to the underwriters in underwritten public offerings of securities and, in the 10
case of the independent certified public accountants' letter, such other financial matters, and, in the case of the legal opinion, such other legal matters, as such Holder (or the underwriters) may reasonably request. (iii) If such Registrable Securities are not being sold through underwriters, furnish at the request of any Holder (A) within 25 days after such request, a signed counterpart of an opinion, dated such date, of counsel representing the Company for the purposes of such registration, in form, scope and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Holder, and addressed to such Holder, covering substantially the same matters with respect to the Registration Statement (and the Prospectus included therein) as are customarily covered in opinions of issuers' counsel delivered to the underwriters in underwritten public offerings of securities and such other legal matters as such Holder may reasonably request; provided that the Company shall be required to deliver no more than two such opinions, and (B) on the date that the registration statement with respect to such Registrable Securities becomes effective, a letter signed by the independent certified public accountants of the Company, in form, scope and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Holder, addressed to such Holder, covering substantially the same matters with respect to the Registration Statement (and the Prospectus included therein) and with respect to events subsequent to the date of the applicable financial statements, as are customarily covered in independent certified public accountants' letters delivered to underwriters in underwritten public offerings of securities, and such other financial matters as such Holder may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may satisfy its obligation under clause (B) of the immediately preceding sentence by making representations and warranties in form, scope and substance satisfactory to such Holder. (m) Provide (i) the Holders and their counsel, (ii) the underwriters (which term, for purposes of this Agreement, shall include a Person deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Securities Act), if any, thereof, (iii) the sales or placement agent, if any, thereof and (iv) one counsel for such underwriters or agents, reasonable opportunity to participate in the preparation of such Registration Statement, the Prospectus included therein or filed with the SEC, and each amendment or supplement thereto. (n) Comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and make generally available to its securityholders "earning statements" satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder (or any similar rule promulgated under the Securities Act) no later than 45 days after the end of any 12-month period (or 90 days after the end of any 12-month period if such period is a fiscal year) (i) commencing at the end of any fiscal quarter in which Registrable Securities are sold to underwriters in a firm commitment or best efforts underwritten offering and (ii) if not sold to underwriters in such an offering, commencing on the first day of each first fiscal quarter of the Company after the effective date of the Registration Statement 11
during which Registrable Securities are sold pursuant to the Registration Statement, which statements shall cover said 12-month periods. (o) Cooperate with each seller of Registrable Securities covered by any Registration Statement and each underwriter, if any, participating in the disposition of such Registrable Securities and their respective counsel in connection with any filings required to be made with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD"), including, if the Conduct Rules of the NASD or any successor thereto as amended from time to time so require, engaging a "qualified independent underwriter" ("QIU") as contemplated therein and making Records available to such QIU as though it were a participating underwriter for the purposes of Section 11 and otherwise applying the provisions of this Agreement to such QIU (including indemnification) as though it were a participating underwriter. (p) Cause the Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be listed at all times on each securities exchange or automated quotation system on which similar securities issued by the Company are listed. (q) Use its best efforts to take all other steps necessary or advisable to effect the registration of the Registrable Securities. The Company may condition its obligations hereunder on the receipt from each seller of Registrable Securities as to which registration is being effected of such information regarding such seller and the distribution of such Registrable Securities as shall be required to effect the registration of such seller's Registrable Securities. Each seller as to which the Shelf Registration is being effected agrees to furnish promptly to the Company all information required to be disclosed so that the information previously furnished to the Company by such seller is not materially misleading and does not omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made. Each Holder agrees by acquisition of such Registrable Securities that, upon actual receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 4(c)(ii), 4(c)(iii) or 4(c)(iv) hereof, such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of such Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement or Prospectus until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 4(k) hereof, or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the applicable Prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any amendments or supplements thereto. 5. REGISTRATION EXPENSES. All fees and expenses incident to the performance of or compliance with this Agreement by the Company shall be borne by the Company, including, without limitation, (i) all registration and filing fees (including, without limitation, (A) fees with respect to filings 12
required to be made with the NASD in connection with an underwritten offering and (B) fees and expenses of compliance with state securities or Blue Sky laws (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel in connection with Blue Sky qualifications of the Registrable Securities and determination of the eligibility of the Registrable Securities for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as provided in Section 4(h) hereof)), (ii) printing expenses (including, without limitation, expenses of printing prospectuses if the printing of prospectuses is requested by the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, or by the Holders of a majority (in number of shares) of the Registrable Securities included in any Registration Statement), (iii) messenger, telephone or delivery expenses, (iv) fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company and reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel for the sellers of Registrable Securities (selected by the Holders (by number of shares) of a majority of Registrable Securities being sold), (v) fees and disbursements of all independent certified public accountants referred to in Section 4(l)(ii) hereof (including, without limitation, the expenses of any special audit and "cold comfort" letters required by or incident to such performance), (vi) Securities Act liability insurance covering officers and directors of the Company, if the Company desires such insurance, (vii) fees and expenses of all other Persons retained by the Company, (viii) internal expenses of the Company (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of officers and employees of the Company performing legal or accounting duties), (ix) the expense of any annual audit, (x) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing or quoting of the securities to be registered on any securities exchange or automated quotation system and (xi) the expenses relating to printing, word processing and distributing all Registration Statements, underwriting agreements, securities sales agreements and any other documents necessary in order to comply with this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Holder shall pay all underwriting discounts and brokerage commissions with respect to any Registrable Securities sold by it. 6. INDEMNIFICATION. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless (i) each Holder, (ii) each Person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) any Holder (any of the Persons referred to in this clause (ii) being hereinafter referred to as a "controlling person") and (iii) the respective officers, directors, partners, employees, representatives and agents of the Holders (including predecessor Holders) or any controlling person (any person referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) may hereinafter be referred to as an "INDEMNIFIED HOLDER"), from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or Prospectus (including any amendment or supplement thereto or any related preliminary prospectus), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any 13
untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to any Holder furnished to the Company in writing by such Holder expressly for use in therein; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable to any Indemnified Holder under the indemnity agreement of this paragraph with respect to any preliminary prospectus to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability, judgment or expense of such Indemnified Holder results from the fact that such Indemnified Holder sold Registrable Securities under a Registration Statement to a Person as to whom it shall be established that there was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Prospectus (or of the preliminary prospectus as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished such Indemnified Holder with such amendment or supplement thereto on a timely basis), in any case where such delivery is required by applicable law and the loss, claim, damage, liability or expense of such Indemnified Holder results from an untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in the preliminary prospectus which was corrected in the Prospectus (including the preliminary prospectus as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished such Indemnified Holder with such amendment or supplement thereto, as the case may be, on a timely basis). The Company shall notify each Indemnified Holder promptly of the institution, threat or assertion of any claim, proceeding (including any governmental investigation) or litigation in connection with the matters addressed by this Agreement which involves the Company or such Indemnified Holder. Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, officers and each Person who controls the Company (within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Holder, but only with reference to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities which are caused by any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to a Holder furnished to the Company in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement or Prospectus (including any amendment or supplement thereto or any related preliminary prospectus). If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any Person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such Person (the "INDEMNIFIED PERSON") shall promptly notify the Person or Persons against whom such indemnity may be sought (each an "INDEMNIFYING PERSON") in writing, and such Indemnifying Person, upon request of the Indemnified Person, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 6 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) such Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, (ii) such Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel 14
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person or (iii) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include an Indemnifying Person and an Indemnified Person and the Indemnified Person reasonably concludes that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicting interests between them. It is understood that an Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for the Indemnified Holders shall be designated in writing by the Holders of a majority (by number of shares) of the Registrable Securities, and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, officers and such control Persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, such Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify any Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. If the indemnification provided for in the first and second paragraphs of this Section 6 is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Person on the one hand, and the Indemnified Person on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or such Indemnified Holder and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. Each party hereto agrees that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6 were determined by pro-rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6, in no event shall 15
any Holder be required to contribute or indemnify for any amount in excess of the net proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. If the Company and any Holders enter into an underwriting agreement that contains indemnification provisions inconsistent with this Section 6, the terms of this Section 6 will supersede such terms of the underwriting agreement. The remedies provided for in this Section 6 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity. The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 6 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder or any Person controlling any Holder or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any other Person controlling any of the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Registrable Securities. 7. RULES 144 AND 144A. The Company covenants that it will file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder in a timely manner in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and, for so long as any Registrable Securities remain outstanding, if at any time the Company is not required to file such reports, it will, upon the request of any Holder or beneficial owner of Registrable Securities, make available such information as is necessary to permit sales pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Company further covenants that, for so long as any Registrable Securities remain outstanding, it will use its best efforts to take such further action as any Holder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (a) Rule 144(k) or Rule 144A under the Securities Act, as such rules may be amended from time to time, or (b) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. 8. UNDERWRITTEN REGISTRATIONS. If any of the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers that will manage the offering will be selected by the Holders of a majority (by number of shares) of the Registrable Securities to be included in such offering and will be reasonably acceptable to the Company. 16
No Holder may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder unless such Holder (a) agrees to sell such Holder's Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. 9. BOARD OBSERVATION RIGHTS AND OTHER INFORMATION. PCP shall have the right (i) to attend (or have its affiliated designee attend) all meetings of the board of directors of the Company as a non-voting observer, (ii) receive all distributions of materials and notices given to members of the Company's board of directors and (iii) receive all distributions of materials and notices given to stockholders of the Company; provided, however, that such right will terminate when PCP and PCPMF collectively fail to hold at least 5% of the number of shares of Common Stock (which shall be deemed to include all shares of Common Stock for which any unexercised portion of a Warrant is exercisable) that they collectively held immediately after the Closing Date. All expenses and disbursements incurred or made by PCP related to the exercise of its rights under this Section 9 shall be reimbursed by the Company promptly after demand by PCP. 10. PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS. If the Company offers to issue (an "OFFER") to any Person other than a Holder of a Warrant any additional equity securities (including options, warrants or similar securities) other than Excluded Securities, it shall give each Holder of a Warrant with respect to which a portion thereof remains unexercised (a "WARRANT HOLDER") the right to purchase, on the same terms and conditions as such securities are being offered for sale to such Person, a portion of such securities sufficient to maintain such Holder's percentage ownership in the Company represented by such unexercised Warrant. The Company shall provide written notice to each Warrant Holder of any Offer, which notice shall contain the terms and conditions of the Offer. Each Warrant Holder shall have a period equal to the greater of (i) 15 Business Days from the date such Warrant Holder receives such notice from the Company and (ii) the period of time that such Person will be permitted to accept the Offer, to exercise its right to purchase such securities under this Section 10. A Warrant Holder shall exercise its right by providing written notice to the Company of its intent to purchase and the number of securities which it intends to purchase. Thereafter, such Warrant Holder shall have a period equal to the greater of (i) 10 days from the date such Warrant Holder gives such notice and (ii) the period of time that such Person is required to purchase and pay for securities pursuant to the Offer, to purchase and pay for such securities pursuant to this Section 10. If a Warrant Holder exercises its right to purchase securities pursuant to this Section 10, its obligation to purchase such securities shall be subject to the consummation of the transaction that gave rise to the notice received by such Warrant Holder from the Company. 17
"EXCLUDED SECURITIES" shall mean (i) issuances of up to 150,000 shares of Common Stock upon exercise of warrants of the Company outstanding as of the date hereof, (ii) issuances of equity securities to officers, directors or employees of, or consultants to, the Company as compensation for services, directly or pursuant to a stock option plan or an employee stock purchase plan approved by the Company's board of directors, (iii) issuances of Common Stock or equity-equivalent securities in an offering to the public pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act, (iv) issuances of Common Stock or equity-equivalent securities as a dividend or distribution to stockholders of the Company generally or (v) issuances of Common Stock or equity-equivalent securities in connection with joint ventures or acquisitions, whether by merger, consolidation, purchase of assets, exchange of stock, reorganization, or otherwise. 11. INFORMATION COVENANTS. Until each of PCP and PCPMF has sold or otherwise disposed of its Warrant and Warrant Shares, the Company shall: (a) Make available for inspection by a representative designated by such Person, any underwriter participating in any disposition of such Person's Registrable Securities, or any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by any such Person or underwriter (collectively, the "INSPECTORS"), at the offices where normally kept, during reasonable business hours upon reasonable notice, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and instruments and agreements of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "RECORDS") as shall be reasonably requested by such Inspectors, and cause the officers, directors and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries to supply all information reasonably requested by any such Inspector in connection therewith and to meet with the Inspectors; and (b) Deliver to such Person the financial statements as required pursuant to paragraphs 6A(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) of the Purchase Agreement as in effect on the date hereof, which paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference, except that the obligations of the Company shall be in favor of PCP and PCPMF. 12. MISCELLANEOUS. (a) NO INCONSISTENT AGREEMENTS The Company has not, as of the date hereof, and the Company shall not, after the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement with respect to any of its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. The Company has not entered and will not enter into any agreement with respect to any of its securities that will grant to any Person piggyback registration rights with respect to a Registration Statement. (b) ADJUSTMENTS AFFECTING REGISTRABLE SECURITIES The Company shall not, directly or indirectly, take any action with respect to the Registrable Securities as a class 18
that would adversely affect the ability of the Holders to include Registrable Securities held by them in a registration undertaken pursuant to this Agreement. (c) AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS The provisions of this Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, otherwise than with the prior written consent of the Company and the Holders of not less than a majority (by number of shares) of the Registrable Securities then outstanding; provided, however, that (i) Section 6 and this Section 12(c) may not be amended, modified or supplemented without the prior written consent of the Company and each Holder (including, in the case of an amendment, modification or supplement of Section 6 that would be given retroactive effect, any Person that was a Holder of Registrable Securities disposed of pursuant to any Registration Statement and whose rights under Section 6 would be affected by such amendment, modification or supplement) and (ii) Section 9 may not be amended, modified or supplemented without the prior written consent of PCP. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to depart from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose securities are being sold pursuant to a Registration Statement and that does not directly or indirectly affect, impair, limit or compromise the rights of other Holders may be given by Holders of at least a majority (by number of shares) of the Registrable Securities being sold by such Holders pursuant to the Registration Statement.

ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS Acquisition of Rocky Mountain Holdings, L.L.C. - ---------------------------------------------- On October 16, 2002, Air Methods Corporation (the "Company") acquired 100% of the membership interest of Rocky Mountain Holdings, L.L.C. ("RMH"), a Delaware limited liability company, from Rocky Mountain Holdings, Inc. and AMC Helicopters, Inc. The $28 million cash purchase price for RMH was increased to $33.6 million to reflect increases in net equity since December 31, 2001, which also decreased RMH's indebtedness at closing. RMH's long-term debt and outstanding balances on RMH's line of credit totaled $36.2 million as of September 30, 2002. Except for approximately $1.6 million of RMH debt that was repaid in connection with the acquisition, the long-term debt remains outstanding, either as debt of RMH or as debt assumed or replaced by the Company. The $5 million outstanding balance on the RMH line of credit was rolled into the new revolving credit facility described below. The purchase price is subject to changes in net equity from September 30, 2002, until the date of closing, to be determined by independent audit within 91 days of the closing date, as extended. The purchase price was negotiated by the Company and the sellers, and includes an earn-out provision under which the sellers may receive up to $2.6 million of additional consideration over the next nine years based on actual collections against certain receivables. The Company incurred costs and fees of approximately $1 million in connection with the acquisition, including legal fees of Company counsel and a fee of $750,000 paid to Americas Partners for its services in connection with the acquisition. Ralph Bernstein and Morad Tahbaz, directors of the Company, are partners of Americas Partners. In addition, the Company incurred debt origination fees and expenses of approximately $2.6 million, including fees paid to CIBC World Markets Corp. for investment banking services in arranging the financing for the acquisition and legal fees paid to counsel for the lenders. RMH pioneered the first hospital-based air medical service program over thirty years ago and currently provides air medical transport services throughout the United States under both the community-based and hospital-based service delivery models utilizing a fleet of over 80 helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. RMH also maintains a national dispatch and communications center in Omaha, Nebraska, and aircraft maintenance and overhaul operations at its Provo, Utah headquarters and in Greenville, South Carolina. The Company plans to continue all of RMH's operations and to retain the RMH bases, equipment and air medical transport service personnel. Certain of the RMH administrative functions are planned to be combined with those of the Company. Financing the Acquisition - --------------------------- Subordinated Notes. The purchase price was financed in part through the issuance - ------------------ of $23 million in subordinated notes (the "Notes") to Prudential Capital Partners, L.P. and an affiliate of PCP ("PCP"). Each of the Company and its subsidiaries, RMH, Arch Air Medical Services and Mercy Air Service, is a direct obligor on the Notes and is fully responsible for their payment. The Notes are unsecured and provide for quarterly payment of interest only at 12% per annum, with all principal due October 16, 2007. Except as set forth below, the Notes may not be prepaid until July 1, 2004, and prepayments after July 1, 2004 will be at a declining premium. Up to 25% of the Notes outstanding at closing may be prepaid at any time without premium with the proceeds of an underwritten public equity offering providing net proceeds to the Company of at least $10 million or, if PCP has transferred at least 50% of its Warrants (described below), a private placement of Company equity securities. In addition, the Company may prepay the Notes held by PCP at par upon the occurrence of a Liquidity Event (generally, a sale of all of the Company's equity or assets) if PCP's "cash on cash" return has exceeded 2:1. 1
The purchase agreement entered into in connection with the Note issuance (the "SPA") contains various covenants that limit, among other things, the Company's ability to: - - create liens; - - prepay indebtedness (except in connection with refinancing of Aircraft Indebtedness); - - make certain loans; - - engage in transactions with affiliates on other than arms' length terms; - - make any material change to the nature of the Company's business; - - sell or discount receivables; - - lease real property in excess of specified expenditure levels; - - enter into a merger or consolidation; - - sell assets; or - - pay dividends. With certain exceptions, the Company may not permit the aggregate of (i) new indebtedness, plus (ii) the net present value of future lease payments under newly originated operating leases, plus (iii) Unfinanced Capital Expenditures (as defined) (collectively (i), (ii) and (iii) being referred to as "Capital Debt") to exceed $33 million per year in 2003 and 2004 and $38.5 million per year in 2005 and thereafter. The Company is also subject to a limitation on the amount it may expend in acquisitions without prior consent of the majority of the noteholders ($12.5 million in 2003, $20 million in 2004 and $30 million per year thereafter), which amount may be increased during 2004 and 2005 with 50% of the proceeds of a public equity offering by the Company. The SPA also contains covenants requiring the Company to maintain: - - a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined) of not less than 1:1 for 2003 (increasing thereafter); - - a total debt to EBITDA ratio of not more than 4.05:1.00 (increasing after 3/31/04); - - a minimum net worth; - - a senior debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.05:1.00 (decreasing after 3/31/04); and - - a minimum EBITDA of $26.6 million (increasing after 1/1/04). Payment obligations under the Notes accelerate upon the occurrence of defined events of default, including the following: failure to pay principal or interest or to perform covenants included in the SPA, the senior credit facility or other indebtedness; events of insolvency or bankruptcy, judgments of $500,000 that are not paid or discharged timely; failure to file and keep effective a registration statement relating to the Warrants issued to PCP; and a Change of Control. A Change of Control occurs when (i) any person becomes the beneficial owner of 40% or more of the Company's stock, (ii) directors of the Company at October 16, 2002, or directors approved by them, cease to comprise a majority of the Company's board of directors, (iii) foreign persons in the aggregate own or control 20% or more of the Company's voting stock, or (iv) the Company or any subsidiary that holds an air carrier certificate ceases to be a citizen of the United States. If the Notes are prepaid prior to final maturity, a Yield Maintenance Payment is required that is designed to provide the holders with approximately the same amount of interest they would have received had the Notes been paid at maturity. The Company also issued transferable warrants ("Warrants") to PCP to purchase 443,224 shares of Air Methods Common Stock with an exercise price of $.06 per share, exercisable through October 2008, and entered into a Stockholders' Agreement with PCP. Under the Stockholders' Agreement, the Company is required to file a registration statement by December 30, 2002 registering the common stock underlying the Warrants, to have such registration statement declared effective within 90 days after filing, and to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement continuously thereafter. Failure to satisfy any of these obligations will result in monetary penalties (beginning at $38,333 per month, increasing monthly) and can constitute an event of default under the SPA. One representative of PCP is permitted to participate in all Company board meetings as an observer. If the Company issues equity securities in the future (other than in a public offering), any holder of unexercised Warrants is entitled to pre-emptive rights to participate in that offering to maintain the percentage ownership represented by the unexercised Warrants. 2
Senior Credit Facility. To finance the remainder of the purchase price and - ------------------------ related closing costs and to provide working capital and letter of credit availability for the combined entities, Air Methods entered into a $35 million revolving credit facility with certain lenders, with PNC Bank, National Association (PNC) acting as agent. Borrowings under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of the Company's non-aircraft assets, including accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and general intangibles. Indebtedness under the credit facility will have a first priority claim to the assets pledged to secure it. The Company and its three subsidiaries are each a direct obligor on the credit facility. The facility matures October 16, 2006 but can be prepaid at any time, subject to payment of an early termination fee ranging from .25% to 2% if the termination occurs prior to October 16, 2004. Indebtedness under the credit facility will bear interest, at the Company's option, at either (i) the higher of the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or the prime rate as announced by PNC plus an applicable margin ranging from 0 to 0.75% or (ii) at a rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.75% to 3.00%. The applicable margin in each case is based upon the ratio of senior debt (as defined in the credit facility) to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facility) for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters. The amount of borrowing permitted under the credit facility is based on a borrowing base comprised of (i) 75% of accounts receivable from Medicare, Medicaid, insurance companies and community-based payors and 85% of other accounts receivable, and (ii) the lesser of (A) 60% of inventory valued at the lower of cost or market, (B) 85% of inventory valued at liquidation value, or (C) $15 million. Based on assets at the time of the closing, approximately $33.6 million was available under the credit facility, and borrowings under the credit facility at closing were approximately $16 million, leaving approximately $17.6 million of unused borrowing availability. The credit facility contains various covenants that limit, among other things, the Company's ability to: - - create liens; - - declare dividends; - - make loans and investments; - - enter into real property leases exceeding specified expenditure levels; - - make any material change to the nature of the Company's business; - - enter into any transaction with affiliates other than on arms' length terms; - - prepay indebtedness, except in connection with refinancing Aircraft Indebtedness or, with respect to the Notes issued to PCP, with proceeds of equity issuances; - - enter into a merger or consolidation; or - - sell assets. The credit agreement also contains covenants requiring the Company to maintain: - - a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.1:1.00 (increasing after 1/1/04); and - - a minimum net worth. With certain exceptions the Company may not permit its Capital Debt to exceed $30 million per year in 2003 and 2004 and $35 million per year in 2005 and 2006. Under the credit facility the Company may not expend more than $10 million per year for acquisitions without prior consent of the majority of the member banks, and debt incurred in any acquisition must be less than twice the cash purchase price. No acquisition may occur without prior consent unless there is $10 million of undrawn availability under the credit facility. Payment obligations under the credit facility accelerate upon the occurrence of defined events of default, including the following: failure to pay principal or interest, or to perform covenants, under the credit facility, the Notes or other indebtedness; events of insolvency or bankruptcy; judgments of $250,000 are not paid or discharged timely; failure to maintain the first priority status of liens under the credit facility; levy against a material portion of the Company's assets; default under the Notes; suspension of material governmental permits; interruption of operations at any Company facility that has a material adverse effect; and a Change of Control (which has the same definition in the credit facility as in the SPA). 3

ROCKY MOUNTAIN HOLDINGS, L.L.C. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: ----------------------------------------------------------- Organization and Description of Business ---------------------------------------- Rocky Mountain Holdings, L.L.C. (the Company), a Delaware limited liability company, is in the air medical transport services business, providing air medical transport services to hospitals and regional ambulance authorities primarily throughout the United States of America. All business of the Company is conducted under the Company's name and the trade names "Rocky Mountain Helicopters," "LifeNet," "LifeCom," "MedFlight," "Complete Billing Solutions," "The Wisdom Well," and "Advantage Aviation." The Company is owned equally by the members, AMC Helicopters, Inc. and Rocky Mountain Holdings, Inc. (the Members) under an agreement that unless terminated earlier by the Members will dissolve the Company on December 31, 2024. Revenue Recognition -------------------- Revenue is recognized at the time services are rendered or products are shipped and title passes to the customer. Cash Concentration ------------------- The Company's cash is held in two banks, one in Utah and one in Pennsylvania, the balances of which may at times exceed federally insured limits. Inventories ----------- Inventories consist of purchased and overhauled parts, accessories and supplies, primarily consumed in the maintenance and repair or modification of the Company's aircraft. Rotable inventories include components that are repaired and reused as opposed to those parts that are consumed in operations, and are depreciated over 15 years. The cost of creating a usable rotary inventory component is capitalized. The cost of repairing rotable inventories is charged to expense as incurred. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined on the basis of average cost. Except for serialized parts for which actual cost is used. Property and Equipment ------------------------ Property and equipment are stated at cost. Equipment under capital leases is recorded at the lesser of the fair value of the asset or the present value of minimum lease payments. Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated on the straight-line method over the useful lives of the related assets and considers salvage value of the related asset. Equipment under capital leases and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the equipment. Continued 6
ROCKY MOUNTAIN HOLDINGS, L.L.C. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Continued: ------------------------------------------------------------- Major additions, betterments and renewals are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs, including major overhauls, are charged to operating expenses as they are incurred. Depreciation and amortization are computed over the following useful lives: Helicopters and aircraft 15 - 25 years Leasehold improvements - helicopters 7 years Operational and office equipment 3-5 years Buildings 30 years At the time assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the related accounts and the difference, net of proceeds, is recorded as a gain or loss. Goodwill and Deferred Financing Costs ----------------------------------------- Goodwill is recorded at cost and is amortized on a straight-line basis over 15 years. Deferred financing costs are amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method. In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 ("SFAS 141"), Business Combinations, and No 142 ("SFAS 142"), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after June 30, 2001. SFAS 141 also specifies criteria that must be met in order for intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. SFAS 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142. SFAS 142 also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144 ("SFAS 144"), Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 141 immediately and SFAS 142 effective January 1, 2002. The adoption of SFAS 142, including the transitional impairment test, were completed and did not have a significant effect on the Company's 2002 financial statements. Continued 7
ROCKY MOUNTAIN HOLDINGS, L.L.C. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Continued: ------------------------------------------------------------- Impairment of Long-Lived Assets ---------------------------------- Management periodically reviews long-lived assets, for possible impairment. Recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the Company's long-lived assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated from the assets. No impairment has been recognized in the accompanying financial statements. Income Taxes ------------- As a limited liability company that is treated for income tax purposes as a partnership, the allocated share of the Company's federal and state taxable income or loss for each year is included in the income tax returns of the Members. Use of Estimates ------------------ The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management of the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Accounts receivable balances from one of the Company's lines of business are subject to a significant risk of uncollectiblity. Management continually estimates the provision for doubtful accounts by performing extensive analytical procedures. The actual collection results of these receivables could differ significantly from management's estimates. New Accounting Standards -------------------------- The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, on January 1, 2001. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant effect on the Company's financial statements. In August 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143 ("SFAS 143"), Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which addresses the accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated retirement costs. SFAS 143 is effective for the Company January 1, 2003. The Company has evaluated the impact of this standard and does not believe its adoption will have a significant effect on the Company's financial statements. Continued 8
ROCKY MOUNTAIN HOLDINGS, L.L.C. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Continued: ------------------------------------------------------------- In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which addresses the accounting and reporting for the impairment and disposal of long-lived assets. The Company has adopted SFAS No. 144 effective January 1, 2002 and such adoption did not have a significant effect on its financial statements. In May 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections as of April 2002. The Company has evaluated the impact of this standard and does not believe its adoption will have a significant effect on the Company's financial statements. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred, rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, discontinued operation, plant closing, or other exit or disposal activity. Previous accounting guidance was provided by Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). SFAS No. 146 replaces EITF No. 94-3, and is required to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 146 will have a significant effect on its financial statements. Reclassifications ----------------- Certain balances in the 2001 and 2000 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the September 30, 2002 (unaudited) presentation. These changes had no effect on total assets, total liabilities, and members' equity or net income. Interim Financial Data ------------------------ The interim financial data as of September 30, 2002 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 and 2001 is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the Company, the interim data includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods.

In addition, as of September 30, 2002, the deposit and related note payable associated with this commitment totaled $424,000 (unaudited). 11. Subsequent Events: ------------------ In June 2002, the Company and its members entered into a Definitive Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") to sell 100% of the membership interests in the Company to Air Methods Corporation. The Agreement provides for a cash purchase price of $28,000,000 due at closing, subject to customary closing and post-closing adjustments. Additional consideration of up to $2,600,000 is possible through earn-out provisions set forth in the Agreement, which, if earned, would be paid out over the next nine years. In April 1996, the Members of the Company created the Senior Management Incentive Program (the "EAR Plan"). Under the EAR Plan, participating members of management of the Company were issued certain "Equity Appreciation Rights", which entitle them to receive compensation based on the "increase in equity" of the Company as defined by the EAR Plan. However, payment of this compensation is contingent upon the occurrence of a "Liquidating Event" as defined by the EAR Plan. In accordance with the EAR Plan, the Agreement signed in June of 2002 between the Company's members and Air Methods Corporation for the purchase of the membership interests of the Company constituted a "Liquidating Event" under the EAR Plan. As a result, the EAR Plan participants were paid, by the members, approximately $881,000 in October 2002 and $59,000 in November 2002. An additional $408,000 is expected to be paid in January 2003. For the nine-months ending September 30, 2002 the Company recorded $1,348,000 (unaudited) of compensation expense and a corresponding contribution of capital from members relating to these EAR payments. In addition, based on future events an additional amount of up to $323,000 may be paid out over the next nine-years. 16
Air Methods Corporation and Subsidiaries Pro Forma Financial Information (unaudited) The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet presents the historical financial information of Air Methods Corporation (the Company), as of September 30, 2002, as adjusted for the acquisition of Rocky Mountain Holdings LLC (RMH), as if the transaction had occurred on September 30, 2002. The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, and the year ended December 31, 2001, combine the historical operations of the Company with the historical operations of RMH as if the transaction had occurred on January 1, 2001. The acquisition will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the acquisition cost will be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on fair values. The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements have been prepared by the Company's management based upon the historical financial statements of the Company and RMH and preliminary estimates of fair values, which are subject to change pending a final analysis of the fair values. These pro forma statements may not be indicative of the results that actually would have occurred if the combination had been in effect on the dates indicated or which may be obtained in the future. The pro forma financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements included in the Company's previous filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and RMH financial statements included herein.
AIR METHODS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (1) BASIS OF PRESENTATION ----------------------- The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are presented to reflect the acquisition of RMH by the Company using the purchase method of accounting whereby the acquisition cost will be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their fair values. The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet presents the historical financial information of the Company, as of September 30, 2002, as adjusted for the acquisition of RMH, as if the transaction had occurred on September 30, 2002. The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, and the year ended December 31, 2001, combine the historical operations of the Company with the historical operations of RMH as if the transaction had occurred on January 1, 2001. Certain reclassifications have been made to the historical RMH financial statement presentation to conform to the Company's basis of presentation. Bad debt expense is shown as a component of operating expenses in the Company's statements of operations, rather than as a reduction to revenue, as presented in the RMH historical financial statements. These pro forma statements may not be indicative of the results that actually would have occurred if the combination had been in effect on the dates indicated or which may be obtained in the future. The Company has commenced workforce reductions subsequent to the acquisition and expects general and administrative expenses to decrease in excess of $2,500,000 annually as a result. (2) PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS ----------------------- The purchase price of RMH totaled $36,200,000, including contingent consideration, and was allocated to the RMH aircraft based on preliminary estimates of fair value which are subject to change based on a final analysis of fair values. The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements reflect the following adjustments: (a) Eliminate RMH goodwill balance as of September 30, 2002. (b) Eliminate RMH equity balances as of September 30, 2002. (c) Record revolving credit facility draw downs used to finance the acquisition and the related interest expense at 4.75%. A change of 1/8% in the interest rate would result in a $15,000 change in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, and $20,000 change for the year ended December 31, 2001. The revolving credit facility provides for draw downs, up to a maximum of $35,000,000, which bear interest, at the Company's option, at either the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5% or a rate based upon the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin, which may range from 1.75% to 3.0%. (d) Record the issuance of $23,000,000 of subordinated notes to finance the acquisition and the related interest expense. The notes are unsecured and bear interest at an annual rate of 12%. (e) Record the issuance of stock purchase warrants to acquire 443,224 shares of the Company's common stock for nominal consideration and the related amortization as additional interest expense. The warrants were granted in connection with the issuance of the $23,000,000 subordinated notes and were recorded as a discount to the notes. (f) Record the amount of additional consideration that the Company believes is probable to be paid to the sellers dependent upon certain RMH future cash receipts. (g) Eliminate accumulated depreciation and adjust RMH fixed assets to estimated fair market value based on the acquisition.
AIR METHODS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED (UNAUDITED) (h) Record estimated income tax provision using a 39% effective corporate tax rate. Prior to the acquisition, RMH was a limited liability corporation, and net income was taxable directly to its shareholders. Because the acquisition was accounted for as an asset purchase for income tax purposes, no deferred tax asset or liability was recorded on the balance sheet related to the transaction. (i) Record the payoff of certain debt of RMH and the Company at the date of the acquisition. Eliminate related interest expense. (j) Eliminate certain management fees paid by RMH to the sellers prior to the acquisition. (k) Record estimated costs incurred in connection with the acquisition consisting of $2,600,000 of debt origination costs and $1,000,000 of transaction closing costs. (l) Record beginning accrued overhaul and parts replacement reserve for RMH aircraft fleet to conform to accrual method of accounting used by the Company. (m) Eliminate expenses incurred by RMH during the nine months ended September 30, 2002, in connection with the acquisition, including equity appreciation rights expenses resulting from acquisition. (n) Eliminate amortization of RMH goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2001. (o) Record estimated severance payments to RMH employees terminated after the acquisition. (p) Record estimated future repair costs on aircraft or aircraft parts being repaired or overhauled at the date of acquisition. (q) Adjust depreciation to reflect the change in the acquired aircraft basis and an average estimated remaining life of 15 years. (r) Eliminate sales of medical interiors from the Company to RMH. (s) Record amortization of debt origination costs over the terms of the debt agreements. (3) INCOME PER SHARE ------------------ Pro forma basic earnings per share is computed by dividing pro forma net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Pro forma diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing pro forma net income by all common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period, including the effect of the warrants issued in connection with the acquisition.

EXHIBIT 99.1 AIR METHODS - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company AIR METHODS REPORTS 1Q2003 RESULTS Net Loss of $(0.05) Per Share In Line with Previously Announced Expectations DENVER, CO., May 13, 2003 -- Air Methods Corporation (NASDAQ: AIRM) reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2003. Revenue increased 105% to $54.0 million from $26.3 million in the year ago period. The Company reported a net loss of $(516,000) or $(0.05) per basic and diluted share as compared with prior year period net income of $1.7 million or $0.19 per basic and diluted share. The net loss was within the expected range disclosed by the Company in April. George Belsey, Chairman and CEO, stated, "As previously disclosed, our first quarter results were adversely affected by severe weather throughout the country, particularly in February. In addition, the prior year first quarter benefited from unusually benign weather conditions, creating greater fluctuation when comparing the two quarters. While our January and March bottom line results were stronger than budgeted expectations, the net loss posted in February offset earnings generated during the first and third months of the quarter." Compared to the year ago quarter, community-based operations revenue increased 112% to $31.4 million, while its divisional net income decreased 76% to $523,000 from $2.2 million. Hospital-based operations revenue increased 108% to $21.0 million, while divisional net income decreased 23% to $939,000 from $1.2 million. Decreases in divisional net income for both divisions were primarily attributed to decreases in flight volume described above. External revenue for the Products Division decreased slightly from $1.5 million to $1.3 million in the current year quarter, while divisional net income from external projects decreased from $366,000 to $192,000. Decreases in both external revenue and net income for the division were attributed to a reduced backlog beginning in 2003 and reduced margins due to changes in product line mix during the quarter. Mr. Belsey added, "The Company continues to project growth in 2003 net income of greater than 20% despite the weather conditions which hampered first quarter performance. Although weather cancellations were higher in April 2003 as compared with April 2002, flight volume within the community-based operations was 18% higher than the first quarter monthly average. With typically more favorable weather conditions during summer months, we look forward to a strong rebound in our financial performance during the remainder of the year. In addition, the Company now anticipates a new purchase order for 11 HH-60L Multi-Mission Medevac Systems during the second quarter, further enhancing the financial outlook for the Products Division during the remainder of 2003." Air Methods Corporation (www.airmethods.com) is a leader in emergency ------------------ aeromedical transportation, medical services and technology. The Air Medical Services Division is the largest provider of air medical transport services for hospitals in the United States. The Mercy Air subsidiary and LifeNet division create the largest community-based provider of air medical services.

AIRM ------ NASDAQ LISTED [GRAPHIC OMITTED] FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS: This news release includes certain forward- looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors, including but not limited to the size, structure and growth of the Company's air medical services and products markets; the continuation and/or renewal of air medical service contracts; the acquisition of profitable Products Division contracts and other flight service operations; the successful expansion of the community-based operations; successful integration of RMH operations and other matters set forth in the Company's public filings.

AIR METHODS CORPORATION Date: August 6, 2003 By \s\ Trent Carman -------------------------------------- On behalf of the Company, and as Chief Financial Officer

EXHIBIT 99.1 AIR METHODS - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company AIR METHODS ANNOUNCES ANTICIPATED SECOND QUARTER RESULTS Significantly Higher Weather Cancellations Impact Flight Volume DENVER, CO., July 22, 2003 -- Air Methods Corporation (NASDAQ: AIRM), the world's largest air medical transportation company, today provided an update of anticipated financial results for its second quarter that ended June 30, 2003. As previously disclosed, weather cancellations were higher in April as compared with the prior year. This pattern continued deep into June resulting in significantly higher weather cancellations for the entire quarter. For community-based programs in operation during both the current and prior year second quarters, weather cancellations were 487 transports higher than in the prior year quarter, a 53% increase. Despite the increase in missed flights, the Company is anticipating net income per basic share for the quarter between $0.12 and $0.15, only slightly below the prior year quarter. This expectation is subject to change pending final closing entries and quarterly review by the Company's independent auditors. "The severe weather during our second quarter impacted primarily our operations in the midwest, east and southeast locations," commented Aaron Todd, Air Methods' chief executive officer. "Typically, weather patterns that prohibit flight activity begin to moderate earlier in the second quarter. We did not see more typical summer conditions until late June this year. Since a majority of our operating costs are fixed in nature, flight volume shortfalls, especially within our community-based operations, have a significant impact on earnings." Mr. Todd continued, "With these increased weather cancellations impacting operations deep into the second quarter, our ability to achieve our beginning of the year objective to grow net income by 20% is now improbable. However, we are very optimistic about achieving strong growth in earnings during the second half of 2003. To date, July flight volume projects an improvement of 9% over June, reflecting a return to more normal summer weather conditions. In addition, the Company was successful in securing sizeable reductions in insurance costs effective July 1st and has achieved most of its cost reduction initiatives specific to integrating Rocky Mountain Holdings, L.L.C. (RMH). Finally, improvement in operating results from the Products Division is anticipated due to a recent purchase order received for 11 HH-60L Multi-Mission Medevac Systems for which production commenced during the third quarter. These factors support the Company's internal projections of earnings growth in excess of 20% for the remainder of the year. These projections assume, however, a return to more normal weather patterns and are subject to other risk factors disclosed in our public filings." Mr. Todd concluded, "Despite these weather challenges, we are very pleased with the integration of RMH. We have realized great efficiency within our operations, including price reductions attributed to greater purchasing power and decreases in overhead costs. We have continued to grow our business at an unprecedented level, especially within the community-based operations. We have expanded to six new locations within this division since finalizing the acquisition of RMH last October. We believe these factors position Air Methods to generate strong financial performance in the future."

EXHIBIT 99.1 [GRAPHIC OMITED] [GRAPHIC OMITED] - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company AIR METHODS ANNOUNCES 2ND QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS BASIC EPS OF $0.14 IN LINE WITH PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED EXPECTATIONS DENVER, CO, August 12, 2003 -- Air Methods Corporation (NasdaqNM: AIRM) reported financial results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2003. For the quarter, revenue increased 107% to $57.5 million from $27.8 million in the prior-year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $1.3 million, $0.14 per basic share and $0.13 per diluted share, compared to $1.4 million, $0.15 per basic and diluted share, for the prior-year quarter. Net income per share was within the expected range disclosed by the Company in July 2003. Earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses ("EBITDA") increased 67% to $6.9 million from $4.1 million in the prior-year quarter. For the six-month period, revenue increased 103% to $110 million, up from $54.1 million in the prior-year six-month period. Net income for the six-month period was $0.8 million ($0.08 per basic and diluted share) compared to $3.1 million ($0.35 per basic and $0.34 per diluted share) for the prior-year six-month period. EBITDA increased 24% to $10.8 million from $8.7 million in the prior-year six-month period. Aaron Todd, Air Methods' chief executive officer, stated, "As previously disclosed, our second quarter financial performance was significantly impacted by weather cancellations, which were 53% higher as compared with the same locations in the prior-year second quarter, for our community-based operations. The Company's ability to sustain earnings during a significantly more severe weather quarter would indicate the acquisition and integration of Rocky Mountain Holdings is having a positive influence on our consolidated operations." SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Community-Based Operations: Revenue from community-based operations increased 119% to $33.6 million, and segment net income increased 30% to $2.7 million during the second quarter, as compared with the prior-year quarter. These increases are primarily the result of the acquisition of Rocky Mountain Holdings, LLC ("RMH") in October 2002 and to the opening of new bases in Tucson, AZ.; Huntsville, AL.; Augusta, GA.; Tallahassee, FL. and Effingham, IL. As referenced above, earnings did not keep pace with revenue growth because of an increase in missed transports caused by weather. Hospital-Based Operations: Revenue from hospital-based operations increased 107% to $22.1 million, and segment net income increased 128% to $1.6 million during the second quarter as compared with the prior-year quarter. The increase in earnings is consistent with the increase in revenue attributed to the RMH acquisition. In addition, prior-year divisional earnings were impacted by unfavorable budget variances in maintenance expense that exceeded $400,000. Maintenance expenses for the division were within budget expectations during the current year quarter.
Products Division: Revenue generated by the Products Division increased 36% to $2.5 million, while segment net income decreased 49% to $222,000 during the second quarter as compared with the prior-year quarter. The decrease in earnings was attributed to higher engineering and documentation costs associated with installation of modular interiors on new aircraft types, which resulted in lower project profit margins. Costs associated with consolidating production functions in Denver following the RMH acquisition also contributed to the reduced margins. Mr. Todd added, "We anticipate improved financial performance during the second half of 2003 due to numerous factors, including the recent expansion within community-based operations, our new contract to produce eleven (11) HH-60L Multi-Mission Medevac Systems commencing in the third quarter, the decrease in insurance rates effective July 1st, and the near-completion of the integration plan for RMH. With July flight volume reflecting slightly lower weather cancellations than July 2002, we are also hopeful that weather will be more moderate during the second half of the year." Aaron Todd and Trent J. Carman, CFO, will review the Company's second-quarter results with interested parties via a web cast/conference call to be held Tuesday, August 12, 2003 at 4:15 p.m. Eastern.

EXHIBIT 99.1 (AIR METHODS LOGO) - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company AIR METHODS ANNOUNCES 3RD QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS Basic EPS of $0.28 and Revenue of $67.0 million Reflect Historical Highs for a Quarter DENVER, CO, November 4, 2003 -- Air Methods Corporation (NASDAQ: AIRM) reported revenue and net income for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2003. For the quarter, revenue increased 132% to $67.0 million compared to $28.9 million in the prior-year period. Net income increased 182% to $2.7 million, $0.28 per basic and $0.27 per diluted share, compared to prior-year net income of $1.0 million, $0.10 per basic and diluted share. For the nine months, revenue increased 113% to $176.7 million compared to $83.0 million for the prior-year period. Net income decreased 14% to $3.5 million, $0.36 per basic and $0.35 per diluted share, compared to prior-year net income of $4.1 million, $0.45 per basic and $0.44 per diluted share. This decrease was largely attributed to an increase in missed transports due to weather during the first half of 2003. Results include operations of Rocky Mountain Holdings, LLC (RMH) since acquisition in October 2002. Aaron Todd, Chief Executive Officer, said, "These strong financial results reflect a return to more moderate weather patterns during our third quarter, combined with improved operational efficiencies as the Company grew closer to completing its integration plans for RMH. For the quarter, the Company realized growth in both revenue and segment net income within its community-based and hospital-based operations. The benefits of last year's acquisition of RMH are evident as our quarterly results reflect all-time highs in both revenue and net income." THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS: o Community-Based Operations: Community-based services revenue increased 163% to $42.0 million from $16.0 million, while segment net income increased 211% to $3.9 million from $1.2 million in the prior-year quarter. Total patient transports for the quarter were 7,142 as compared with 2,890 in the prior-year quarter. For bases in operation greater than one year, including RMH community-bases (Same-Base Transports), cancelled patient transports due to weather were 174 higher than during the prior-year quarter. Bad debt expense as a percentage of community-based revenue was 24.2% for both the current-year quarter and the prior-year quarter. o Hospital-Based Operations: Revenue from hospital-based operations increased by 106% to $23.1 million from $11.2 million, while segment net income increased by 146% to $2.3 million from $0.9 million. o Products Division: The Products Division reported external revenue of $1.7 million and segment net income (excluding internal sales) of $537,000 for the quarter compared to $1.8 million and $426,000 respectively, for the prior-year period.
"We remain very optimistic about the remainder of the year and beyond. Flight volume from our community-based operations in October benefited from favorable weather patterns. Patients transported within this division were 2,453, reflecting a 24% increase for Same-Base Transports, including RMH bases. Additionally, the Company expects to commence services at several new bases during the remainder of 2003 and early part of 2004," said Todd.

AIR METHODS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET (Amounts in thousands)
AIR METHODS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts)

EXHIBIT 99.2 The following are excerpts from the Air Methods Corporation conference call on November 4, 2003, regarding financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2003. The excerpts contain information to be furnished under Item 12. .. . . . Trent Carman: . . . . For the third quarter of 2003, revenue increased $38.1 million, or 132 percent, to $67 million. Acquisition of Rocky Mountain Holdings in October 2002 accounted for $34.5 million of this increase, and six new community bases generated $3.8 million of revenue. Patient transports for the third quarter of 2003 for our community-based operations were 7,142. This represents a 13 percent increase over the second quarter of 2003's transport volume of 6,307 and 147 percent increase over the third quarter of 2002 transport volume of 2,890. We experienced an increase in weather-related flight cancellations during the third quarter of 2003. For our community-based operations open during the third quarter of both 2003 and 2002, weather cancellations increased in 2003 by 174 transports, or 18 percent, over same-base weather cancellations in 2002. For these same bases, patient transports during the third quarter of 2003 were virtually the same as the second quarter of 2002. On average, our average net revenue for transport - which is gross revenue less Medicare/Medicaid discounts and bad-debt expense - was $4,454 for the third quarter of 2003. This compares to $4,445 for the second quarter of 2003. For the third quarter 2003, the company generated $2.7 million of net income, representing 28 cents and 27 cents for basic and fully diluted share respectively. This compares to net income for the third quarter of 2002 of $1 million, representing 10 cents per basic and fully diluted share. For the third quarter 2003 and 2002, bad debt - the percentage of community-based flight revenue was 24 percent. It's important to note for financial statement purposes, revenue in our P&L is recorded net of applicable Medicare and Medicaid discounts. Earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization were $9.5 million for the third quarter of 2003. This represents a 180 percent increase over the third quarter of 2002's earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization of $3.4 million. It's important to note that our calculation is net income plus interest expense plus depreciation and amortization plus income tax expense. The company's net position - which is the total of all indebtedness less cash on the balance sheet of $3.2 million - was approximately $89 million at September 30th, 2003. This compares to $89.4 million at June 30th, 2003, and $87.9 million at December 31, 2002. At September 30th, 2003, we had $13.1 million of excess availability under our line of credit. At September 30th, 2003, our net current position - which is current assets less current liabilities - was $38.2 million, which compares to $34.8 million at June 30th, 2003, and $28.6 million at December 31, 2002. At September 30th, 2003, our trade receivables were $72.9 million, and our allowance for doubtful accounts, $17.8 million. Our average day sales outstanding at September 30th, 2003, based upon the gross trade receivable balance, were 100 days. This compares to 101 days sales outstanding at June 30th, 2003. As a result of more favorable weather and the opening of six new bases, patient transports in October 2003 increased approximately 41 percent over October 2002. For our bases open during October 2003 and 2002, our transports increased 23 percent. At September 30th, 2003, the company operated a total of 175 aircraft. One hundred and three of these were in our hospital-based operations and 72 were in our community-based operations. The company currently operates 55 community bases and has 50 hospital contracts. .. . . . Devlin Lander: Hi. Just a few questions. Can you give us what the operating margins were by division?
Trent Carman: Operating margins by division for the third quarter only? Devlin Lander: Yes. Trent Carman: This would include all of the G&A applicable to the division - the divisional overhead, if you will - and the flight operation expenses. For the community-based operations - this is going to be pre-depreciation-and-amortization, if that's OK. Devlin Lander: Yes. Trent Carman: - and interest. We allocate interest expense, as well, Devlin, just so you're aware. Devlin Lander: OK. .. . . . Trent Carman: Devlin, that's about 15 percent for the community-based operation for the third quarter. For the hospital, it would be 19 percent. Aaron Todd: Trent, can you offer those percentages relative to the segment footnote? Trent Carman: That's what - that's what I'm using, is the segment footnote. Aaron Todd: Can you go ahead and show those just as - based on divisional net income as a percentage of revenue? I think that's a meaningful measure, as well. Trent Carman: Segment net income - which is - as Aaron mentioned, is disclosed in our segment footnote is - for the community-based operations is nine percent - 9.25 percent, to be precise. And the hospital is 9.9 percent. .. . . . Operator: And we'll take our next question from Phil Rhodes, with MRI. Phil Rhodes: I had two questions. The first one involved the bad-debt expense of approximately 24 percent. And my, I guess, lack of knowledge as to what you folks are expecting on a quarter or year-by-year basis - I just don't know what to expect there. Is that considered to be a high number as far as you folks are concerned? Aaron Todd: You know, let me start off with this one, Trent, and then you can supplement my comments. The problem with trying to peg bad debt as a percentage of net revenues is that changes in payer mix between Medicare/Medicaid and other results in a - one is a subtraction or a reduction of revenue, and the other one is disclosed as a component of bad-debt expense. And so you're going to see a fluctuation in that percentage within a - you know, historically, it's been at plus or minus three to five percent, merely - partially because you do see changes in overall reimbursement rates based upon economic environments, but you also see flip-flop in payer mix between Medicare/Medicaid patients that are discounted against revenue versus other patients that we are looking from reimbursement from them or their insurance company. And that is a component of bad debt, if it goes uncollected. So I guess what I would say relative to the third quarter, it's exactly on target with where we were the year before. I think we have historically said that somewhere in that 20 to 25 percent range is typically the range that we come in at. Every once in a while, we'll be a little lower than that, and certainly we can come in above that range. But that is the range that we have typically seen historically. Trent, anything to add there? Trent Carman: Yes, the only thing there, Aaron, is, as you mentioned, the average transport, which net of Medicare/Medicaid and the bad debt, for the quarter, Phil, was $4,454. That compares to $4,445 with the second quarter of 2003. So you can see that the bad-debt percentage in the second quarter was only 17 percent, whereas it was 24 in the third quarter. Year-to-date, it's 21 percent. The important thing there, though, is the net reimbursement that we get is approximately the same dollar amount.
Phil Rhodes: Yes. And the net reimbursement that we're talking about, and the term "bad debt" - I think I understand a lot better about the nature of the classification of bad debt because I think probably we're speaking - you're speaking about a common usage of a term and I was thinking about just people who could not, you know, pay the billings. And actually, yours is a great deal - has a great deal to do with the adjustments due to Medicare and Medicaid. So I do understand that a little bit better. Trent Carman: You know, the number in the financial statement - just to clarify that, Phil, the bad-debt expense in the P&L is only for those non-payers. Any discount for Medicare/Medicaid is netted off on the revenue number. But that - the number I gave you - the $4,454, that is the net after both items are subtracted there. Operator: And we'll take our next question from Barry Sine, with HD Brous. .. . . . Barry Sine: The other area that I wanted to ask a little more about is on the product division. I notice that your revenue was somewhat consistent with the prior quarter. And you've had a good volume of contract announcements over the last several months. When are we likely to see - what's the timing of some of these contracts you've already announced, when we'll see them flow into revenue? Trent Carman: What we've got now, Barry, is about $5.5 million of backlog, if you will, with the product division. Those relate to the contract you're mentioning primarily and a couple of smaller ones. The revenue that we will recognize through our financial statements or the time period that'll take for this $5.5 million to come through our financials will probably be the fourth quarter and through the entire year of next year. Some of these projects with the government have a long lead time and many units being delivered, so they're being phased in. But you'll see the $5.5 million between the fourth quarter of this year and then pretty pro rata, if you will, during 2004. Barry Sine: So if I divide that over five quarters, that's about a - $1.1 million a quarter. Aaron Todd: Barry, I would guess that you probably should weight it towards the initial quarters because what'll happen is, for example, with the Black Hawk interiors, you know, those, you know, deliver so much each month. But you're many times doing lot fabrications, et cetera, which increases the revenue recognition early on. So - and then, of course, some of these deliver in that period of time - I mean, in the fourth and first quarter. So you're - I would weight it towards the - you should probably weight it towards the fourth and first quarters with a tail in the second through fourth quarters of 2004. .. . . . Operator: And we'll take our next question from Brian Black with Lamb Partners. Brian Black: the interest expense ticked up by, like, a quarter million bucks versus Q2. Is that just due to a floating rate component of the credit line, or, you know ... .. . . . Trent Carman: The majority of our debt, if you take a look at it, you got the $23 million, the 12 percent interest rate, you've got a revolver which is between 15 and $17 million at any one day, basically, and that floats with LIBOR plus approximately two-and-a-half percent. And then you've got the rest of the debt, excluding capital leases, which is primarily debt on our aircraft. About half of our fleet is financed with promissory notes; the other half, approximately, is financed via operating leases. But the aircraft debt is all fixed. Those have terms that range between seven-plus-or-minus-percent all the way up to a little bit higher than that. So the majority of our debt is in fact fixed, if you will, with again, the exception, the PNC revolver.
Now, the reason for the increase would be due to partially the build-up in the receivables that we've been talking about here during the second quarter associated with the new bases. So the debt pay-downs were not, certainly, as high as one would have expected. .. . . . Operator: And we'll next go to Elliot Lepler with Lepler & Levy Investments. .. . . . Elliot Lepler: I wonder if you could share with me how this quarter compared with your internal budgets. I know it was a very good quarter, but it's not clear to me whether this was an especially good quarter or a under-average quarter or just an average quarter. Trent Carman: I would characterize it, Elliot, that within our internal projections or the revised budgets that we have, we don't expect to have any real changes in the weather cancellation year over year. And as I mentioned in my script, we had an increase of about 174 weather increases for the community-based model that were - would not have been anticipated internally. The overall transports were pretty much in line excluding that. The one line item that would probably not have been as favorable - although it would be somewhat - wouldn't be that material, would be the repairs and maintenance. We would have been slightly over budget there. But all in all, it was - it was pretty close to what we were anticipating, excluding those two items.

ITEM 5.

For purposes of this Agreement: ----------- (a) Form S-3. The term "Form S-3" means such form under the --------- -------- Act as is in effect on the date hereof or any successor registration form under the Act subsequently adopted by the Commission that permits inclusion or incorporation of substantial information by reference to other documents filed by the Company with the Commission. (b) Holder. The term "Holders" shall mean holders of ------ ------- Registrable Securities that have registration rights pursuant to this Agreement. (c) Registration. The terms "register," "registered," and ------------ -------- ---------- "registration" refer to a registration effected by preparing and filing a ------------ registration statement in compliance with the Act, and the declaration or ordering of effectiveness of such registration statement. (d) Registrable Securities. The term "Registrable ----------------------- ----------- Securities" means: (1) all of the Purchased Shares, (2) any additional shares issued pursuant to Section 7.2(a) and (3) any shares of Common Stock of the Company issued or issuable, from time to time, upon any reclassification, share combination, share subdivision, stock split, share dividend, or similar transaction or event, or otherwise as a distribution on, in exchange for or with respect to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that the term "Registrable Securities" shall exclude in all events (and such securities shall not constitute "Registrable Securities") (i) any Registrable Securities sold or transferred by a person in a transaction in which the registration rights granted under this Agreement are not assigned in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (ii) any Registrable Securities sold in a public offering pursuant to a registration statement filed with the Commission or sold pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Act ("Rule 144"). --------- (e) Prospectus. The term "Prospectus" shall mean the ---------- ---------- prospectus included in any Shelf Registration Statement (including, without limitation, a prospectus that discloses information previously omitted from a prospectus filed as part of an effective registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A promulgated under the Act), as amended or supplemented by any prospectus supplement (including, without limitation, any prospectus supplement with respect to the terms of the offering of any portion of the Registrable Securities 13
covered by such Shelf Registration Statement), and all other amendments and supplements to the Prospectus, including post-effective amendments, and all material incorporated by reference or deemed to be incorporated by reference in such Prospectus. (f) Shelf Registration Statement. See Section 7.2(a). ------------------------------ 7.2 Form S-3 Shelf Registration. ------------------------------ (a) Registration. The Company shall prepare and file with ------------ the Commission as soon as practicable but in any event within thirty (30) days following the Closing and use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to have declared effective as soon as practicable thereafter (but in any event within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date), a registration statement on Form S-3 (or, if the Company is not then eligible to use Form S-3, then another appropriate form) providing for the resale by the Holders of all of the Registrable Securities (the "Shelf Registration Statement"), and (ii) to provide ---------------------------- a transfer agent and registrar for all securities registered pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement. The Shelf Registration Statement may include securities other than those held by Holders. The Company shall use its best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective (subject to Section 7.2(b)), pursuant to the Act and the Rules and Regulations promulgated thereunder, until the earliest to occur of (i) the second anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) as to a particular Holder, such time as all Registrable Securities held by such Holder have been sold (A) pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement, (B) to or through a broker or dealer or underwriter in a public distribution or a public securities transaction, and/or (C) the date on which such Holder can sell all of its Registrable Securities without registration pursuant to Rule 144(k) (such period, the "Registration ------------ Period"). In the event that the Shelf Registration Statement shall cease to be - ------ effective during the Registration Period, the Company shall promptly prepare and file a new registration statement covering all Registrable Securities and shall use its best efforts to have such registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable. Any such registration statement shall be considered a "Shelf Registration Statement" hereunder. (b) Liquidated Damages. In the event that the Shelf ------------------- Registration Statement is not filed within 30 days after the Closing or declared effective by the date that is ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, the Company shall pay to each Investor liquidated damages (collectively, the "Liquidated Damages"), in cash, in an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the ------------------- total purchase price of the Purchased Shares purchased by such Investor pursuant to this Agreement (a "Liquidated Damages Payment") for each thirty day period -------------------------- (or portion thereof) thereafter, until the Shelf Registration Statement is filed or becomes effective, as the case may be; provided, however that in the case of any such period of less than thirty days the Liquidated Damages Payment shall be calculated on a pro rata basis based on the number of days actually elapsed in such period. Each Liquidated Damages Payment payable in respect of a thirty day period (or portion thereof) shall be paid at the end of such thirty day period (or portion thereof). (c) Lapse and Suspension. Subject to the provisions of this -------------------- Section 7.2(c), should the Registration Statement's effectiveness lapse for any reason while the Company has any obligation to maintain such effectiveness and the Company does not cure such lapse within 10 business days (the "Cure Period") ----------- by a post-effective amendment or a report filed 14
pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Company shall pay each investor damages at a rate of 1% per month, payable monthly, of the purchase price paid by each Investor, for the period of the lapse beyond such cure period, in cash. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, following the advice of its counsel, it is determined that: (i) it would be detrimental to the Company to effect a registration or for sales to be made from such Registration Statement, or (ii) there exists a material development that the Company would be obligated to disclose in the Registration Statement, which disclosure would be premature or inadvisable, then the Company will be permitted to suspend the use of the Registration Statement for a period of up to 45 consecutive days in any 180-day period; provided that such suspension periods shall not exceed 90 days (including any Cure Period) in the aggregate during the Registration Period (following which 90 day period the foregoing 1% damages shall begin to accrue). In the event of any suspension of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or similar event, the Investors will immediately discontinue disposition of the securities underlying the Registration Statement. In such event, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the use of the Registration Statement so suspended to be resumed as soon as possible. (d) Liquidated Damages not a Penalty. The Company and the ----------------------------------- Investor agree that, in the event that under the circumstances described above, the Shelf Registration Statement is not declared effective within ninety (90) days of the Closing, as contemplated in Section 7.2(b) or effectiveness is thereafter suspended as contemplated in Section 7.2(c), it would be impracticable or extremely difficult to fix or determine the Investor's actual damages. Therefore, the Company and the Investor each agree that the amount of the Liquidated Damages has been agreed upon as liquidated damages after negotiation as to the parties' reasonable estimate of the Investor's damages. The Company and the Investor agree that the amount of Liquidated Damages is reasonable in light of the circumstances existing at the execution of this Agreement. The Company and the Investor each acknowledge that the payment of such Liquidated Damages is not intended as a forfeiture or penalty. If the Company fails to immediately pay to the Investor any amounts due under this Section 7.2, then in addition to any amounts paid or payable pursuant to this Section, the Company shall also pay all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit or other legal action, taken to enforce or collect payment, together with interest on such payment at the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, from the date such payment was required to be paid. (e) Expenses. The registration fees and expenses incurred by -------- the Company in connection with the Shelf Registration Statement, including, without limitation, all registration, qualification and filing fees, printing expenses, escrow fees, fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company, blue sky fees and expenses, and the expense of any special audits incident to or required by any such registration, shall be borne by the Company. Each Holder shall be responsible for any fees and expenses of its counsel or other advisers. 7.3 Obligations of the Company. The Company shall furnish to the --------------------------- Holder such number of copies of a Prospectus, including a preliminary Prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the Act, and such other documents (including supplements or prospectus amendments) as the Holder may reasonably request in order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by it that are included in such registration. In 15
addition, whenever required to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities under this Agreement, the Company shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible: (a) Use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) register and qualify the securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities or Blue Sky laws of such states as shall be reasonably requested by the Holder, provided that the Company shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to service of process in any such states or jurisdictions in which it is not now so qualified or has not so consented and (ii) to keep such registration or qualification in effect for so long as the Shelf Registration Statement remains in effect, except that the Company shall not for any such purpose be required to qualify generally to do business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction where it is not so qualified, or to subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction, or to execute a general consent to service of process in effecting such registration, qualification or compliance, unless the Company is already subject to service in such jurisdiction and except as may be required by the Act or applicable rules or regulations thereunder. (b) Notify the Holder promptly (and in any event by 4:00 p.m. Mountain Time, by email, fax or other type of communication) (i) on the same day that the Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective (unless the Company receives notice of the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement after 4:00 p.m. Mountain Time, in which case the Company shall notify the Holder by 4:00 p.m. on the next business day), (ii) within one business day after any request by the Commission or any other federal or state governmental authority during the period of effectiveness of a registration statement for amendments or supplements to such registration statement or related prospectus or for additional information, (iii) on the same day of the issuance by the Commission or any other federal or state governmental authority of any stop order or similar action suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose (unless the Company receives notice of the issuance of any stop order or similar action after 4:00 p.m. Mountain Time, in which case the Company shall notify the Holder by 4:00 p.m. on the next business day), and (iv) within one business day after the receipt by the Company from the Commission or any other federal or state governmental authority of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. (c) Use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement as soon as practicable. (d) Promptly file such amendments (including post-effective amendments) and supplements to the Shelf Registration Statement and the Prospectus, file such documents as may be required to be incorporated by reference in any of such documents, and take all other actions as may be necessary to ensure to the holders of Registrable Securities the ability to effect the public resale of their Registrable Securities (including, without limitation, taking any actions necessary to ensure the availability of a Prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10(a) of the Act) continuously throughout the Registration Period; and provide or make available by posting on its website to each holder of Registrable Securities copies of any documents prepared pursuant to the foregoing promptly after such preparation. 16
7.4 Furnish Information. It shall be a condition precedent to the ------------------- obligations of the Company to take any action pursuant to Section 7.2 or Section 7.3 that the Holder shall furnish to the Company such information regarding it, the Registrable Securities held by it, and the intended method of disposition of such securities (and, when necessary, furnish updated information) as shall be required to timely effect (and maintain the effectiveness of) the registration of its Registrable Securities. 7.5 Indemnification. For the purposes of this Section 7.5, the --------------- term "registration statement" shall include any preliminary or final Prospectus, exhibit, supplement, amendment or other document included in, filed as part of, deemed to be a part of, incorporated by reference in, or otherwise relating to the Shelf Registration Statement referred to in this Section 7. (a) By the Company. To the fullest extent permitted by law, --------------- the Company will defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Investor, each Holder, the officers and directors, trustees, advisors, each person, if any, who controls any Holder and any underwriter for each (as defined in the Act) (such persons and entities collectively referred to as "Holder Indemnified Parties"), -------------------------- against any and all losses, claims, expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal and other fees and expenses), damages or liabilities (including in settlement of any claim) to which they may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, or at common law or otherwise (a "Loss"), insofar as such Losses (or actions in respect ---- thereof) arise out of any claim, action or proceeding brought by a third party arising out of or based upon any of the following (collectively, a "Violation"): --------- (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in a registration statement filed pursuant to this Section 7; (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in a registration statement filed pursuant to this Section 7 a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the Act, the Exchange Act, any federal or state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the Act, the Exchange Act or any federal or state securities law, in each case in connection with the offering covered by such registration statement; or (iv) any failure by the Company to fulfill any undertaking included in a registration statement; and, if the Company elects not to assume the defense as permitted by Section 7.5 (c), the Company will reimburse each Holder Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them, as incurred, in connection with investigating or defending or settling, compromising or paying an award granted in any proceeding relating to any such Violation; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such Loss, if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of the Company, nor shall the Company be liable in any such case 17
for any such Loss to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a Violation caused by reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration statement by a Holder Indemnified Party; and provided further, that the Company will not be liable for the reasonable legal fees and expenses of more than one counsel to all Holder Indemnified Parties unless in the reasonable opinion of counsel a conflict exists among such Holder Indemnified Parties. (b) By the Holder. To the fullest extent permitted by law, --------------- each Holder (severally and not jointly with any other Holder) will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the Shelf Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act (such persons and entities collectively referred to as "Company Indemnified Parties") against any and all --------------------------- Losses to which such Company Indemnified Parties may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state law, insofar as such Losses (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any Violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such Violation is caused by reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Holder expressly for the registration statement; and the Holder will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Company Indemnified Parties in connection with investigating or defending any such Violation; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such Loss if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of the Holder; provided further, that the Holder shall not be liable for the reasonable legal fees and expenses of more than one counsel to the Company Indemnified Parties; and provided further, that no Holder shall be required to pay amounts pursuant to this subsection (b) in excess of the net amount of proceeds received by the Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities, less the total amount paid by the Holder for such Registrable Securities. (c) Notice. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party ------ under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim for indemnification in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement of such an action and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the indemnifying party and reasonably acceptable to a majority in interest of the indemnified parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the reasonable fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party. (d) Defect Eliminated in Final Prospectus. The foregoing ----------------------------------------- indemnity agreements of the Company and the Holder are subject to the condition that, insofar as they relate to any Violation made in a preliminary prospectus but eliminated or remedied in the amended Prospectus on file with the Commission at the time the registration statement in question becomes effective or in the amended Prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to 18
Rule 424(b) of the Commission (the "Final Prospectus"), such indemnity ----------------- agreements shall not inure to the benefit of any person if a copy of the Final Prospectus was furnished in a timely manner to the indemnified party and was not furnished to the person asserting the loss, liability, claim or damage at or prior to the time such action is required by the Act. (e) Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in ------------ this Section 7.5 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above with respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Holder on the other in connection with the statements or omissions or inaccuracies in the representations or warranties of this Agreement or other matters which resulted in any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, in the case of an untrue statement, whether the untrue statement relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or a Holder on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement. The Company and the Investors agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if all Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (e). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (e) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (e), no Holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the net amount of proceeds (i.e., proceeds net of underwriting discounts, fees and commissions payable by such Holder) received by the Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities less the total amount paid by the Holder for such Registrable Securities. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7.5(e) are several and not joint. (f) Survival. The obligations of the Company and the Holder -------- under this Section shall survive the completion of any offering of Registrable Securities in a registration statement, and otherwise. 7.6 Rule 144 Reporting. With a view to making available the -------------------- benefits of certain rules and regulations of the Commission, which may at any time permit the sale of the Registrable Securities to the public without registration, the Company agrees to: (a) Make and keep adequate, current public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Act, at all times; 19
(b) File with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Exchange Act; and (c) So long as the Holder owns any Registrable Securities, to furnish to the Holder forthwith upon request a written statement by the Company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of said Rule 144, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company, and such other reports and documents of the Company as the Holder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the Commission allowing a Holder to sell any such securities without registration. 7.7 Termination of Company's Obligations. The Company shall have ------------------------------------- no obligation to register, or maintain, a registration statement governing Registrable Securities and the restrictive legend described in Section 4.8 will be removed from any certificate representing the Purchased Shares, (i) if all Registrable Securities have been registered and sold pursuant to registrations effected pursuant to this Agreement or to or through a broker or dealer or underwriter in a public distribution or public securities transaction, or (ii) with respect to any particular Holder at such time as all Registrable Securities held by such Holder may be sold pursuant to Rule 144(k), as it may be amended from time to time, including but not limited to amendments that reduce that period of time that securities must be held before such securities may be sold pursuant to such rule, as determined by counsel to the Company pursuant to a written opinion to that effect that is acceptable to the Company's transfer agent and the affected Holders. 8. ASSIGNMENT. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the ---------- registration rights of the Holder under Section 7 hereof shall be automatically assigned by such Investor to any transferee of all or any portion of such Investor's Registrable Securities who is a Permitted Transferee (as defined below); provided, however, that (a) no party may be assigned any of the foregoing rights until the Company is given written notice by the assigning party at the time of such assignment stating the name and address of the assignee and identifying the securities of the Company as to which the rights in question are being assigned; (b) that any such assignee shall receive such assigned rights subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and (c) no such assignment or assignments shall increase the obligations of the Company hereunder. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Permitted Transferee" -------------------- shall mean any person who (x) is (i) an "accredited investor" as that term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Act; (ii) a partner of such Holder, an affiliate of such Holder or a partner of an affiliate or any corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity or person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, such Holder; or (iii) any other direct transferee from such Holder of at least 25% of the Registrable Securities held by such Holder and (y) is a transferee of the Registrable Securities as permitted under the securities laws of the United States. 9. MISCELLANEOUS. ------------- 9.1 Survival of Warranties. The representations, warranties and ------------------------ covenants of the Company and the Investors contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Closing and shall in no way be affected by 20
any investigation of the subject matter thereof made by or on behalf of the Investors, their counsel or the Company, as the case may be. 9.2 Successors and Assigns. The terms and conditions of this ------------------------ Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the respective successors and assigns of the parties. 9.3 Governing Law; Venue; Waiver Of Jury Trail.

EXHIBIT 99.1 AIR METHODS - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company AIR METHODS ANNOUNCES YEAR 2003 FINANCIAL RESULTS AND YEAR 2004 OUTLOOK Fourth Quarter Net Income Per Basic Share of $0.16 Reflects 33% Increase Company Targets Greater than 20% Growth in 2004 EPS DENVER, CO., March 11, 2004 -- Air Methods Corporation (NASDAQ: AIRM), the largest air medical transportation company in the world, reported revenue and net income for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2003. For the year, revenue increased 86% to $242.5 million compared to $130.7 million in the prior year. Net income decreased slightly to $5.1 million or $0.53 per basic share ($0.51 per diluted share) compared to $5.2 million or $0.56 per basic share ($0.54 per diluted share). The current year results reflect a full year of operations of Rocky Mountain Holdings, LLC (RMH), while the prior year included only two and a half months of combined operations. As previously disclosed, the decrease in net income was primarily attributed to a significant increase in missed transports due to weather. For the quarter, revenue increased to $65.7 million as compared with $47.7 million during the prior year period, a 38% increase. This increase was primarily attributed to revenues generated from new base expansion within the community-based operations, as well as having a full quarter of activity in 2003 from the RMH acquisition, which closed on October 16, 2002. Patients transported within the community-based operations increased by over 50% to 7,085 from 4,709 in the prior year quarter. The Company generated fourth quarter net income of $1.6 million or $0.16 per basic share ($0.15 per diluted share) as compared to prior-year quarterly net income of $1.1 million or $0.12 per basic share ($0.11 per diluted share). This reflects a 47% increase in net income and a 33% increase in net income per basic share as compared with the prior-year quarter. Aaron Todd, CEO of Air Methods, commented, "With the cessation of severe weather patterns, we are pleased to have achieved earnings per basic share of $0.45 during the second half of 2003. The consolidation and integration of RMH operations and continued organic expansion within all three of our operating divisions were keys to this accomplishment. I am deeply appreciative of the efforts of our team in addressing the challenges of consolidating the RMH operation, which was nearly equal our size, while at the same time continuing to grow the core businesses." The increase in net income for the quarter was primarily attributed to a $972,000 increase in segment net income (excluding internal sales) within the Products Division. In addition, quarterly net income was favorably impacted by an increase of more than 14% in patients transported from community bases, including RMH bases, which were in operation for over one year (Same Base Transports). Bad debt expense as a percentage of community-based revenue was 25.5% for the current-year quarter as compared with 18.4% in the prior-year quarter and 24.2% in the third quarter of 2003. The quarterly earnings were also impacted by maintenance expense which exceeded budget expectations by over $1.2 million.
The Company also announced that it has established a goal to increase basic earnings per share for 2004 by 20% or more. This goal is based, in part, on projected increases in flight volume due to the severity of weather patterns experienced during the first half of 2003, and on expected increased contributions from new base expansion within the community-based operations. The Company noted, however, that this outlook is contingent on stable collection rates for patients transported within its community-based operations and more favorable weather patterns than occurred during the first half of 2003. While Same Base Transports during January and February 2004 increased by over 17% due to more temperate weather patterns, collections were lower than expected during the same period. Mr. Todd continued, "I am optimistic that we can continue this growth trend in both top line and bottom line in 2004. While fluctuations within our collection rates are inherent within our operations and are affected by external economic factors, we believe recent and projected strength in patient transport volume and improved contributions from prior year expansion activities should offset the recent softness in collection rates." The Company will discuss these results and its outlook for 2004 in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern. Interested parties can access the call by dialing (888) 396-5640 or (706) 643-0580 (international) or by accessing the web cast at www.airmethods.com.

EXHIBIT 99.1 [GRAPHIC OMITED] AIR METHODS - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company AIR METHODS REPORTS 1Q2004 RESULTS Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.74 Includes Cumulative Effect of $0.79 for Change in Accounting Principle Results before Effect of Change in Accounting Principle In Line with Previously Announced Expectations DENVER, CO., May 12, 2004 -- Air Methods Corporation (NASDAQ: AIRM) reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2004. Revenue increased 14% to $61.6 million from $54.0 million in the year-ago period. The Company reported net income of $8.1 million or $0.74 per basic and diluted share as compared with prior year period net loss of $0.5 million or $(0.05) per basic and diluted share. The current quarter results include an increase to net income of $8.6 million or $0.79 per basic and diluted share from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax effect. Loss before cumulative effect of change was $0.5 million or $(0.05) per basic and diluted share, in line with expectations announced in April. The cumulative effect stated above relates to the Company's decision to change its method of accounting for major engine and airframe component overhaul costs from the accrual method to the direct expense method, effective January 1, 2004. Under the direct expense method, maintenance costs are recognized as expense as maintenance services are performed. The Company believes the new method is preferable in the circumstances because the maintenance liability is not recorded until there is an obligating event and because this method is the predominant method used in the transportation industry. The new method also eliminates significant estimates and judgments inherent in the accrual method. Pro forma results, assuming the change in accounting principle had been applied retroactively, would reflect net income of $0.8 million and basic and diluted income per share of $0.08 for the quarter ended March 31, 2003. Trent Carman, Chief Financial Officer, stated, "As previously disclosed, our first quarter results were adversely affected by a decrease in net revenue after bad debt expense per community-based transport as compared with the prior year first quarter. This decrease was offset, in part, by a 16% increase in patients transported from community bases which were in operation for over one year as compared with the prior year period. While net revenue after bad debt expense per community-based transport was down 8.8% compared with the prior year first quarter, the decrease, as compared with the fourth quarter of 2003, was 3.0%." Compared to the year-ago quarter, community-based operations revenue increased 24% to $39.0 million, while current period divisional net loss of $228,000 compares with divisional net income of $523,000 in the prior year period. Hospital-based operations revenue decreased 2.2% to $20.6 million, while divisional net income decreased 86% to $135,000 from $939,000. The decrease in revenue is attributed to two hospital contracts that did not renew at expiration in late 2003 and early 2004 and to a hospital customer that converted to the Air Methods' community-based model in late 2003. The decrease in hospital-based divisional earnings was primarily attributed to higher than anticipated maintenance expense of $659,000. External revenue for the Products Division increased 52% from $1.3 million to $2.0 million in the current year quarter, while divisional net income from external projects increased from $112,000 to $1,255,000. Increases in both external revenue and net income for the division were attributed to a three-fold increase in backlog beginning in 2004 as compared with 2003, and to increased margins due to changes in product line mix during the quarter.
Aaron Todd, CEO, noted, "While we are obviously disappointed that reimbursement continued to show weakness during our first quarter, we are pleased that this weakness has been offset by higher flight volumes and strength within our Products Division. Flight volume has continued to be robust through the date of this release. In addition, reimbursement rates began to decline during the second quarter of 2003; accordingly, the quarterly comparisons should improve on a relative basis throughout the remainder of 2004 if reimbursement rates stabilize. As a result, we continue to believe that our objective to grow basic earnings per share by 20% is still achievable. This expectation, however, is subject to the continuation of growth in flight volume and stabilized reimbursement rates at current levels." The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern.

ITEM 4. CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT On May 12, 2004, the Air Methods Corporation 401(k) Plan (the Plan) dismissed its independent auditor, KPMG LLP (KPMG) for the year ending December 31, 2003. This action was approved by the Audit Committee of Air Methods Corporation. The audit reports of KPMG on the financial statements of the Plan for fiscal years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. In addition, during the Plan's fiscal years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, and through May 12, 2004, there was no disagreement with KPMG on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreement, if not resolved to the satisfaction of KPMG, would have caused KPMG to make reference to the subject of that disagreement in its reports on the Plan's financial statements for those fiscal periods. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, and through May 12, 2004, there were no "reportable events" as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. The Plan provided a copy of the foregoing disclosures to KPMG prior to the date of the filing of this report and requested that KPMG furnish it with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not it agrees with the statements in this Item 4. A copy of the letter furnished by KPMG in response to that request (as required by Item 304(a)(3) of Regulation S-K) dated June 28, 2004, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K. Grant Thornton LLP (Grant Thornton) was engaged as the Plan's new independent accountants on June 9, 2004. During the two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the interim period preceding the engagement of Grant Thornton, the Plan has not consulted with Grant Thornton regarding either: (a) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Plan's financial statements, and neither a written report or oral advice was provided to the Plan by Grant Thornton that Grant Thornton concluded was an important factor considered by the Plan in reaching a decision as to an accounting, auditing, or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a "disagreement" or "reportable event," as those terms are used in Item 304(a)(1) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of Regulation S-K.

EXHIBIT 99.1 [GRAPHIC OMITTED] AIR METHODS - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company AIR METHODS REPORTS 2Q2004 RESULTS Revenue Increases 29% for the Quarter; Diluted Earnings per Share of $0.22 DENVER, CO., August 12, 2004 -- Air Methods Corporation (NASDAQ: AIRM) reported results for the quarter ended June 30, 2004. Revenue increased 29% to $74.3 million from $57.5 million in the year-ago quarter. For the six-month period, revenue increased 24% to $135.9 million, up from $109.8 million in the prior-year six-month period. Net income increased 93% to $2.5 million or $0.23 per basic and $0.22 per diluted share as compared with prior-year quarter net income of $1.3 million or $0.14 per basic and $0.13 per diluted share. Net income for the six-month period was $10.6 million ($0.97 per basic and $0.94 per diluted share) compared to $0.8 million ($0.08 per basic and diluted share) for the prior-year six-month period. The current six-month period results include a first quarter increase to net income of $8.6 million or $0.79 per basic and $0.76 per diluted share from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax effect. Income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was $2.0 million or $0.18 per basic and diluted share for the six-month period. The cumulative effect stated above relates to the Company's decision to change its method of accounting for major engine and airframe component overhaul costs from the accrual method to the direct expense method, effective January 1, 2004. Under the direct expense method, maintenance costs are recognized as expense as maintenance services are performed. Pro forma results, assuming the change in accounting principle had been applied retroactively, would reflect net income of $2.6 million and basic and diluted income per share of $0.28 and $0.27, respectively, for the quarter ended June 30, 2003. Pro forma results for the six-month period ended June 30, 2003 would reflect net income of $3.5 million ($0.36 per basic and $0.35 per diluted share). SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Community-Based Operations: Revenue from community-based operations increased 51% to $50.8 million, and segment net income increased 65% to $4.4 million during the second quarter, as compared with the prior-year quarter. These increases were primarily the result of the addition of 15 new bases during or subsequent to the second quarter of 2003 and an 11% increase over the prior-year period in transports for bases in operation greater than one year (Same-Base Transports). Net revenue after bad debt expense per transport for the current year second quarter was $4,414, as compared with $4,445 in the prior-year quarter and $4,189 in the first quarter of 2004. Hospital-Based Operations: Revenue from hospital-based operations decreased by 0.1% to $22.1 million and segment net income decreased 26% to $1.2 million during the second quarter as compared with the prior-year quarter. The slight decrease in revenue was attributed to the discontinuance of service under three contracts and the conversion of another contract to the community-based operating model prior to the second quarter of 2004, offset by a 6.9% increase in flight volume, annual price increases, and the addition of one new hospital contract. The decrease in divisional earnings was attributed to unfavorable budget variances in maintenance expense that exceeded $800,000 during the current quarter due, in part, to higher than anticipated engine overhaul expenditures. Maintenance expense as a percentage of divisional revenue increased to 31.4% from 26.5% as compared with the prior-year quarter.
Products Division: Revenue, including revenue generated from internal projects, increased 23% to $3.1 million, while segment net income increased $578,000 to $800,000 during the second quarter as compared with the prior-year quarter. The increase in earnings was attributed to higher margins from changes in product mix and from a decrease in fixed production costs as a percentage of revenue. Aaron Todd, Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are very pleased with our second quarter results. Flight volumes within both services divisions experienced healthy growth over the prior-year quarter due to more moderate weather patterns and elevated marketing efforts. Although net revenue after bad debt expense per community-based transport was largely unchanged from the prior-year quarter, the Company did experience a 5.4% improvement in this measure over the first quarter of 2004. While aggregate maintenance expenses for both divisions were $1.6 million higher than anticipated for the current quarter, the Company was still able to achieve healthy growth in net income. I am also pleased to report that our first quarter efforts to enhance our collection capabilities have helped reduce our debt, net of cash, by over $11 million during the second quarter." "July Same-Base Transports were 2.3% lower than July 2003 primarily due to higher weather-related flight cancellations, but total community-based transports for the month still exceeded June 2004 results by 1.7%. With the strength of our second quarter results, the Company is presently on track to achieve its objective to grow basic earnings per share by 20% or greater in 2004," said Todd. The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern.

EXHIBIT 99.1 [GRAPHIC OMMITED] Air Methods - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company Air Methods Updates Third Quarter Outlook FIRST TWO MONTHS IMPACTED BY HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED MAINTENANCE EXPENSES, BAD DEBT RESERVE INCREASES AND LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED FLIGHT VOLUME DENVER, CO, September 23, 2004 -- Air Methods Corporation (NASDAQ: AIRM), the world's largest air medical transportation company, provided an update of the financial results for its third quarter ending September 30, 2004. The Company announced that its third quarter results through August were impacted by a $1.3 million increase in bad debt reserves primarily associated with changes in its historical collection rates and payer mix estimates. On a positive note, days' sales outstanding have decreased from 133 days as of March 31, 2004 to 110 days as of August 31, 2004. Bad debt reserve rates applied to current period transports have increased only slightly as compared to June 2004 transports. The quarter-to-date period also reflects a 17.9% increase in maintenance expenses as compared with the prior year two-month period, despite only a 3.1% increase in flight volume. The percentage increase not attributed to flight volume reflects an increase of approximately $1,100,000 over the prior-year period. The increase in expense was primarily attributed to significant engine and transmission overhaul activity during the period, combined with annual inflationary adjustments in parts and overhaul costs. Additionally, community-based transports during the month of August were 229 below budget expectations. For community bases in operation greater than one year, 360 fewer requests for service were received as compared with the prior-year month, partially attributed to unfavorable weather patterns in the Eastern States. Community-based operating bases in service greater than one year in the Northeast and Southeast regions averaged almost 10 fewer requests for service per base during August than in the prior-year period. The aggregate unfavorable budget variance attributed to the lower flight volume was approximately $1,000,000 based on average net revenue after bad debt expense per transport recorded during the period. Although the Company has remained profitable during July and August, management anticipates the financial results for the quarter to be significantly below budgeted expectations. In light of these developments, management believes that it is highly improbable that the Company will achieve growth in its basic earnings per share for 2004. Aaron Todd, CEO of Air Methods, stated, "We are certainly disappointed with these recent developments. While fluctuations in maintenance expenses, bad debt expense, and flight volume are inherent within our business, it is unusual to have all three variables impact us negatively at the same time." "With the significant reduction in days' sales outstanding and relatively unchanged collection rates subsequent to June 30, 2004, we are hopeful that future adjustments will be less significant. We are also encouraged that community-based flight volumes for the first half of September have returned to
budgeted expectations. Effective September 1, 2004, the Company has also adjusted its pricing structure to facilitate stronger reimbursement per transport. While these changes will not fully offset the factors discussed above, they should position the Company for better results moving forward," said Todd.

EXHIBIT 99.1 AIR METHODS - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company AIR METHODS ANNOUNCES 3RD QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS Decrease in EPS Reflects Impact of Previously Reported Events DENVER, CO, November 11, 2004 -- Air Methods Corporation (NASDAQ: AIRM) reported financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2004. For the quarter, revenue increased 2.9% to $68.9 million compared to $67.0 million in the prior-year period. Net income decreased 46.1% to $1.5 million, or $0.13 per basic and diluted share, compared to prior-year net income of $2.7 million, or $0.28 per basic and $0.27 per diluted share. For the nine months, revenue increased 15.9% to $204.8 million compared to $176.7 million for the prior-year period. Net income was $12.0 million, or $1.11 per basic and $1.06 per diluted share, compared to prior-year net income of $3.5 million, or $0.36 per basic and $0.35 per diluted share. The current nine-month period results include a first quarter increase to net income of $8.6 million or $0.79 per basic and $0.76 per diluted share, from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax effect. Income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was $3.4 million or $0.32 per basic and $0.30 per diluted share. The cumulative effect stated above relates to the Company's decision to change its method of accounting for major engine and airframe component overhaul costs from the accrual method to the direct expense method effective January 1, 2004. Under the direct expense method, maintenance costs are recognized as expense as maintenance services are performed. Pro forma results, assuming the change in accounting principle had been applied retroactively, would reflect net income of $3.3 million or $0.35 per basic and $0.34 per diluted share for the quarter ended September 30, 2003. Pro forma results for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2003 would reflect net income of $6.8 million, or $0.71 per basic and $0.68 per diluted share. As disclosed on September 23, 2004, the current year third quarter was impacted by higher than anticipated maintenance expenses, bad debt reserve increases and lower than anticipated flight volume during the first two months of the quarter. The aggregate effect of these factors reduced income before income taxes by over $3.3 million through August. For the nine-month period, net cash provided by operating activities increased significantly from $0.2 million in 2003 to $13.2 million for the same period in 2004. This is partially attributed to a reduction in days' sales outstanding in accounts receivable from 115 days as of the beginning of 2004 to 109 days as of the end of September. Days' sales outstanding had reached a high of 133 days as of March 31, 2004. The increase in cash provided by operating activities has also resulted in a decrease in long-term indebtedness, net of cash, from $80.4 million as of December 31, 2003 to $73.8 million as of the end of September. THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS: - - Community-Based Operations: Community-based services revenue increased 3.7% to $43.5 million from $42.0 million, while segment net income decreased 31.4% to $2.7 million from $3.9 million in the prior-year quarter. Total patient transports for the quarter were 8,018 as compared with 7,142 in the prior-year quarter. Revenue did not increase in proportion to increases in patient activity due to higher contractual discount allowances which reduced net revenue, with corresponding reductions in bad debt expense. Net revenue after bad debt expense per patient transport decreased from $4,454 per transport in the prior-year quarter to $4,339 during the current-year quarter, due to lower than anticipated collection rates. For bases in operation greater than one year, patient transports (Same-Base Transports) increased by less than 1% or 55 transports. Requests for transport for bases in operation greater than one year decreased 3.6% from the prior year period, partially attributed to hurricanes and tropical storms which affected the southeast and mid-Atlantic operations.
- - Hospital-Based Operations: Revenue from hospital-based operations increased by 1.8% to $23.5 million from $23.1 million, while segment net income decreased by 61.2% to $0.9 million from $2.3 million. The decrease in segment net income was almost entirely attributed to higher maintenance expenses. Maintenance expense increased 26.9% to $8.2 million from $6.4 million, despite a 1.1% decrease in medical flights. - - Products Division: The Products Division external revenue increased 15.9% to $2.0 million from $1.7 million, while segment net income (excluding internal sales) increased 116.2% to $1.2 million from $0.5 million for the prior-year period. The Company also announced that Same Base Transports for October were down 318 transports or 13.3%, primarily as a result of missed transports due to weather cancellations which were up 343 transports or 86.0%. The Company noted that October 2003 weather patterns were more benign than average, while October 2004 weather patterns were more severe, especially in the mid-west region. Aaron Todd, CEO of Air Methods, noted, "As we stated in our earlier press release, fluctuations in maintenance expenses, reserves for uncollectible accounts, and flight volume are inherent within our business model. However, it is unusual for all three variables to impact us negatively at the same time. Despite the weaker flight volumes in October, we remain optimistic that these variables will normalize over the coming months and quarters. Changes in pricing structure effective September 1, 2004, combined with positive benefits from having reduced our days' sales outstanding significantly, should improve our reimbursement for current and future transports. In addition, we continue to pursue numerous opportunities to expand our operations within both service delivery models to further enhance our economies of scale. Having reduced our net indebtedness significantly in 2004 to-date, our stronger balance sheet will help ensure we have the capital resources to take advantage of these opportunities." The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern.

EXHIBIT 99.1 [GRAPHIC OMITED] AIR METHODS - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [GRAPHIC OMITED] The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company AIR METHODS ANNOUNCES YEAR 2004 FINANCIAL RESULTS AND PROVIDES FIRST QUARTER 2005 UPDATE DENVER, CO., March 16, 2005 -- Air Methods Corporation (NASDAQ: AIRM), the largest air medical transportation company in the world, reported revenue and net results for the year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2004. For the year, revenue increased 13% to $273.1 million compared to $242.5 million in the prior year. Net income was $11.8 million or $1.09 per basic share ($1.05 per diluted share) compared to $5.1 million or $0.53 per basic share ($0.51 per diluted share). The current year results include a first quarter increase to net income of $8.6 million or $0.79 per basic ($0.76 per diluted share), from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax effect. Income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was $3.2 million or $0.30 per basic ($0.29 per diluted share) for the year. For the fourth quarter, revenue increased to $68.3 million as compared with $65.7 million during the prior year period, a 4% increase, while net income decreased from $1.6 million or $0.16 per basic share ($0.15 per diluted share) in the prior year quarter to a net loss of $0.2 million or $0.02 per basic and diluted share in the current year quarter. The cumulative effect stated above relates to the Company's decision to change its method of accounting for major engine and airframe component overhaul costs from the accrual method to the direct expense method effective January 1, 2004. Under the direct expense method, maintenance costs are recognized as expense as maintenance services are performed. Pro forma results, assuming the change in accounting principle had been applied retroactively, would reflect net income of $8.7 million or $0.90 per basic and $0.86 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2003. Pro forma results for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 would reflect net income of $1.9 million, or $0.19 per basic and $0.18 per diluted share. The $1.8 million decrease in fourth quarter earnings was primarily attributed to a significant decrease in patients transported for community bases in operation greater than one year (same-base transports), mostly due to higher weather cancellations. Same-base transports decreased 481 or 7% over the prior-year quarter. Of this decrease in transports, 304 or 63% were due to specific requests for transports that were missed due to weather conditions. The fourth quarter results also reflect $0.8 million in third-party expenses associated with Sarbanes-Oxley regulatory requirements and $0.2 million from losses associated with disposition of aircraft. During the 2004 fourth quarter, total patients transported within community-based operations were 7,143 as compared with 7,098 during the prior year quarter. Net revenue after bad debt per community-based transport increased 12% from $4,418 to $4,967, while day's sales outstanding in net receivables for consolidated operations decreased from 109 days as of September 30, 2004 to 104 days as of year-end. Consolidated maintenance expense per transport increased by less than 1% during the quarter, as compared with the prior-year period. The Company also provided an update on first quarter 2005 events. While flight volume throughout the first half of March has been very strong, weather did have a significant impact on flight volume through February. Same-base transports within the community-based operations through February were down 618 or 14% as compared with the prior-year period. Of this amount, 452 or 73% were attributed to increases in weather cancellations. In addition, retentions for workers' compensation premiums associated with the January accidents were $0.8 million, of which $0.6 million will be expensed during the first quarter. The impact of reduced flight volumes and higher premium costs are expected to be partially offset by improved net revenue after bad debt per community-based transport and by a moderate price increase effective March 1st.
The Company announced that it has received verbal commitment to refinance its subordinated notes totaling $23 million with lower cost, variable interest rate, senior-secured financing with commercial banks with whom the Company has an existing relationship. While prepayment penalties and previously capitalized loan origination costs in the amount of approximately $3.4 million will be expensed upon closing, annual interest savings at current interest rates are expected to be approximately $1.9 million. The Company expects to close the transaction during the next 30 days. Aaron Todd, CEO of Air Methods, commented, "Although the 2004/2005 winter has proven more severe than the prior year, we continue to be very optimistic for 2005. Our efforts to improve the timeliness and effectiveness of our collection efforts, combined with needed price adjustments, have resulted in significantly improved net revenue after bad debt per transport within our community-based operations. With more moderate weather patterns and with the benefit of reduced interest rates for a significant percentage of our debt load, we believe we are well-positioned to produce improved earnings moving forward into 2005 and subsequent years." The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern.

EXHIBIT 99.1 [GRAPHIC OMITTED] Air Methods - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company AIR METHODS REPORTS 1Q2005 RESULTS AND 2Q2005 UPDATE Company Also Announces Completion of its Refinancing of $23M in Subordinated Indebtedness DENVER, CO., May 10, 2005 -- Air Methods Corporation (NASDAQ: AIRM) reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 and provided an update of second quarter 2005 events. Revenue increased 11.2% to $68.5 million from $61.6 million in the year-ago quarter. The Company reported a net loss of $(0.5) million or $(0.04) per basic and diluted share as compared with prior-year period net income of $8.1 million or $0.74 per basic and diluted share. The prior-year quarter results include an increase to net income of $8.6 million or $0.79 per basic and diluted share from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax effect. Loss before cumulative effect of change was $(0.5) million or $(0.05) per basic and diluted share. As previously disclosed, the first quarter results were adversely impacted from increases in weather- induced flight cancellations, primarily during the months of January and February. Although March flight volume rapidly improved to a more normalized pattern, it was insufficient to offset the adverse impact of January and February. For the quarter, patients transported for community bases in operation greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) decreased by 638 flights or 9.3%. Of this amount, 497 were directly attributed to an increase in missed flights due to weather cancellations as compared with the prior-year quarter. The first quarter results also include approximately $0.6 million (pre-tax) in workers compensation premium expenses for the self-insured portion of claims relating to accidents which occurred in January. Third-party expenses incurred during the first quarter of 2005 related to the 2004 audit of internal controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act exceeded $0.3 million (pre-tax). The lower flight volume and increased premium and regulatory compliance expenses were more than offset by higher net revenue after bad debt expense per community-based transport. Net revenue after bad debt per community-based transport increased from $4,189 to $5,118, a 22.2% increase. This improvement was attributed to price increases, improved payer mix, and more timely billing and collection efforts. Days' sales outstanding for community-based operations decreased from 148 days at March 31, 2004 to 105 days at March 31, 2005. Compared to the year-ago quarter, community-based operations revenue increased 14.3% to $44.6 million, while current period divisional net income of $0.5 million compares with divisional net loss of $(0.2) million in the prior-year period. Hospital-based operations revenue increased 8.8% to $22.4 million, while divisional net income increased to $0.6 million from $0.1 million in the prior-year quarter. External revenue for the Products Division decreased 24.7% from $2.0 million to $1.5 million in the current year quarter, while divisional net income from external projects decreased from $1.3 million to $0.4 million. Effective yesterday, the Company completed the refinancing of its subordinated notes totaling $23 million with lower cost, variable interest rate, senior-secured financing with commercial banks with whom the Company has existing relationships. The second quarter results will include the write off of approximately $1.8 million in debt origination costs and note discount related to the subordinated debt, as well as a $1.4 million prepayment penalty. For the first quarter of 2005, the effective interest rate on the subordinated debt, including amortization of debt origination costs and note discount, was 16.2%. The current blended interest rate on the newly financed senior-secured financing, including amortization of origination costs, is 6.8%. The Company disclosed that weather, which began to improve in March, continued to be moderate in April. Total community-based transports of 2,704 during the month of April, compare favorably with an average of 2,246 per month during the first quarter of 2005 and 2,634 during the month of March. Same-Base Transports during the month of April decreased by 60 transports or 2.3% as compared with the prior-year month. Weather cancellations for community bases in operation greater than one year increased by 79 transports as compared with the prior-year month.
Aaron Todd, CEO, stated, "We are pleased to have generated improvement in operating results, despite the very severe weather experienced during the months of January and February. Reimbursement rates for community-based operations during the first quarter have exceeded expectations, while maintenance expenses were in line with budgeted expectations. Should weather continue to be moderate and reimbursement rates remain near current levels, our outlook for strong growth in earnings for 2005 is a very reasonable expectation. Our outlook is further justified with the expected decrease in interest expense associated with our debt refinancing, excluding the effect of write-offs of origination costs, note discount, and prepayment penalties. We are also excited about pending and anticipated new contracts within the Products Division that we hope to announce soon." The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern. Interested parties can access the call by dialing (888) 396-5640 (domestic) or (706) 643-0580 (international) or by accessing the web cast at www.airmethods.com.

ITEM 1.02. TERMINATION OF MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT On May 9, 2005, Air Methods Corporation (the "Company") prepaid $23,000,000 of outstanding subordinated indebtedness with Prudential Capital Partners, L.P. and Prudential Capital Partners Management Fund, L.P. The funds used to prepay the subordinated indebtedness were obtained from an amended and restated senior credit facility (see further description below). In conjunction with the prepayment of the subordinated indebtedness, the Company was required to pay a 6% prepayment penalty. See also Item 2.03 for a description of the amended and restated credit facility and a related security agreement. ITEM 2.03. CREATION OF DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION On May 9, 2005, the Company amended and restated its senior revolving credit facility (the "Amended Credit Facility") with PNC Bank, National Association ("PNC") to provide for, among other things, up to $35 million of revolving advances (the "Revolver"), $12 million under one term loan ("Term Loan A") and $8 million under another term loan ("Term Loan B"). A copy of the Amended and Restated Credit Facility and Amended and Restated Security Agreement are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to this Form 8-K and incorporated by reference. The proceeds from Term Loans A and B, along with additional borrowings under the Revolver, were used to prepay $23 million (plus accrued interest and the prepayment penalty mentioned above) of outstanding subordinated indebtedness on May 9, 2005. Borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility are secured by 13 aircraft and substantially all of the Company's accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and general intangibles. The maturity date of Amended Credit Facility is March 31, 2010. The Amended Credit Facility can be prepaid prior to maturity, subject to a prepayment fee which ranges from .25% to 1.00%. The Company and each of its three subsidiaries are each direct obligors on the Amended Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Revolver and Term Loan A bear interest, at the Company's option, at either (i) the higher of the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or the prime rate as announced by the lenders plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.50% or (ii) a rate equal to LIBOR (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.75% to 3.25%. The applicable margin in each case is based upon the ratio of Senior Debt (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) to EBITDA (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters. Borrowings under Term Loan B bear interest at the Company's option, at either (i) the higher of the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or the prime rate as announced by the lenders plus 1.50% or (ii) a rate equal to LIBOR plus 3.75%. Quarterly principal payments of $500,000 commence on April 1, 2006 for Term Loan A, with the remaining principal balance due March 31, 2010. Quarterly principal payments of $1,000,000 commence on April 1, 2006 for Term Loan B. The maximum amount of borrowings under the Revolver is equal to the lessor of (i) $35,000,000 or (ii) the sum of (a) 75% of eligible Medicare, Medicaid, insurance company and community based payors, (b) 85% of all other eligible receivables, and (c) the least of (A) 60% of eligible inventory, (B) 85% of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory, or (C) $15,000,000. Each aircraft securing the Amended Credit Facility has a designated Aircraft Collateral Value (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility). Each of the aircraft may be released as Collateral (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) provided that the Company provides a replacement aircraft that is unencumbered and has an appraised value equal to, or greater than, 118% of the Aircraft Collateral Value of the aircraft being released. To the extent that 118% of appraised value of the replacement aircraft is less than the Aircraft Collateral Value of the aircraft to be released, the Company will be required to repay the amount of the difference. The Company may sell or dispose of aircraft without providing substitute collateral if it repays the amount of the Aircraft Collateral Value in order to release the aircraft as Collateral. If repayments are made by the Company in connection with such sale of Collateral, the repayments will first 1
be applied to the outstanding principal installments of Term Loan B in inverse order of maturities, with any remaining funds applied against the outstanding principal installments of Term Loan A in inverse order of maturities Commencing with the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2006, the Company will be required to make principal prepayments equal to 50% of the amount of Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility). These prepayments will first be applied to the outstanding principal installments of Term Loan B in inverse order of maturities thereof, with any remaining funds applied against the outstanding principal payments of Term Loan A in inverse order of maturities thereof. The Amended Credit Facility contains various covenants that limit, among other things, the Company's ability to: - create liens; - declare dividends; - make loans and investments; - enter into real property leases exceeding specified limits; - make any material change to the nature of the Company's business; - enter into any transaction with affiliates other than on arms' length terms; - prepay indebtedness, except in connection with refinancing Aircraft Indebtedness (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility); - enter into a merger or consolidation; or - sell assets outside of the ordinary course of business. The Amended Credit Agreement also contains covenants that require the Company to maintain: - a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) of not less than 1.20 to 1.00; - a minimum net worth; - a Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) of not more than 4.00 to 1.00 (decreasing after 6/30/05). The Amended Credit Facility limits the amount of indebtedness that can be incurred, the net present value of operating leases entered into and unfinanced capital expenditures to $35 million per year (increasing in 2006).

Agent shall give Borrowing Agent five (5) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to decrease the Advance Rates. The rights of Agent under this subsection are subject to the provisions of Section 16.2(b). 2.2. Procedure for Revolving Advances Borrowing. ------------------------------------------ (a) Borrowing Agent on behalf of any Borrower may notify Agent prior to 1:00 p.m. on a Business Day of a Borrower's request to incur, on that day or a designated subsequent day, a Revolving Advance hereunder that is a Domestic Rate Loan specifying (i) the date of the proposed borrowing (which shall be a Business Day) and (ii) the amount to be borrowed. Should any amount required to be paid as interest hereunder, or as fees or other charges under this Agreement or any other agreement with Agent or Lenders, or with respect to any other Obligation, become due, same shall be deemed a request for a Revolving Advance as of the date such payment is due, in the amount required to pay in full such interest, fee, charge or Obligation under this Agreement or any other agreement with Agent or Lenders, and such request shall be irrevocable. (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) above, in the event any Borrower desires to obtain a Eurodollar Rate Loan, Borrowing Agent shall give Agent written notice by no later than 1:00 p.m. on a day which is at least three (3) Business Days prior to the 26
date such Eurodollar Rate Loan is to be borrowed, specifying (i) the date of the proposed borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), (ii) the type of borrowing and the amount on the date of such Advance to be borrowed, which amount shall be in a minimum amount of $1,000,000 and in integral multiples of $500,000 in addition thereto, and (iii) the duration of the first Interest Period therefor. Interest Periods for Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be for one, two, three or six months; provided, if an Interest Period would end on a day that is not a Business Day, it shall end on the next succeeding Business Day unless such day falls in the next succeeding calendar month in which case the Interest Period shall end on the next preceding Business Day. No Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be made available to any Borrower during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default. After giving effect to each requested Eurodollar Rate Loan, including those which are converted from a Domestic Rate Loan under Section 2.2(d), there shall not be outstanding more than six (6) Eurodollar Rate Loans, in the aggregate. (c) Each Interest Period of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall commence on the date such Eurodollar Rate Loan is made and shall end on such date as Borrowing Agent may elect as set forth in subsection (b)(iii) above provided that the exact length of each Interest Period shall be determined in accordance with the practice of the interbank market for offshore Dollar deposits and no Interest Period shall end after the last day of the Term. In respect of the Term Loans, Borrowing Agent shall elect the amount to be borrowed as Domestic Rate Loans and Eurodollar Rate Loans, and shall specify the initial Interest Period applicable to a Eurodollar Rate Loan by its notice of borrowing given to Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or by its notice of conversion given to Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(d), as the case may be. Borrowing Agent shall elect the duration of each succeeding Interest Period for Eurodollar Rate Loans by giving irrevocable written notice to Agent of such duration not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day which is at least three (3) Business Days prior to the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loan. If Agent does not receive timely notice of the Interest Period elected by Borrowing Agent, Borrowing Agent shall be deemed to have elected to convert to a Domestic Rate Loan subject to Section 2.2(d) herein below. Elections in effect as of the Closing Date made under the Original Loan Agreement in respect of Revolving Advances shall remain in effect without regard to the closing of the Transactions unless and until converted in accordance with Section 2.2(d), and no Interest Period shall be terminated solely by reason of the Closing Date. (d) Provided that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Borrowing Agent may, on the last Business Day of the then current Interest Period applicable to any outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loan, or on any Business Day with respect to Domestic Rate Loans, convert any such loan into a loan of another type in the same aggregate principal amount provided that any conversion of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be made only on the last Business Day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loan. If Borrowing Agent desires to convert a loan, Borrowing Agent shall give Agent written notice by no later than 1:00 p.m. (i) on the day which is at least three (3) Business Days' prior to the date on which such conversion is to occur with respect to a conversion from a Domestic Rate Loan to a Eurodollar Rate Loan, or (ii) on a day which is at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date on which such conversion is to occur with respect to a conversion from a Eurodollar Rate Loan to a 27
Domestic Rate Loan, specifying, in each case, the date of such conversion, the loans to be converted and if the conversion is from a Domestic Rate Loan to any other type of loan, the duration of the first Interest Period therefor. (e) At its option and upon written notice given prior to 1:00 p.m. at least three (3) Business Days' prior to the date of such prepayment, any Borrower may prepay the Eurodollar Rate Loans in whole at any time or in part from time to time, without premium or penalty, with accrued interest on the principal being prepaid to the date of such repayment. Such Borrower shall specify the date of prepayment of Advances which are Eurodollar Rate Loans and the amount of such prepayment. In the event that any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan is required or permitted on a date other than the last Business Day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, such Borrower shall indemnify Agent and Lenders therefor in accordance with Section 2.2(f) hereof. (f) Each Borrower shall indemnify Agent and Lenders and hold Agent and Lenders harmless from and against any and all losses or expenses that Agent and Lenders may sustain or incur as a consequence of any prepayment, conversion of or any default by any Borrower in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Eurodollar Rate Loan or failure by any Borrower to complete a borrowing of, a prepayment of or conversion of or to a Eurodollar Rate Loan after notice thereof has been given, including, but not limited to, any interest payable by Agent or Lenders to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make or maintain its Eurodollar Rate Loans hereunder. For purposes of this Section, it shall be assumed that Agent or Lenders had obtained funds from such lenders of funds in order to make or maintain its Eurodollar Rate Loans hereunder, for a corresponding amount and term. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted by Agent or any Lender to Borrowing Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (g) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if any Applicable Law, treaty, regulation or directive, or any change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof, shall make it unlawful for any Lender (for purposes of this subsection (g), the term "Lender" shall include any Lender and the office or branch where any Lender or any corporation or bank controlling such Lender makes or maintains any Eurodollar Rate Loans) to make or maintain its Eurodollar Rate Loans, the obligation of Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate Loans hereunder shall forthwith be cancelled and Borrowers shall, if any affected Eurodollar Rate Loans are then outstanding, promptly upon request from Agent, either pay all such affected Eurodollar Rate Loans or convert such affected Eurodollar Rate Loans into loans of another type. If any such payment or conversion of any Eurodollar Rate Loan is made on a day that is not the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loan, Borrowers shall pay Agent, upon Agent's request, such amount or amounts as may be necessary to compensate Lenders for any loss or expense sustained or incurred by Lenders in respect of such Eurodollar Rate Loan as a result of such payment or conversion, including (but not limited to) any interest or other amounts payable by Lenders to lenders of funds obtained by Lenders in order to make or maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loan. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted by Lenders to Borrowing Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 2.3. Disbursement of Advance Proceeds. All Advances shall be disbursed -------------------------------- from 28
whichever office or other place Agent may designate from time to time and, together with any and all other Obligations of Borrowers to Agent or Lenders, shall be charged to Borrowers' Account on Agent's books. During the Term, Borrowers may use the Revolving Advances by borrowing, prepaying and reborrowing, all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. The proceeds of each Revolving Advance requested by Borrowing Agent on behalf of any Borrower or deemed to have been requested by any Borrower under Section 2.2(a) hereof shall, with respect to requested Revolving Advances to the extent Lenders make such Revolving Advances, be made available to the applicable Borrower on the day so requested by way of credit to such Borrower's operating account at PNC, or such other bank as Borrowing Agent may designate following notification to Agent, in immediately available federal funds or other immediately available funds or, with respect to Revolving Advances deemed to have been requested by any Borrower, be disbursed to Agent to be applied to the outstanding Obligations giving rise to such deemed request. 2.4. Term Loans. ---------- (a) Term Loan A. Subject to the terms and con-ditions of this ----------- Agreement, each Lender, severally and not jointly, will make a Term Loan A to Borrowers in the sum equal to such Lender's Commitment Percentage of $12,000,000. Term Loan A shall be advanced on the Closing Date and shall be, with respect to principal, payable in equal consecutive quarterly installments, each in the sum of $500,000, commencing April 1, 2006 and continuing on the first day of each July, October, January and April thereafter, until the last day of the Term when the entire unpaid principal sum of Term Loan A shall be payable in full, subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under this Agreement or termination of this Agreement. Term Loan A shall be evidenced by one or more secured promissory notes (collectively, "Term Note A") in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit 2.4(a). --------------- (b) Term Loan B. Subject to the terms and con-ditions of this ----------- Agreement, each Lender, severally and not jointly, will make a Term Loan B to Borrowers in the sum equal to such Lender's Commitment Percentage of $8,000,000. Term Loan B shall be advanced on the Closing Date and shall be, with respect to principal, payable in equal consecutive quarterly installments, each in the sum of $1,000,000, commencing April 1, 2006 and continuing on the first day of each July, October, January and April thereafter, until March 31, 2008 when the entire unpaid principal sum of Term Loan B shall be payable in full, subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under this Agreement or termination of this Agreement. Term Loan B shall be evidenced by one or more secured promissory notes (collectively, "Term Note B") in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit 2.4(b). --------------- 2.5. Maximum Revolving Advances. The aggregate balance of Revolving -------------------------- Advances outstanding at any time shall not exceed the lesser of (a) the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount or (b) the Formula Amount less, in each case, the aggregate Maximum Undrawn Amount of all issued and outstanding Letters of Credit. 2.6. Repayment of Advances. --------------------- (a) The Revolving Advances shall be due and payable in full on the last day of the Term subject to earlier prepayment as herein provided. Term Loan A shall be due and 29
payable as provided in Section 2.4(a) hereof and in Term Note A, subject to mandatory prepayments as herein provided. Term Loan B shall be due and payable as provided in Section 2.4(b) hereof and in Term Note B, subject to mandatory prepayments as herein provided. (b) Each Borrower recognizes that the amounts evidenced by checks, notes, drafts or any other items of payment relating to and/or proceeds of Collateral may not be collectible by Agent on the date received. In consideration of Agent's agreement to conditionally credit Borrowers' Account as of the Business Day on which Agent receives those items of payment, each Borrower agrees that, in computing the charges under this Agreement, all items of payment shall be deemed applied by Agent on account of the Obligations one (1) Business Day after the Business Day Agent receives such payments via wire transfer or electronic depository check. Agent is not, however, required to credit Borrowers' Account for the amount of any item of payment which is unsatisfactory to Agent and Agent may charge Borrowers' Account for the amount of any item of payment which is returned to Agent unpaid. (c) All payments of principal, interest and other amounts payable hereunder, or under any of the Other Documents shall be made to Agent at the Payment Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the due date therefor in lawful money of the United States of America in federal funds or other funds immediately available to Agent. Agent shall have the right to effectuate payment on any and all Obligations due and owing hereunder by charging Borrowers' Account or by making Advances as provided in Section 2.2 hereof.

Statement of Account. Agent shall maintain, in accordance with -------------------- its customary procedures, a loan account ("Borrowers' Account") in the name of Borrowers in which shall be recorded the date and amount of each Advance made by Agent and the date and amount of each payment in respect thereof; provided, however, the failure by Agent to record the date and amount of any Advance shall not adversely affect Agent or any Lender. Each month, Agent shall send to Borrowing Agent a statement showing the accounting for the Advances made, payments made or credited in respect thereof, and other transactions between Agent and Borrowers during such month. The monthly statements shall be deemed correct and binding upon Borrowers in the absence of manifest error and shall constitute an account stated between Lenders and Borrowers unless Agent receives a written statement of Borrowers' specific exceptions thereto within thirty (30) days after such statement is received by Borrowing Agent. The records of Agent with respect to the loan account shall be conclusive evidence absent manifest error of the amounts of Advances and other charges thereto and of payments applicable thereto. 2.9. Letters of Credit. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, ----------------- Agent shall issue or 30
cause the issuance of standby and/or trade Letters of Credit ("Letters of Credit") for the account of any Borrower; provided, however, that Agent will not be required to issue or cause to be issued any Letters of Credit to the extent that the issuance thereof would then cause the sum of (i) the outstanding Revolving Advances plus (ii) the Maximum Undrawn Amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit to exceed the lesser of (x) the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount or (y) the Formula Amount. The Maximum Undrawn Amount of outstanding Letters of Credit shall not exceed in the aggregate at any time the Letter of Credit Sublimit. All disbursements or payments related to Letters of Credit shall be deemed to be Domestic Rate Loans consisting of Revolving Advances and shall bear interest at the applicable Revolving Interest Rate for Domestic Rate Loans; Letters of Credit that have not been drawn upon shall not bear interest. 2.10.

(c) Agent shall use its reasonable efforts to notify Lenders of the request by Borrowing Agent for a Letter of Credit hereunder. 2.11. Requirements For Issuance of Letters of Credit. ---------------------------------------------- (a) In connection with the issuance of any Letter of Credit, Borrowers shall indemnify, save and hold Agent, each Lender and each Issuer harmless from any loss, cost, expense or liability, including payments made by Agent, any Lender or any Issuer and expenses 31
and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by Agent, any Lender or Issuer arising out of, or in connection with, any Letter of Credit to be issued or created for any Borrower. Borrowers shall be bound by Agent's or any Issuer's regulations and good faith interpretations of any Letter of Credit issued or created for Borrowers' Account, although this interpretation may be different from its own; and, neither Agent, nor any Lender, nor any Issuer nor any of their correspondents shall be liable for any error, negligence, or mistakes, whether of omission or commission, in following Borrowing Agent's or any Borrower's instructions or those contained in any Letter of Credit or of any modifications, amendments or supplements thereto or in issuing or paying any Letter of Credit, except for Agent's, any Lender's, any Issuer's or such correspondents' willful misconduct. (b) Borrowing Agent shall authorize and direct any Issuer to name the applicable Borrower as the "Applicant" or "Account Party" of each Letter of Credit. If Agent is not the Issuer of any Letter of Credit, Borrowing Agent shall authorize and direct the Issuer to deliver to Agent all instruments, documents, and other writings and property received by the Issuer pursuant to the Letter of Credit and to accept and rely upon Agent's instructions and agreements with respect to all matters arising in connection with the Letter of Credit, the application therefor or any acceptance therefor. (c) In connection with all Letters of Credit issued or caused to be issued by Agent under this Agreement, each Borrower hereby appoints Agent, or its designee, as its attorney, with full power and authority (i) to sign and/or endorse such Borrower's name upon any warehouse or other receipts, letter of credit applications and acceptances; (ii) to sign such Borrower's name on bills of lading; (iii) to clear Inventory through the United States of America Customs Department ("Customs") in the name of such Borrower or Agent or Agent's designee, and to sign and deliver to Customs officials powers of attorney in the name of such Borrower for such purpose; and (iv) to complete in such Borrower's name or Agent's, or in the name of Agent's designee, any order, sale or transaction, obtain the necessary documents in connection therewith, and collect the proceeds thereof. Neither Agent nor its attorneys will be liable for any acts or omissions nor for any error of judgment or mistakes of fact or law, except for Agent's or its attorney's willful misconduct. This power, being coupled with an interest, is irrevocable as long as any Letters of Credit remain outstanding. 2.12. Disbursements, Reimbursement. ---------------------------- (a) Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from Agent a participation in such Letter of Credit and each drawing thereunder in an amount equal to such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the Maximum Face Amount of such Letter of Credit and the amount of such drawing, respectively. (b) In the event of any request for a drawing under a Letter of Credit by the beneficiary or transferee thereof, Agent will promptly notify Borrowing Agent. Provided that Borrowing Agent shall have received such notice, the Borrowers shall reimburse (such obligation to reimburse Agent shall sometimes be referred to as a "Reimbursement Obligation") Agent prior to 12:00 Noon on each date that an amount is paid by Agent under any Letter of Credit (each such date, a "Drawing Date") in an amount equal to the amount so paid by Agent. 32
In the event Borrowers fail to reimburse Agent for the full amount of any drawing under any Letter of Credit by 12:00 Noon on the Drawing Date, Agent will promptly notify each Lender thereof, and Borrowers shall be deemed to have requested that a Domestic Rate Loan be made by the Lenders to be disbursed on the Drawing Date under such Letter of Credit, subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the lesser of Maximum Revolving Advance Amount or the Formula Amount and subject to Section 8.2 hereof. Any notice given by Agent pursuant to this Section 2.12(b) may be oral if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. (c) Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.12(b) make available to Agent an amount in immediately available funds equal to its Commitment Percentage of the amount of the drawing, whereupon the participating Lenders shall (subject to Section 2.12(d)) each be deemed to have made a Domestic Rate Loan to Borrowers in that amount. If any Lender so notified fails to make available to Agent the amount of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such amount by no later than 2:00 p.m. on the Drawing Date, then interest shall accrue on such Lender's obligation to make such payment, from the Drawing Date to the date on which such Lender makes such payment (i) at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate during the first three days following the Drawing Date and (ii) at a rate per annum equal to the rate applicable to Domestic Rate Loans on and after the fourth day following the Drawing Date. Agent will promptly give notice of the occurrence of the Drawing Date, but failure of Agent to give any such notice on the Drawing Date or in sufficient time to enable any Lender to effect such payment on such date shall not relieve such Lender from its obligation under this Section 2.12(c), provided that such Lender shall not be obligated to pay interest as provided in Section 2.12(c) (i) and (ii) until and commencing from the date of receipt of notice from Agent of a drawing. (d) With respect to any unreimbursed drawing that is not converted into a Domestic Rate Loan to Borrowers in whole or in part as contemplated by Section 2.12(b), because of Borrowers' failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 8.2 (other than any notice requirements) or for any other reason, Borrowers shall be deemed to have incurred from Agent a borrowing (each a "Letter of Credit Borrowing") in the amount of such drawing. Such Letter of Credit Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the rate per annum applicable to a Domestic Rate Loan. Each Lender's payment to Agent pursuant to Section 2.12(c) shall be deemed to be a payment in respect of its participation in such Letter of Credit Borrowing and shall constitute a "Participation Advance" from such Lender in satisfaction of its Participation Commitment under this Section 2.12. (e) Each Lender's Participation Commitment shall continue until the last to occur of any of the following events: (x) Agent ceases to be obligated to issue or cause to be issued Letters of Credit hereunder; (y) no Letter of Credit issued or created hereunder remains outstanding and uncancelled and (z) all Persons (other than the Borrowers) have been fully reimbursed for all payments made under or relating to Letters of Credit. 2.13. Repayment of Participation Advances. ----------------------------------- (a) Upon (and only upon) receipt by Agent for its account of immediately available funds from Borrowers (i) in reimbursement of any payment made by the Agent under 33
the Letter of Credit with respect to which any Lender has made a Participation Advance to Agent, or (ii) in payment of interest on such a payment made by Agent under such a Letter of Credit, Agent will pay to each Lender, in the same funds as those received by Agent, the amount of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such funds, except Agent shall retain the amount of the Commitment Percentage of such funds of any Lender that did not make a Participation Advance in respect of such payment by Agent. (b) If Agent is required at any time to return to any Borrower, or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian, or any official in any insolvency proceeding, any portion of the payments made by Borrowers to Agent pursuant to Section 2.13(a) in reimbursement of a payment made under the Letter of Credit or interest or fee thereon, each Lender shall, on demand of Agent, forthwith return to Agent the amount of its Commitment Percentage of any amounts so returned by Agent plus interest at the Federal Funds Effective Rate. 2.14. Documentation. Each Borrower agrees to be bound by the terms of ------------- the Letter of Credit Application and by Agent's interpretations of any Letter of Credit issued on behalf of such Borrower and by Agent's written regulations and customary practices relating to letters of credit, though Agent's interpretations may be different from such Borrower's own. In the event of a conflict between the Letter of Credit Application and this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern. It is understood and agreed that, except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment), Agent shall not be liable for any error, negligence and/or mistakes, whether of omission or commission, in following the Borrowing Agent's or any Borrower's instructions or those contained in the Letters of Credit or any modifications, amendments or supplements thereto. 2.15. Determination to Honor Drawing Request. In determining whether -------------------------------------- to honor any request for drawing under any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof, Agent shall be responsible only to determine that the documents and certificates required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit have been delivered and that they comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter of Credit and that any other drawing condition appearing on the face of such Letter of Credit has been satisfied in the manner so set forth. 2.16. Nature of Participation and Reimbursement Obligations. Each ----------------------------------------------------- Lender's obligation in accordance with this Agreement to make the Revolving Advances or Participation Advances as a result of a drawing under a Letter of Credit, and the obligations of Borrowers to reimburse Agent upon a draw under a Letter of Credit, shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.16 under all circumstances, including the following circumstances: (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against Agent, any Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the failure of any Borrower or any other Person to comply, in connection with a Letter of Credit Borrowing, with the conditions set forth in this Agreement for the making of a Revolving Advance, it being acknowledged that such conditions are not required 34
for the making of a Letter of Credit Borrowing and the obligation of the Lenders to make Participation Advances under Section 2.12; (iii) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit; (iv) any claim of breach of warranty that might be made by Borrower or any Lender against the beneficiary of a Letter of Credit, or the existence of any claim, set-off, recoupment, counterclaim, crossclaim, defense or other right which any Borrower or any Lender may have at any time against a beneficiary, any successor beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit or the proceeds thereof (or any Persons for whom any such transferee may be acting), Agent or any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transaction (including any underlying transaction between any Borrower or any Subsidiaries of such Borrower and the beneficiary for which any Letter of Credit was procured); (v) the lack of power or authority of any signer of (or any defect in or forgery of any signature or endorsement on) or the form of or lack of validity, sufficiency, accuracy, enforceability or genuineness of any draft, demand, instrument, certificate or other document presented under or in connection with any Letter of Credit, or any fraud or alleged fraud in connection with any Letter of Credit, or the transport of any property or provisions of services relating to a Letter of Credit, in each case even if Agent or any of Agent's Affiliates has been notified thereof; (vi) payment by Agent under any Letter of Credit against presentation of a demand, draft or certificate or other document which does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit absent Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct; (vii) the solvency of, or any acts or omissions by, any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit, or any other Person having a role in any transaction or obligation relating to a Letter of Credit, or the existence, nature, quality, quantity, condition, value or other characteristic of any property or services relating to a Letter of Credit; (viii) any failure by the Agent or any of Agent's Affiliates to issue any Letter of Credit in the form requested by any Borrower, unless the Agent has received written notice from such Borrower of such failure within three (3) Business Days after the Agent shall have furnished Borrower a copy of such Letter of Credit and such error is material and no drawing has been made thereon prior to receipt of such notice; (ix) any Material Adverse Effect on any Borrower or any Guarantor; (x) any breach of this Agreement or any Other Document by any party thereto; (xi) the occurrence or continuance of an insolvency proceeding with respect to any Borrower or any Guarantor; (xii) the fact that a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; 35
(xiii) the fact that the Term shall have expired or this Agreement or the Obligations hereunder shall have been terminated; and (xiv) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing. 2.17. Indemnity. In addition to amounts payable as provided in Section --------- 16.5, each Borrower hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and save harmless Agent and any of Agent's Affiliates that have issued a Letter of Credit from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, taxes, penalties, interest, judgments, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of counsel and allocated costs of internal counsel) which the Agent or any of Agent's Affiliates may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of the issuance of any Letter of Credit, other than as a result of (A) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent as determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or (b) the wrongful dishonor by the Agent or any of Agent's Affiliates of a proper demand for payment made under any Letter of Credit, except if such dishonor resulted from any act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto Governmental Body (all such acts or omissions herein called "Governmental Acts"). 2.18. Liability for Acts and Omissions. As between Borrowers and Agent -------------------------------- and Lenders, each Borrower assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit by, the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the respective foregoing, Agent shall not be responsible for: (i) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection with the application for an issuance of any such Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged (even if Agent shall have been notified thereof); (ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) the failure of the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit, or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred, to comply fully with any conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit or any other claim of any Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit, or any such transferee, or any dispute between or among any Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any such transferee; (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any such Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of Agent, including any governmental acts, and none of the above shall affect or impair, or prevent the vesting of, any of Agent's rights or powers hereunder. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall relieve Agent from liability for Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment) in connection with actions or omissions described in such clauses (i) through (viii) of such sentence. In no event shall Agent or Agent's Affiliates be liable to any Borrower for any 36
indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or special damages or expenses (including attorneys' fees), or for any damages resulting from any change in the value of any property relating to a Letter of Credit. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Agent and each of its Affiliates (i) may rely on any oral or other communication believed in good faith by Agent or such Affiliate to have been authorized or given by or on behalf of the applicant for a Letter of Credit, (ii) may honor any presentation if the documents presented appear on their face substantially to comply with the terms and conditions of the relevant Letter of Credit; (iii) may honor a previously dishonored presentation under a Letter of Credit, whether such dishonor was pursuant to a court order, to settle or compromise any claim of wrongful dishonor, or otherwise, and shall be entitled to reimbursement to the same extent as if such presentation had initially been honored, together with any interest paid by Agent or its Affiliates; (iv) may honor any drawing that is payable upon presentation of a statement advising negotiation or payment, upon receipt of such statement (even if such statement indicates that a draft or other document is being delivered separately), and shall not be liable for any failure of any such draft or other document to arrive, or to conform in any way with the relevant Letter of Credit; (v) may pay any paying or negotiating bank claiming that it rightfully honored under the laws or practices of the place where such bank is located; and (vi) may settle or adjust any claim or demand made on Agent or its Affiliate in any way related to any order issued at the applicant's request to an air carrier, a letter of guarantee or of indemnity issued to a carrier or any similar document (each an "Order") and honor any drawing in connection with any Letter of Credit that is the subject of such Order, notwithstanding that any drafts or other documents presented in connection with such Letter of Credit fail to conform in any way with such Letter of Credit. In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific provisions set forth above, any action taken or omitted by Agent under or in connection with the Letters of Credit issued by it or any documents and certificates delivered thereunder, if taken or omitted in good faith and without gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment), shall not put Agent under any resulting liability to any Borrower or any Lender. 2.19. Additional Payments. Any sums expended by Agent or any Lender ------------------- due to any Borrower's failure to perform or comply with its obligations under this Agreement or any Other Document including any Borrower's obligations under Sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.12, 4.13, 4.14 and 6.1 hereof, may be charged to Borrowers' Account as a Revolving Advance and added to the Obligations. 2.20. Manner of Borrowing and Payment. ------------------------------- (a) Each borrowing of Revolving Advances shall be advanced according to the applicable Commitment Percentages of Lenders. Term Loan A and Term Loan B shall each be advanced according to the Commitment Percentages of Lenders. (b) Each payment (including each prepayment) by any Borrower on account of the principal of and interest on the Revolving Advances, shall be applied to the Revolving Advances pro rata according to the applicable Commitment Percentages of Lenders. Each 37
payment (including each prepayment) by any Borrower on account of the principal of and interest on Term Note A, shall be made from or to, or applied to that portion of Term Loan A evidenced by Term Note A pro rata according to the Commitment Percentages of Lenders. Each payment (including each prepayment) by any Borrower on account of the principal of and interest on the Term Note B, shall be applied to that portion of Term Loan B evidenced by Term Note B pro rata according to the Commitment Percentages of Lenders. Except as expressly provided herein, all payments (including prepayments) to be made by any Borrower on account of principal, interest and fees shall be made without set off or counterclaim and shall be made to Agent on behalf of the Lenders to the Payment Office, in each case on or prior to 1:00 p.m., in Dollars and in immediately available funds. (c) (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Sections 2.20(a) and (b) hereof, commencing with the first Business Day following the Closing Date, each borrowing of Revolving Advances shall be advanced by Agent and each payment by any Borrower on account of Revolving Advances shall be applied first to those Revolving Advances advanced by Agent. On or before 1:00 p.m. on each Settlement Date commencing with the first Settlement Date following the Closing Date, Agent and Lenders shall make certain payments as follows: (I) if the aggregate amount of new Revolving Advances made by Agent during the preceding Week (if any) exceeds the aggregate amount of repayments applied to outstanding Revolving Advances during such preceding Week, then each Lender shall provide Agent with funds in an amount equal to its applicable Commitment Percentage of the difference between (w) such Revolving Advances and (x) such repayments and (II) if the aggregate amount of repayments applied to outstanding Revolving Advances during such Week exceeds the aggregate amount of new Revolving Advances made during such Week, then Agent shall provide each Lender with funds in an amount equal to its applicable Commitment Percentage of the difference between (y) such repayments and (z) such Revolving Advances. (ii) Each Lender shall be entitled to earn interest at the applicable Contract Rate on outstanding Advances which it has funded. (iii) Promptly following each Settlement Date, Agent shall submit to each Lender a certificate with respect to payments received and Advances made during the Week immediately preceding such Settlement Date. Such certificate of Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. (d) If any Lender or Participant (a "benefited Lender") shall at any time receive any payment of all or part of its Advances, or interest thereon, or receive any Collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily or by set-off) in a greater proportion than any such payment to and Collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of such other Lender's Advances, or interest thereon, and such greater proportionate payment or receipt of Collateral is not expressly permitted hereunder, such benefited Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participation in such portion of each such other Lender's Advances, or shall provide such other Lender with the benefits of any such Collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such benefited Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such Collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the other Lenders; provided, however, that if all 38
or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such benefited Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. Each Lender so purchasing a portion of another Lender's Advances may exercise all rights of payment (including rights of set-off) with respect to such portion as fully as if such Lender were the direct holder of such portion. (e) Unless Agent shall have been notified by telephone, confirmed in writing, by any Lender that such Lender will not make the amount which would constitute its applicable Commitment Percentage of the Advances available to Agent, Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) assume that such Lender shall make such amount available to Agent on the next Settlement Date and, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrowers a corresponding amount. Agent will promptly notify Borrowers of its receipt of any such notice from a Lender. If such amount is made available to Agent on a date after such next Settlement Date, such Lender shall pay to Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the daily average Federal Funds Rate (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days) during such period as quoted by Agent, times (ii) such amount, times (iii) the number of days from and including such Settlement Date to the date on which such amount becomes immediately available to Agent. A certificate of Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph (e) shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error. If such amount is not in fact made available to Agent by such Lender within three (3) Business Days after such Settlement Date, Agent shall be entitled to recover such an amount, with interest thereon at the rate per annum then applicable to such Revolving Advances hereunder, on demand from Borrowers; provided, however, that Agent's right to such recovery shall not prejudice or otherwise adversely affect Borrowers' rights (if any) against such Lender. 2.21. Mandatory Prepayments. --------------------- (a) Subject to Sections 2.21(b) and 4.3 hereof, when any Borrower sells or otherwise disposes of any Collateral other than Unencumbered Aircraft or Inventory in the Ordinary Course of Business, Borrowers shall repay the Advances in an amount equal to the net proceeds of such sale (i.e., gross proceeds less the reasonable costs of such sales or other dispositions), such repayments to be made promptly but in no event more than one (1) Business Day following receipt of such net proceeds, and until the date of payment, such proceeds shall be held in trust for Agent. The foregoing shall not be deemed to be implied consent to any such sale otherwise prohibited by the terms and conditions hereof. Such repayments shall be applied to the Revolving Advances in such order as Agent may determine, subject to Borrowers' ability to reborrow Revolving Advances in accordance with the terms hereof. (b) When any Borrower sells or otherwise disposes of Unencumbered Aircraft, it shall not be required to repay Advances if, concurrently with such sale or other disposition, a Borrower grants to Agent a first priority perfected security interest in another Aircraft (the "Replacement Aircraft") having an -------------------- appraised value of not less than 118% of the Aircraft Collateral Value (at the time of such sale or other disposition) of the Unencumbered Aircraft that was the subject of the sale or other disposition. If a Borrower sells or otherwise disposes of Unencumbered Aircraft and does not grant to Agent a security interest in any Replacement Aircraft, it shall repay the Advances in an amount equal to the Aircraft Collateral Value (at the time of such sale or other disposition) of the Unencumbered Aircraft that was the 39
subject of the sale or other disposition. Such repayments shall be made promptly but in no event more than one (1) Business Day following receipt of such net proceeds or disposition, as the case may be, and until the date of payment, such proceeds shall be held in trust for Agent. If the appraised value of the Replacement Aircraft is less than 118% of the Aircraft Collateral Value of the Unencumbered Aircraft that was sold or otherwise disposed of, the Borrower shall repay Advances in an amount equal to the difference between (x) 118% of the Aircraft Collateral Value of the Unencumbered Aircraft that was sold or otherwise disposed of and (y) the appraised value of the Replacement Aircraft. The foregoing shall not be deemed to be implied consent to any such sale otherwise prohibited by the terms and conditions hereof. Such repayments shall be applied (x) first, to the outstanding principal installments of Term Loan B in the inverse order of the maturities thereof, (y) second, to the outstanding principal installments of Term Loan A in the inverse order of the maturities thereof and (z) third, to the remaining Advances in such order as Agent may determine, subject to Borrowers' ability to reborrow Revolving Advances in accordance with the terms hereof. (c) Borrowers shall prepay the outstanding amount of the Advances in an amount equal to 50% of Excess Cash Flow for each fiscal year commencing on or after January 1, 2006, payment in respect of which shall be made in 2007, payable upon delivery of the financial statements to Agent referred to in and required by Section 9.7 for such fiscal year but in any event not later than ninety (90) days after the end of each such fiscal year, which amount shall be applied (x) first, to the outstanding principal installments of Term Loan B in the inverse order of the maturities thereof, (y) second, to the outstanding principal installments of Term Loan A in the inverse order of the maturities thereof and, (z) third, to the remaining Advances in such order as Agent may determine, subject to Borrowers' ability to reborrow Revolving Advances in accordance with the terms hereof. In the event that the financial statement is not so delivered, then a calculation based upon estimated amounts shall be made by Agent upon which calculation Borrowers shall make the prepayment required by this Section 2.21(c), subject to adjustment when the financial statement is delivered to Agent as required hereby. The calculation made by Agent shall not be deemed a waiver of any rights Agent or Lenders may have as a result of the failure by Borrowers to deliver such financial statement. 2.22. Use of Proceeds. --------------- (a) Borrowers shall apply the proceeds of Advances to (i) repay existing indebtedness, including any fees and expenses and prepayment premiums, owed to Purchasers with respect to the Subordinated Note (as such terms are defined in the Original Loan Agreement), (ii) pay fees and expenses relating to the Transactions, (iii) repay Aircraft Indebtedness and (iv) provide for their working capital needs and reimburse drawings under Letters of Credit. (b) Without limiting the generality of Section 2.22(a) above, neither the Borrowers, nor any other Person which may in the future become party to this Agreement or the Other Documents as a Borrower or Guarantor, intends to use nor shall they use any portion of the proceeds of the Advances, directly or indirectly, for any purpose in violation of the Trading with the Enemy Act. 2.23. Defaulting Lender. ----------------- 40
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event any Lender (x) has refused (which refusal constitutes a breach by such Lender of its obligations under this Agreement) to make available its portion of any Advance or (y) notifies either Agent or Borrowing Agent that it does not intend to make available its portion of any Advance (if the actual refusal would constitute a breach by such Lender of its obligations under this Agreement) (each, a "Lender Default"), all rights and obligations hereunder of such Lender (a "Defaulting Lender") as to which a Lender Default is in effect and of the other parties hereto shall be modified to the extent of the express provisions of this Section 2.23 while such Lender Default remains in effect. (b) Advances shall be incurred pro rata from Lenders (the "Non-Defaulting Lenders") which are not Defaulting Lenders based on their respective Commitment Percentages, and no Commitment Percentage of any Lender or any pro rata share of any Advances required to be advanced by any Lender shall be increased as a result of such Lender Default. Amounts received in respect of principal of any type of Advances shall be applied to reduce the applicable Advances of each Lender pro rata based on the aggregate of the outstanding Advances of that type of all Lenders at the time of such application; provided, that, such amount shall not be applied to any Advances of a Defaulting Lender at any time when, and to the extent that, the aggregate amount of Advances of any Non-Defaulting Lender exceeds such Non-Defaulting Lender's Commitment Percentage of all Advances then outstanding. (c) A Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to give instructions to Agent or to approve, disapprove, consent to or vote on any matters relating to this Agreement and the Other Documents. All amendments, waivers and other modifications of this Agreement and the Other Documents may be made without regard to a Defaulting Lender and, for purposes of the definition of "Required Lenders", a Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a Lender and not to have Advances outstanding. (d) Other than as expressly set forth in this Section 2.23, the rights and obligations of a Defaulting Lender (including the obligation to indemnify Agent) and the other parties hereto shall remain unchanged. Nothing in this Section 2.23 shall be deemed to release any Defaulting Lender from its obligations under this Agreement and the Other Documents, shall alter such obligations, shall operate as a waiver of any default by such Defaulting Lender hereunder, or shall prejudice any rights which any Borrower, Agent or any Lender may have against any Defaulting Lender as a result of any default by such Defaulting Lender hereunder. (e) In the event a Defaulting Lender retroactively cures to the satisfaction of Agent the breach which caused a Lender to become a Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender shall no longer be a Defaulting Lender and shall be treated as a Lender under this Agreement. III INTEREST AND FEES. 3.1. Interest. Interest on Advances shall be payable in arrears on the -------- first day of each month with respect to Domestic Rate Loans and, with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, at the end of each Interest Period and at the time of any prepayment hereunder in respect of the prepaid amount. Interest charges shall be computed on the actual principal amount of Advances outstanding during the month at a rate per annum equal to (i) with respect to Revolving 41
Advances, the applicable Revolving Interest Rate, (ii) with respect to Term Loan A, the applicable Term Loan A Rate and (iii) with respect to Term Loan B, the applicable Term Loan B Rate (as applicable, the "Contract Rate"). Whenever, subsequent to the date of this Agreement, the Alternate Base Rate is increased or decreased, the applicable Contract Rate for Domestic Rate Loans shall be similarly changed without notice or demand of any kind by an amount equal to the amount of such change in the Alternate Base Rate during the time such change or changes remain in effect. The Eurodollar Rate shall be adjusted with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans without notice or demand of any kind on the effective date of any change in the Reserve Percentage as of such effective date. Upon and after the occurrence of an Event of Default, and during the continuation thereof, (i) at the option of Agent or at the direction of Required Lenders, the Obligations shall bear interest at the applicable Contract Rate plus two (2%) percent per annum (the "Default Rate"). 3.2. Letter of Credit Fees. --------------------- (a) Borrowers shall pay (x) to Agent, for the ratable benefit of Lenders, fees for each Letter of Credit for the period from and excluding the date of issuance of same to and including the date of expiration or termination, equal to the average daily face amount of each outstanding Letter of Credit multiplied by the difference of (i) the then Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Rate Loans consisting of Revolving Advances per annum minus (ii) one quarter of one percent (0.25%), such fees to be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed and to be payable quarterly in arrears on the first Business Day of each July, October, January and April, and on the last day of the Term, (y) to the Issuer, fronting fees for each Letter of Credit for the period from and excluding the date of issuance of same and including the date of expiration or termination, equal to the average daily face amount of each outstanding Letter of Credit multiplied by one quarter of one percent (0.25%), such fees to be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed and to be payable quarterly in arrears on the first Business Day of each July, October, January and April, and on the last day of the Term and (z) to the Agent for the Agent's sole account the Agent's then in effect customary fees and administrative expenses payable with respect to Letters of Credit as the Agent may generally charge or incur from time to time in connection with the issuance, maintenance, modification (if any), assignment or transfer (if any), negotiation and administration of Letters of Credit (all of the foregoing fees, the "Letter of Credit Fees"). All such charges shall be deemed earned in full on the date when the same are due and payable hereunder and shall not be subject to rebate or proration upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason. Any such charge in effect at the time of a particular transaction shall be the charge for that transaction, notwithstanding any subsequent change in the Issuer's prevailing charges for that type of transaction. All Letter of Credit Fees payable hereunder shall be deemed earned in full on the date when the same are due and payable hereunder and shall not be subject to rebate or proration upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason. Upon and after the occurrence of an Event of Default, and during the continuation thereof, the Letter of Credit Fees may, at Agent's option, and shall, at the direction of Required Lenders, be increased by an additional two percent (2%) per annum. On demand, following the occurrence of an Event of Default, Borrowers will cause cash to be deposited and maintained in an account with Agent, as cash collateral, in an amount equal to one hundred and five percent (105%) of the Maximum Undrawn Amount of all Letters of 42
Credit outstanding from time to time, and each Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes Agent, in its discretion, on such Borrower's behalf and in such Borrower's name, to open such an account and to make and maintain deposits therein, or in an account opened by such Borrower, in the amounts required to be made by such Borrower, out of the proceeds of Receivables or other Collateral or out of any other funds of such Borrower coming into any Lender's possession at any time. Agent will invest such cash collateral (less applicable reserves) in such short-term money-market items as to which Agent and such Borrower mutually agree and the net return on such investments shall be credited to such account and constitute additional cash collateral. No Borrower may withdraw amounts credited to any such account except, if at such time no Event of Default has occurred which is then continuing, upon the expiration of all Letters of Credit. 3.3. Facility Fee. If for any fiscal quarter during the Term, the ------------ average daily unpaid balance of the Revolving Advances plus the average daily outstanding balance of Letters of Credit for each day of such fiscal quarter does not equal the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount, then Borrowers shall pay to Agent for the ratable benefit of Lenders a fee at a rate equal to one quarter of one percent (.25%) per annum on the amount by which the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount exceeds such average daily unpaid balance. Such fee shall be payable to Agent in arrears on the first Business Day of each July, October, January and April, each with respect to the immediately preceding fiscal quarter. 3.4. Fee Letter. Borrowers shall pay the amounts required to be paid ---------- in the Fee Letter in the manner and at the times required by the Fee Letter. 3.5. Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest and fees hereunder -------------------------------- shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and for the actual number of days elapsed. If any payment to be made hereunder becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and interest thereon shall be payable at the applicable Contract Rate for Domestic Rate Loans during such extension. 3.6. Maximum Charges. In no event whatsoever shall interest and other --------------- charges charged hereunder exceed the highest rate permissible under law. In the event interest and other charges as computed hereunder would otherwise exceed the highest rate permitted under law, such excess amount shall be first applied to any unpaid principal balance owed by Borrowers, and if the then remaining excess amount is greater than the previously unpaid principal balance, Lenders shall promptly refund such excess amount to Borrowers and the provisions hereof shall be deemed amended to provide for such permissible rate. 3.7. Increased Costs. In the event that any Applicable Law, treaty or --------------- governmental regulation, or any change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof, or compliance by any Lender (for purposes of this Section 3.7, the term "Lender" shall include Agent or any Lender and any corporation or bank controlling Agent or any Lender) and the office or branch where Agent or any Lender (as so defined) makes or maintains any Eurodollar Rate Loans with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other financial, monetary or other authority, shall: (a) subject Agent or any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or any Other Document or change the basis of taxation of payments to 43
Agent or any Lender of principal, fees, interest or any other amount payable hereunder or under any Other Documents (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of Agent or any Lender by the jurisdiction in which it maintains its principal office); (b) impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, assessment or similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits in or for the account of, advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, any office of Agent or any Lender, including pursuant to Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; or (c) impose on Agent or any Lender or the London interbank Eurodollar market any other condition with respect to this Agreement or any Other Document; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to Agent or any Lender of making, renewing or maintaining its Advances hereunder by an amount that Agent or such Lender deems to be material or to reduce the amount of any payment (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) in respect of any of the Advances by an amount that Agent or such Lender deems to be material, then, in any case Borrowers shall promptly pay Agent or such Lender, upon its demand, such additional amount as will compensate Agent or such Lender for such additional cost or such reduction, as the case may be, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to increased costs which are reflected in the Eurodollar Rate, as the case may be. Agent or such Lender shall certify the amount of such additional cost or reduced amount to Borrowing Agent, and such certification shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 3.8. Basis For Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair. In the -------------------------------------------------------- event that Agent or any Lender shall have determined that: (a) reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate applicable pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof for any Interest Period; or (b) Dollar deposits in the relevant amount and for the relevant maturity are not available in the London interbank Eurodollar market, with respect to an outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loan, a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan, or a proposed conversion of a Domestic Rate Loan into a Eurodollar Rate Loan, then Agent shall give Borrowing Agent prompt written, telephonic or telegraphic notice of such determination. If such notice is given, (i) any such requested Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be made as a Domestic Rate Loan, unless Borrowing Agent shall notify Agent no later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) two (2) Business Days prior to the date of such proposed borrowing, that its request for such borrowing shall be cancelled or made as an unaffected type of Eurodollar Rate Loan, (ii) any Domestic Rate Loan or Eurodollar Rate Loan which was to have been converted to an affected type of Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be continued as or converted into a Domestic Rate Loan, or, if Borrowing Agent shall notify Agent, no later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) two (2) Business Days prior to the proposed conversion, shall be maintained as an unaffected type of Eurodollar Rate Loan, and (iii) any outstanding affected Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be converted into a Domestic Rate Loan, or, if Borrowing Agent shall notify Agent, no later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) two (2) Business Days prior to the last Business Day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such affected Eurodollar Rate Loan, shall be 44
converted into an unaffected type of Eurodollar Rate Loan, on the last Business Day of the then current Interest Period for such affected Eurodollar Rate Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn, Lenders shall have no obligation to make an affected type of Eurodollar Rate Loan or maintain outstanding affected Eurodollar Rate Loans and no Borrower shall have the right to convert a Domestic Rate Loan or an unaffected type of Eurodollar Rate Loan into an affected type of Eurodollar Rate Loan. 3.9. Capital Adequacy. ---------------- (a) In the event that Agent or any Lender shall have determined that any Applicable Law, rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Body, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by Agent or any Lender (for purposes of this Section 3.9, the term "Lender" shall include Agent or any Lender and any corporation or bank controlling Agent or any Lender) and the office or branch where Agent or any Lender (as so defined) makes or maintains any Eurodollar Rate Loans with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on Agent or any Lender's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which Agent or such Lender could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration Agent's and each Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by Agent or any Lender to be material, then, from time to time, Borrowers shall pay upon demand to Agent or such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate Agent or such Lender for such reduction. In determining such amount or amounts, Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging or attribution methods. The protection of this Section 3.9 shall be available to Agent and each Lender regardless of any possible contention of invalidity or inapplicability with respect to the Applicable Law, regulation or condition. (b) A certificate of Agent or such Lender setting forth such amount or amounts as shall be necessary to compensate Agent or such Lender with respect to Section 3.9(a) hereof when delivered to Borrowing Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 3.10. Gross Up for Taxes. If any Borrower shall be required by ------------------ Applicable Law to withhold or deduct any taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under this Agreement or any of the Other Documents to Agent, or any Lender, assignee of any Lender, or Participant (each, individually, a "Payee" and collectively, the "Payees"), (a) the sum payable to such Payee or Payees, as the case may be, shall be increased as may be necessary so that, after making all required withholding or deductions, the applicable Payee or Payees receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deductions been made subject, in the case of a Participant, to the limitation provided in Section 16.3(b) (the "Gross-Up Payment"), (b) such Borrower shall make such withholding or deductions, and (c) such Borrower shall pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with Applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Borrower shall be obligated to make any portion of the Gross-Up Payment that is attributable to any withholding or deductions that would not have been paid or claimed had the applicable Payee or Payees properly claimed a complete exemption with respect thereto pursuant to Section 3.11 hereof. 45
3.11. Withholding Tax Exemption. ------------------------- (a) Each Payee that is not incorporated under the Laws of the United States of America or a state thereof (and, upon the written request of Agent, each other Payee) agrees that it will deliver to Borrowing Agent and Agent two (2) duly completed appropriate valid Withholding Certificates (as defined under Sec.1.1441-1(c)(16) of the Income Tax Regulations ("Regulations")) certifying its status (i.e., U.S. or foreign person) and, if appropriate, making a claim of reduced, or exemption from, U.S. withholding tax on the basis of an income tax treaty or an exemption provided by the Code. The term "Withholding Certificate" means a Form W-9; a Form W-8BEN; a Form W-8ECI; a Form W-8IMY and the related statements and certifications as required under Sec.1.1441-1(e)(2) and/or (3) of the Regulations; a statement described in Sec.1.871-14(c)(2)(v) of the Regulations; or any other certificates under the Code or Regulations that certify or establish the status of a payee or beneficial owner as a U.S. or foreign person. (b) Each Payee required to deliver to Borrowing Agent and Agent a valid Withholding Certificate pursuant to Section 3.11(a) hereof shall deliver such valid Withholding Certificate as follows: (A) each Payee which is a party hereto on the Closing Date shall deliver such valid Withholding Certificate at least five (5) Business Days prior to the first date on which any interest or fees are payable by any Borrower hereunder for the account of such Payee; and (B) each Payee that is an assignee or a Participant shall deliver such valid Withholding Certificate at least five (5) Business Days before the effective date of such assignment or participation (unless Agent in its sole discretion shall permit such Payee to deliver such Withholding Certificate less than five (5) Business Days before such date in which case it shall be due on the date specified by Agent). Each Payee which so delivers a valid Withholding Certificate further undertakes to deliver to Borrowing Agent and Agent two (2) additional copies of such Withholding Certificate (or a successor form) on or before the date that such Withholding Certificate expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent Withholding Certificate so delivered by it, and such amendments thereto or extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably requested by Borrowing Agent or Agent. (c) Notwithstanding the submission of a Withholding Certificate claiming a reduced rate of or exemption from U.S. withholding tax required under Section 3.11(b) hereof, Agent shall be entitled to withhold United States federal income taxes at the full 30% withholding rate if in its reasonable judgment it is required to do so under the due diligence requirements imposed upon a withholding agent under Sec.1.1441-7(b) of the Regulations. Further, Agent is indemnified under Sec.1.1461-1(e) of the Regulations against any claims and demands of any Payee for the amount of any tax it deducts and withholds in accordance with regulations under Sec.1441 of the Code.

If any insurance losses are paid by check, draft or other instrument payable to any Borrower and Agent jointly, Agent may endorse such Borrower's name thereon and do such other things as Agent may deem advisable to reduce the same to cash. Agent is hereby authorized to adjust and compromise claims under insurance coverage referred to in clauses (a) and (b) above. All loss recoveries received by Agent upon any such insurance may be applied to the Obligations in such order as Agent in its sole discretion shall determine; provided, however, as long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred, Agent shall permit Borrowers to use proceeds of insurance losses up to One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000.00) in the aggregate during any fiscal year of Borrowers to repair or replace the damaged Collateral. Any surplus shall be paid by Agent to Borrowers or applied as may be otherwise required by law. (b) The Unencumbered Aircraft of each Borrower at all times shall be maintained in accordance with the requirements of all insurance carriers which provide insurance with respect to the Aircraft of such Borrower so that such insurance shall remain in full force and effect. Each Borrower shall bear the full risk of any loss of any nature whatsoever with respect to the Unencumbered Aircraft. At each Borrower's own cost and expense in amounts customary 51
for companies engaged in businesses similar to the Borrowers and with carriers reasonably acceptable to Agent, each Borrower shall (a) keep all its Unencumbered Aircraft in which such Borrower has an interest insured against the hazards of fire, flood, sprinkler leakage, those hazards covered by extended coverage insurance and such other hazards, and for such amounts, as is customary in the case of companies engaged in businesses similar to such Borrower's (excluding, for purposes of clarification, business interruption insurance); (b) maintain public and product liability insurance against claims for bodily injury, death or property damage suffered by others; (c) furnish Agent with (i) evidence of the maintenance of such policies by the renewal thereof before any expiration date, and copies of all policies promptly following receipt thereof by Borrower, and (ii) appropriate loss payable endorsements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Agent, naming Agent as a co-insured and loss payee with respect to the Collateral as its interests may appear with respect to all insurance coverage referred to in clauses (a) and (b) above, and providing (A) that all proceeds thereunder shall be payable to Agent (and jointly with Agent so long as such proceeds are delivered directly to Agent), (B) no such insurance shall be affected by any act or neglect of the insured or owner of the property described in such policy, and (C) that such policy and loss payable clauses may not be cancelled, amended or terminated unless at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice is given to Agent (provided that such period shall be reduced to ten (10) days in the event of a nonpayment of premium). In the event of any loss thereunder, the carriers named therein hereby are directed by Agent and the applicable Borrower to make payment for such loss to Agent and not to such Borrower and Agent jointly. If any insurance losses are paid by check, draft or other instrument payable to any Borrower and Agent jointly, Agent may endorse such Borrower's name thereon and do such other things as Agent may deem advisable to reduce the same to cash. Upon and after the occurrence of an Event of Default, Agent is hereby authorized to adjust and compromise claims under insurance coverage referred to in clause (a) above. At all times other than when an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the applicable Borrower shall keep Agent advised of the status of all adjustments and compromises of such insurance claims. All loss recoveries received by Agent upon any such insurance may be applied to the Obligations in such order as Agent in its sole discretion shall determine; provided, however, as long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred, Agent shall permit Borrowers to use proceeds of insurance losses up to One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in the aggregate during any fiscal year of Borrowers to repair or replace the damaged Unencumbered Aircraft, or reimburse Borrowers for repair or replacement costs incurred prior to the receipt of the applicable insurance proceeds. Any surplus shall be paid by Agent to Borrowers or applied as may be otherwise required by law. 4.12. Failure to Pay Insurance. If any Borrower fails to obtain ------------------------ insurance as hereinabove provided, or to keep the same in force, Agent, if Agent so elects, may obtain such insurance and pay the premium therefor on behalf of such Borrower, and charge Borrowers' Account therefor as a Revolving Advance of a Domestic Rate Loan and such expenses so paid shall be part of the Obligations. 4.13. Payment of Taxes. Each Borrower will pay, when due, all taxes, ---------------- assessments and other Charges lawfully levied or assessed upon such Borrower or any of the Collateral including real and personal property taxes, assessments and charges and all franchise, income, employment, social security benefits, withholding, and sales taxes.

Borrower and Agent or any Lender which Agent or any Lender may be required to withhold or pay or if any taxes, assessments, or other Charges remain unpaid after the date fixed for their payment, or if any claim shall be made which, in Agent's or any Lender's opinion, may possibly create a valid Lien on the Collateral, Agent may without notice to Borrowers pay the taxes, assessments or other Charges and each Borrower hereby indemnifies and holds Agent and each Lender harmless in respect thereof. The amount of any payment by Agent under this Section 4.13 shall be charged to Borrowers' Account as a Revolving Advance of a Domestic Rate Loan and added to the Obligations and, until Borrowers shall furnish Agent with an indemnity therefor (or supply Agent with evidence satisfactory to Agent that due provision for the payment thereof has been made), Agent may hold without interest any balance standing to Borrowers' credit and Agent shall retain its security interest in and Lien on any and all Collateral held by Agent. 4.14.

Receivables. ----------- (a) Nature of Receivables. Each of the Receivables shall be a --------------------- bona fide and valid account representing a bona fide indebtedness incurred by the Customer therein named, for a fixed sum as set forth in the invoice relating thereto (provided immaterial or unintentional invoice errors shall not be deemed to be a breach hereof) with respect to an absolute sale or lease and delivery of goods upon stated terms of a Borrower, or work, labor or services theretofore rendered by a Borrower as of the date each Receivable is created. Same shall be due and owing in accordance with the applicable Borrower's standard terms of sale without dispute, setoff or counterclaim except as may be reserved against on Borrowers' financial statements and stated on the accounts receivable schedules delivered by Borrowers to Agent. (b) Solvency of Customers. Each Customer, to the best of each --------------------- Borrower's knowledge, as of the date each Receivable is created, is and will be solvent and able to pay all Receivables on which the Customer is obligated in full when due or with respect to such Customers of any Borrower who are not solvent such Borrower has set up on its books and in its financial records bad debt reserves adequate to cover such Receivables, to the extent determined not to be collectible. (c) Location of Borrowers. Each Borrower's chief executive office --------------------- is located at the addresses set forth on Schedule 4.15(c) hereto. Until written ---------------- notice is given to Agent by Borrowing Agent of any other office at which any Borrower keeps its records pertaining to Receivables, all such records shall be kept at such executive office. (d) Collection of Receivables. Until any Borrower's authority to ------------------------- do so is terminated by Agent (which notice Agent may give at any time following the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default or a Default or when Agent in its sole discretion deems it to be in Lenders' best interest to do so), each Borrower will, at such Borrower's sole cost and expense, but on Agent's behalf and for Agent's account, collect as Agent's property and 53
in trust for Agent all amounts received on Receivables, and shall not commingle such collections with any Borrower's funds or use the same except to pay Obligations. Each Borrower shall deposit in the Blocked Account or, upon request by Agent, deliver to Agent, in original form and on the date of receipt thereof, all checks, drafts, notes, money orders, acceptances, cash and other evidences of Indebtedness. (e) Notification of Assignment of Receivables. At any time ----------------------------------------- following the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default or a Default, Agent shall have the right to send notice of the assignment of, and Agent's security interest in and Lien on, the Receivables to any and all Customers or any third party holding or otherwise concerned with any of the Collateral. Thereafter, so long as the Event of Default or Default is continuing, Agent shall have the sole right to collect the Receivables, take possession of the Collateral, or both. Agent's actual collection expenses, including, but not limited to, stationery and postage, telephone and telegraph, secretarial and clerical expenses and the salaries of any collection personnel used for collection, may be charged to Borrowers' Account and added to the Obligations.

XI LENDERS' RIGHTS AND REMEDIES AFTER DEFAULT. 11.1. Rights and Remedies. ------------------- (a) Upon the occurrence of (i) an Event of Default pursuant to Section 10.7 all Obligations shall be immediately due and payable and this Agreement and the obligation of Lenders to make Advances shall be deemed terminated; and, (ii) any of the other Events of Default and at any time thereafter (such default not having previously been cured), at the option of Required Lenders all Obligations shall be immediately due and payable and Lenders shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and to terminate the obligation of Lenders to make Advances. In addition to the foregoing, upon the occurrence of a filing of a petition against any Borrower in any involuntary case under any state or federal bankruptcy laws, the obligation of Lenders to make Advances hereunder shall be terminated other than as may be required by an appropriate order of the bankruptcy court having jurisdiction over such Borrower. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, Agent shall have the right to exercise any and all rights and remedies provided for herein, under the Other Documents, under the Uniform Commercial Code and at law or equity generally, including the right to foreclose the security interests granted herein and to realize upon any Collateral by any available judicial procedure and/or to take possession of and sell any or all of the Collateral with or without judicial process. Agent may enter any of any Borrower's premises or other premises without legal process and without incurring liability to any Borrower therefor, and Agent may thereupon, or at any time thereafter, in its discretion without notice or demand, take the Collateral and remove the same to such place as Agent may deem advisable and Agent may require Borrowers to make the Collateral available to Agent at a convenient place. With or without having the Collateral at the time or place of sale, Agent may sell the Collateral, or any part thereof, at public or private sale, at any time or place, in one or more sales, at such price or prices, and upon such terms, either for cash, credit or future delivery, as Agent may elect. Except as to that part of the Collateral which is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market, Agent shall give Borrowers reasonable notification of such sale or sales, it being agreed that in all events written notice mailed to Borrowing Agent at least ten (10) days prior to such sale or sales is reasonable notification. At any public sale Agent or any Lender may bid for and become the purchaser, and Agent, any Lender or any other purchaser at any such sale thereafter shall hold the Collateral sold absolutely free from any claim or right of whatsoever kind, including any equity of redemption and all such claims, rights and equities are hereby expressly waived and released by each Borrower. In connection with the exercise of the foregoing remedies, including the sale of Inventory, Agent is granted a perpetual nonrevocable, royalty free, nonexclusive license and Agent is granted permission to use all of each Borrower's (a) trademarks, trade styles, trade names, patents, patent applications, copyrights, service marks, licenses, franchises and other proprietary rights which are used or useful in connection with Inventory for the purpose of marketing, advertising for sale and selling or otherwise disposing of such Inventory and (b) Equipment for the purpose of completing the manufacture of unfinished 82
goods. The cash proceeds realized from the sale of any Collateral shall be applied to the Obligations in the order set forth in Section 11.5 hereof. Noncash proceeds will only be applied to the Obligations as they are converted into cash. If any deficiency shall arise, Borrowers shall remain liable to Agent and Lenders therefor. (b) To the extent that Applicable Law imposes duties on the Agent to exercise remedies in a commercially reasonable manner, each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that it is not commercially unreasonable for the Agent (i) to fail to incur expenses reasonably deemed significant by the Agent to prepare Collateral for disposition or otherwise to complete raw material or work in process into finished goods or other finished products for disposition, (ii) to fail to obtain third party consents for access to Collateral to be disposed of, or to obtain or, if not required by other law, to fail to obtain governmental or third party consents for the collection or disposition of Collateral to be collected or disposed of, (iii) to fail to exercise collection remedies against Customers or other Persons obligated on Collateral or to remove Liens on or any adverse claims against Collateral, (iv) to exercise collection remedies against Customers and other Persons obligated on Collateral directly or through the use of collection agencies and other collection specialists, (v) to advertise dispositions of Collateral through publications or media of general circulation, whether or not the Collateral is of a specialized nature, (vi) to contact other Persons, whether or not in the same business as any Borrower, for expressions of interest in acquiring all or any portion of such Collateral, (vii) to hire one or more professional auctioneers to assist in the disposition of Collateral, whether or not the Collateral is of a specialized nature, (viii) to dispose of Collateral by utilizing internet sites that provide for the auction of assets of the types included in the Collateral or that have the reasonable capacity of doing so, or that match buyers and sellers of assets, (ix) to dispose of assets in wholesale rather than retail markets, (x) to disclaim disposition warranties, such as title, possession or quiet enjoyment, (xi) to purchase insurance or credit enhancements to insure the Agent against risks of loss, collection or disposition of Collateral or to provide to the Agent a guaranteed return from the collection or disposition of Collateral, or (xii) to the extent deemed appropriate by the Agent, to obtain the services of other brokers, investment bankers, consultants and other professionals to assist the Agent in the collection or disposition of any of the Collateral. Each Borrower acknowledges that the purpose of this Section 11.1(b) is to provide non-exhaustive indications of what actions or omissions by the Agent would not be commercially unreasonable in the Agent's exercise of remedies against the Collateral and that other actions or omissions by the Agent shall not be deemed commercially unreasonable solely on account of not being indicated in this Section 11.1(b). Without limitation upon the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section11.1(b) shall be construed to grant any rights to any Borrower or to impose any duties on Agent that would not have been granted or imposed by this Agreement or by Applicable Law in the absence of this Section 11.1(b). 11.2. Agent's Discretion. Agent shall have the right in its sole ------------------ discretion to determine which rights, Liens, security interests or remedies Agent may at any time pursue, relinquish, subordinate, or modify or to take any other action with respect thereto and such determination will not in any way modify or affect any of Agent's or Lenders' rights hereunder. 11.3. Setoff. Subject to Section 14.12, in addition to any other ------ rights which Agent or any Lender may have under Applicable Law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default hereunder, Agent and such Lender shall have a right, immediately and 83
without notice of any kind, to apply any Borrower's property held by Agent and such Lender to reduce the Obligations. 11.4. Rights and Remedies not Exclusive. The enumeration of the --------------------------------- foregoing rights and remedies is not intended to be exhaustive and the exercise of any rights or remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other right or remedies provided for herein or otherwise provided by law, all of which shall be cumulative and not alternative. 11.5. Allocation of Payments After Event of Default. Notwithstanding --------------------------------------------- any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all amounts collected or received by the Agent on account of the Obligations or any other amounts outstanding under any of the Other Documents or in respect of the Collateral may, at Agent's discretion, be paid over or delivered as follows: FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) of the Agent in connection with enforcing its rights and the rights of the Lenders under this Agreement and the Other Documents and any protective advances made by the Agent with respect to the Collateral under or pursuant to the terms of this Document; SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Agent; THIRD, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) of each of the Lenders in connection with enforcing its rights under this Agreement and the Other Documents or otherwise with respect to the Obligations owing to such Lender; FOURTH, to the payment of all of the Obligations consisting of accrued fees and interest; FIFTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of the Advances (including the payment or cash collateralization of any outstanding Letters of Credit); SIXTH, to all other Obligations and other obligations which shall have become due and payable under the Other Documents or otherwise and not repaid pursuant to clauses "FIRST" through "FIFTH" above, in such order as shall then be determined by the Agent in its sole discretion; and SEVENTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whoever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus. In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be applied in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next succeeding category; (ii) each of the Lenders shall receive (so long as it is not a Defaulting Lender) an amount equal to its pro rata share (based on the proportion that the then outstanding Advances held by such Lender bears to the aggregate then outstanding Advances) of amounts available to be applied pursuant to clauses "FOURTH", "FIFTH" and "SIXTH" above; and (iii) to the extent that any amounts available for distribution pursuant to clause "FIFTH" above are attributable to the issued but undrawn amount of outstanding Letters of Credit, such amounts shall be held by the Agent in a cash collateral 84
account and applied (A) first, to reimburse the Issuer from time to time for any drawings under such Letters of Credit and (B) then, following the expiration of all Letters of Credit, to all other obligations of the types described in clauses "FIFTH" and "SIXTH" above in the manner provided in this Section 11.5].

Nature of Duties. Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities ---------------- except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the Other Documents. Neither Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees or agents shall be (i) liable for any action taken or omitted by them as such hereunder or in connection herewith, unless caused by their gross (not mere) negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment), or (ii) responsible in any manner for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Borrower or any officer thereof contained in this 86
Agreement, or in any of the Other Documents or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any of the Other Documents or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, due execution, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement, or any of the Other Documents or for any failure of any Borrower to perform its obligations hereunder. Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any of the Other Documents, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Borrower. The duties of Agent as respects the Advances to Borrowers shall be mechanical and administrative in nature; Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender; and nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement except as expressly set forth herein. 14.3. Lack of Reliance on Agent and Resignation. Independently and ----------------------------------------- without reliance upon Agent or any other Lender, each Lender has made and shall continue to make (i) its own independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of each Borrower and each Guarantor in connection with the making and the continuance of the Advances hereunder and the taking or not taking of any action in connection herewith, and (ii) its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of each Borrower and each Guarantor. Agent shall have no duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before making of the Advances or at any time or times thereafter except as shall be provided by any Borrower pursuant to the terms hereof. Agent shall not be responsible to any Lender for any recitals, statements, information, representations or warranties herein or in any agreement, document, certificate or a statement delivered in connection with or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, collectibility or sufficiency of this Agreement or any Other Document, or of the financial condition of any Borrower or any Guarantor, or be required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement, the Note, the Other Documents or the financial condition of any Borrower, or the existence of any Event of Default or any Default. Agent may resign on sixty (60) days' written notice to each of Lenders and Borrowing Agent and upon such resignation, the Required Lenders will promptly designate a successor Agent reasonably satisfactory to Borrowers. Any such successor Agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of Agent, and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon its appointment, and the former Agent's rights, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Agent. After any Agent's resignation as Agent, the provisions of this Article XIV shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement. 14.4. Certain Rights of Agent. If Agent shall request instructions ----------------------- from Lenders with respect to any act or action (including failure to act) in connection with this Agreement or any Other Document, Agent shall be entitled to refrain from such act or taking such action unless and until Agent shall have received instructions from the Required Lenders; and Agent shall not 87
incur liability to any Person by reason of so refraining. Without limiting the foregoing, Lenders shall not have any right of action whatsoever against Agent as a result of its acting or refraining from acting hereunder in accordance with the instructions of the Required Lenders. 14.5. Reliance. Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully -------- protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution, notice, statement, certificate, telex, teletype or telecopier message, cablegram, order or other document or telephone message believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper person or entity, and, with respect to all legal matters pertaining to this Agreement and the Other Documents and its duties hereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by it. Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be liable for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by Agent with reasonable care. 14.6. Notice of Default. Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge ----------------- or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder or under the Other Documents, unless Agent has received notice from a Lender or Borrowing Agent referring to this Agreement or the Other Documents, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that Agent receives such a notice, Agent shall give notice thereof to Lenders. Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders; provided, that, unless and until Agent shall have received such directions, Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of Lenders. 14.7. Indemnification. To the extent Agent is not reimbursed and --------------- indemnified by Borrowers, each Lender will reimburse and indemnify Agent in proportion to its respective portion of the Advances (or, if no Advances are outstanding, according to its Commitment Percentage), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against Agent in performing its duties hereunder, or in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any Other Document; provided that, Lenders shall not be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from Agent's gross (not mere) negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment). 14.8. Agent in its Individual Capacity. With respect to the obligation -------------------------------- of Agent to lend under this Agreement, the Advances made by it shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Lender and as if it were not performing the duties as Agent specified herein; and the term "Lender" or any similar term shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender. Agent may engage in business with any Borrower as if it were not performing the duties specified herein, and may accept fees and other consideration from any Borrower for services in connection with this Agreement or otherwise without having to account for the same to Lenders. 14.9. Delivery of Documents. To the extent Agent receives financial --------------------- statements required under Sections 9.7, 9.8, 9.9, 9.12 and 9.13 or Borrowing Base Certificates from any 88
Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Agreement which any Borrower is not obligated to deliver to each Lender, Agent will promptly furnish such documents and information to Lenders. 14.10. Borrowers' Undertaking to Agent. Without prejudice to their ------------------------------- respective obligations to Lenders under the other provisions of this Agreement, each Borrower hereby undertakes with Agent to pay to Agent from time to time on demand all amounts from time to time due and payable by it for the account of Agent or Lenders or any of them pursuant to this Agreement to the extent not already paid. Any payment made pursuant to any such demand shall pro tanto satisfy the relevant Borrower's obligations to make payments for the account of Lenders or the relevant one or more of them pursuant to this Agreement. 14.11. No Reliance on Agent's Customer Identification Program. Each ------------------------------------------------------ Lender acknowledges and agrees that neither such Lender, nor any of its Affiliates, participants or assignees, may rely on the Agent to carry out such Lender's, Affiliate's, participant's or assignee's customer identification program, or other obligations required or imposed under or pursuant to the USA PATRIOT Act or the regulations thereunder, including the regulations contained in 31 CFR 103.121 (as hereafter amended or replaced, the "CIP Regulations"), or any other Anti-Terrorism Law, including any programs involving any of the following items relating to or in connection with any Borrower, its Affiliates or its agents, this Agreement, the Other Documents or the transactions hereunder or contemplated hereby: (1) any identity verification procedures, (2) any record-keeping, (3) comparisons with government lists, (4) customer notices or (5) other procedures required under the CIP Regulations or such other laws. 14.12. Other Agreements. Each of the Lenders agrees that it shall not, ---------------- without the express consent of Agent, and that it shall, to the extent it is lawfully entitled to do so, upon the request of Agent, set off against the Obligations, any amounts owing by such Lender to any Borrower or any deposit accounts of any Borrower now or hereafter maintained with such Lender. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, each of the Lenders further agrees that it shall not, unless specifically requested to do so by Agent, take any action to protect or enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement or the Other Documents, it being the intent of Lenders that any such action to protect or enforce rights under this Agreement and the Other Documents shall be taken in concert and at the direction or with the consent of Agent or Required Lenders. XV BORROWING AGENCY. 15.1. Borrowing Agency Provisions. --------------------------- (a) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably designates Borrowing Agent to be its attorney and agent and in such capacity to borrow, sign and endorse notes, and execute and deliver all instruments, documents, writings and further assurances now or hereafter required hereunder, on behalf of such Borrower or Borrowers, and hereby authorizes Agent to pay over or credit all loan proceeds hereunder in accordance with the request of Borrowing Agent. (b) The handling of this credit facility as a co-borrowing facility with a borrowing agent in the manner set forth in this Agreement is solely as an accommodation to Borrowers and at their request. Neither Agent nor any Lender shall incur liability to Borrowers 89
as a result thereof. To induce Agent and Lenders to do so and in consideration thereof, each Borrower hereby indemnifies Agent and each Lender and holds Agent and each Lender harmless from and against any and all liabilities, expenses, losses, damages and claims of damage or injury asserted against Agent or any Lender by any Person arising from or incurred by reason of the handling of the financing arrangements of Borrowers as provided herein, reliance by Agent or any Lender on any request or instruction from Borrowing Agent or any other action taken by Agent or any Lender with respect to this Section 15.1 except due to willful misconduct or gross (not mere) negligence by the indemnified party (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgment). (c) All Obligations shall be joint and several, and each Borrower shall make payment upon the maturity of the Obligations by acceleration or otherwise, and such obligation and liability on the part of each Borrower shall in no way be affected by any extensions, renewals and forbearance granted to Agent or any Lender to any Borrower, failure of Agent or any Lender to give any Borrower notice of borrowing or any other notice, any failure of Agent or any Lender to pursue or preserve its rights against any Borrower, the release by Agent or any Lender of any Collateral now or thereafter acquired from any Borrower, and such agreement by each Borrower to pay upon any notice issued pursuant thereto is unconditional and unaffected by prior recourse by Agent or any Lender to the other Borrowers or any Collateral for such Borrower's Obligations or the lack thereof. Each Borrower waives all suretyship defenses. 15.2. Waiver of Subrogation. Each Borrower expressly waives any and --------------------- all rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnity, exoneration, contribution of any other claim which such Borrower may now or hereafter have against the other Borrowers or other Person directly or contingently liable for the Obligations hereunder, or against or with respect to the other Borrowers' property (including any property which is Collateral for the Obligations), arising from the existence or performance of this Agreement, until termination of this Agreement and repayment in full of the Obligations. XVI MISCELLANEOUS. 16.1. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed ------------- in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applied to contracts to be performed wholly within the State of New York. Any judicial proceeding brought by or against any Borrower with respect to any of the Obligations, this Agreement, the Other Documents or any related agreement may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction in the State of New York, United States of America, and, by execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Borrower accepts for itself and in connection with its properties, generally and unconditionally, the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts, and irrevocably agrees to be bound by any judgment rendered thereby in connection with this Agreement. Each Borrower hereby waives personal service of any and all process upon it and consents that all such service of process may be made by registered mail (return receipt requested) directed to Borrowing Agent at its address set forth in Section 16.6 and service so made shall be deemed completed five (5) days after the same shall have been so deposited in the mails of the United States of America, or, at the Agent's option, by service upon Borrowing Agent which each Borrower irrevocably appoints as such Borrower's Agent for the purpose of accepting service within the State of New York. Nothing herein shall affect the right to serve process in any manner permitted by law or shall limit the right of Agent or any Lender 90
to bring proceedings against any Borrower in the courts of any other jurisdiction. Each Borrower waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue of any action instituted hereunder and shall not assert any defense based on lack of jurisdiction or venue or based upon forum non conveniens. Each Borrower waives the right to remove any judicial proceeding brought against such Borrower in any state court to any federal court. Any judicial proceeding by any Borrower against Agent or any Lender involving, directly or indirectly, any matter or claim in any way arising out of, related to or connected with this Agreement or any related agreement, shall be brought only in a federal or state court located in the County of New York, State of New York. 16.2. Entire Understanding. -------------------- (a) This Agreement and the documents executed concurrently herewith contain the entire understanding between each Borrower, Agent and each Lender and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, if any, relating to the subject matter hereof. Any promises, representations, warranties or guarantees not herein contained and hereinafter made shall have no force and effect unless in writing, signed by each Borrower's, Agent's and each Lender's respective officers. Neither this Agreement nor any portion or provisions hereof may be changed, modified, amended, waived, supplemented, discharged, cancelled or terminated orally or by any course of dealing, or in any manner other than by an agreement in writing, signed by the party to be charged. Each Borrower acknowledges that it has been advised by counsel in connection with the execution of this Agreement and Other Documents and is not relying upon oral representations or statements inconsistent with the terms and provisions of this Agreement. (b) The Required Lenders, Agent with the consent in writing of the Required Lenders, and Borrowers may, subject to the provisions of this Section 16.2 (b), from time to time enter into written supplemental agreements to this Agreement or the Other Documents executed by Borrowers, for the purpose of adding or deleting any provisions or otherwise changing, varying or waiving in any manner the rights of Lenders, Agent or Borrowers thereunder or the conditions, provisions or terms thereof of waiving any Event of Default thereunder, but only to the extent specified in such written agreements; provided, however, that no such supplemental agreement shall, without the consent of all Lenders: (i) increase the Commitment Percentage, the maximum dollar commitment of any Lender or the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount. (ii) extend the maturity of any Note or the due date for any amount payable hereunder, or decrease the rate of interest or reduce any fee payable by Borrowers to Lenders pursuant to this Agreement. (iii) alter the definition of the term Required Lenders or alter, amend or modify this Section 16.2(b) or Section 2.2(f). (iv) release any Collateral during any calendar year (other than in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement) having an aggregate value in excess of $1,000,000. (v) change the rights and duties of Agent. 91
(vi) permit any Revolving Advance to be made if after giving effect thereto the total of Revolving Advances outstanding hereunder would exceed the Formula Amount for more than thirty (30) consecutive Business Days or exceed one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the Formula Amount. (vii) increase the Advance Rates above the Advance Rates in effect on the Closing Date. (viii) release any Guarantor. Any such supplemental agreement shall apply equally to each Lender and shall be binding upon Borrowers, Lenders and Agent and all future holders of the Obligations. In the case of any waiver, Borrowers, Agent and Lenders shall be restored to their former positions and rights, and any Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing, but no waiver of a specific Event of Default shall extend to any subsequent Event of Default (whether or not the subsequent Event of Default is the same as the Event of Default which was waived), or impair any right consequent thereon. In the event that Agent requests the consent of a Lender pursuant to this Section 16.2 and such Lender shall not respond or reply to Agent in writing within five (5) days of delivery of such request, such Lender shall be deemed to have consented to the matter that was the subject of the request. In the event that Agent requests the consent of a Lender pursuant to this Section 16.2 and such consent is denied, then PNC may, at its option, require such Lender to assign its interest in the Advances to PNC or to another Lender or to any other Person designated by the Agent (the "Designated Lender"), for a price equal to (i) the then outstanding principal amount thereof plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest and fees due such Lender, which interest and fees shall be paid when collected from Borrowers less (iii) the amount of the closing fee received by such Lender pursuant to the terms hereof or of any of the Other Documents multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months remaining in the then current Term of the Agreement and the denominator of which is the total number of months from the Closing Date until the end of the Term. In the event PNC elects to require any Lender to assign its interest to PNC or to the Designated Lender, PNC will so notify such Lender in writing within forty five (45) days following such Lender's denial, and such Lender will assign its interest to PNC or the Designated Lender no later than five (5) days following receipt of such notice pursuant to a Commitment Transfer Supplement executed by such Lender, PNC or the Designated Lender, as appropriate, and Agent. Notwithstanding (a) the existence of a Default or an Event of Default, (b) that any of the other applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 8.2 hereof have not been satisfied or (c) any other provision of this Agreement, Agent may at its discretion and without the consent of the Required Lenders, voluntarily permit the outstanding Revolving Advances at any time to exceed the Formula Amount by up to ten percent (10%) of the Formula Amount for up to thirty (30) consecutive Business Days (the "Out-of-Formula Loans"). If Agent is willing in its sole and absolute discretion to make such Out-of-Formula Loans, such Out-of-Formula Loans shall be payable on demand and shall bear interest at the Default Rate for Revolving Advances consisting of Domestic Rate Loans; provided that, if Lenders do make Out-of-Formula Loans, neither Agent nor Lenders shall be deemed thereby to have changed the limits of Section 2.1(a). For 92
purposes of this paragraph, the discretion granted to Agent hereunder shall not preclude involuntary overadvances that may result from time to time due to the fact that the Formula Amount was unintentionally exceeded for any reason, including, but not limited to, Collateral previously deemed to be either "Eligible Receivables", "Eligible Third Party Receivables" or "Eligible Inventory", as applicable, becomes ineligible, collections of Receivables applied to reduce outstanding Revolving Advances are thereafter returned for insufficient funds or overadvances are made to protect or preserve the Collateral. In the event Agent involuntarily permits the outstanding Revolving Advances to exceed the Formula Amount by more than ten percent (10%), Agent shall use its efforts to have Borrowers decrease such excess in as expeditious a manner as is practicable under the circumstances and not inconsistent with the reason for such excess. Revolving Advances made after Agent has determined the existence of involuntary overadvances shall be deemed to be involuntary overadvances and shall be decreased in accordance with the preceding sentence. In addition to (and not in substitution of) the discretionary Revolving Advances permitted above in this Section 16.2, the Agent is hereby authorized by Borrowers and the Lenders, from time to time in the Agent's sole discretion, (A) after the occurrence and during the continuation of a Default or an Event of Default, or (B) at any time that any of the other applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 8.2 hereof have not been satisfied, to make Revolving Advances to Borrowers on behalf of the Lenders which the Agent, in its reasonable business judgment, deems necessary or desirable (a) to preserve or protect the Collateral, or any portion thereof, (b) to enhance the likelihood of, or maximize the amount of, repayment of the Advances and other Obligations, or (c) to pay any other amount chargeable to Borrowers pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; provided, that at any time after giving effect to any such Revolving Advances the outstanding Revolving Advances do not exceed one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the Formula Amount. 16.3. Successors and Assigns; Participations; New Lenders. --------------------------------------------------- (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Borrowers, Agent, each Lender, all future holders of the Obligations and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Borrower may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Agent and each Lender. (b) Each Borrower acknowledges that in the regular course of commercial banking business one or more Lenders may at any time and from time to time sell participating interests in the Advances to other financial institutions (each such transferee or purchaser of a participating interest, a "Participant"). Each Participant may exercise all rights of payment (including rights of set-off) with respect to the portion of such Advances held by it or other Obligations payable hereunder as fully as if such Participant were the direct holder thereof provided that Borrowers shall not be required to pay to any Participant more than the amount which it would have been required to pay to Lender which granted an interest in its Advances or other Obligations payable hereunder to such Participant had such Lender retained such interest in the Advances hereunder or other Obligations payable hereunder and in no event shall Borrowers be required to pay any such amount arising from the same circumstances and with respect to the same Advances or other Obligations payable hereunder to both such Lender and such Participant. Each Borrower hereby grants to any Participant a continuing security interest in any deposits, 93
moneys or other property actually or constructively held by such Participant as security for the Participant's interest in the Advances. (c) Any Lender may with the consent of Agent which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed sell, assign or transfer all or any part of its rights under this Agreement and the Other Documents to one or more additional banks or financial institutions and one or more additional banks or financial institutions may commit to make Advances hereunder (each a "Purchasing Lender", and together with each Participant, each a "Transferee" and collectively the "Transferees"), in minimum amounts of not less than $5,000,000, pursuant to a Commitment Transfer Supplement, executed by a Purchasing Lender, the transferor Lender, and Agent and delivered to Agent for recording. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the transfer effective date determined pursuant to such Commitment Transfer Supplement, (i) Purchasing Lender thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, have the rights and obligations of a Lender thereunder with a Commitment Percentage as set forth therein, and (ii) the transferor Lender thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, be released from its obligations under this Agreement, the Commitment Transfer Supplement creating a novation for that purpose. Such Commitment Transfer Supplement shall be deemed to amend this Agreement to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of such Purchasing Lender and the resulting adjustment of the Commitment Percentages arising from the purchase by such Purchasing Lender of all or a portion of the rights and obligations of such transferor Lender under this Agreement and the Other Documents. Each Borrower hereby consents to the addition of such Purchasing Lender and the resulting adjustment of the Commitment Percentages arising from the purchase by such Purchasing Lender of all or a portion of the rights and obligations of such transferor Lender under this Agreement and the Other Documents. Borrowers shall execute and deliver such further documents and do such further acts and things in order to effectuate the foregoing. (d) Agent shall maintain at its address a copy of each Commitment Transfer Supplement delivered to it and a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names and addresses of each Lender and the outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest and other fees due hereunder. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and Borrowers, Agent and Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the Advance recorded therein for the purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by Borrowers or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. Agent shall receive a fee in the amount of $3,500 payable by the applicable Purchasing Lender upon the effective date of each transfer or assignment to such Purchasing Lender. (e) Each Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Transferee and any prospective Transferee any and all financial information in such Lender's possession concerning such Borrower which has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of such Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with such Lender's credit evaluation of such Borrower. 16.4. Application of Payments. Agent shall have the continuing and ----------------------- exclusive right to apply or reverse and re-apply any payment and any and all proceeds of Collateral to any portion 94
of the Obligations. To the extent that any Borrower makes a payment or Agent or any Lender receives any payment or proceeds of the Collateral for any Borrower's benefit, which are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, debtor in possession, receiver, custodian or any other party under any bankruptcy law, common law or equitable cause, then, to such extent, the Obligations or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continue as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by Agent or such Lender. 16.5. Indemnity. Each Borrower shall indemnify Agent, each Lender and --------- each of their respective officers, directors, Affiliates, attorneys, employees and agents from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including fees and disbursements of counsel) which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against Agent or any Lender in any claim, litigation, proceeding or investigation instituted or conducted by any Governmental Body or instrumentality or any other Person with respect to any aspect of, or any transaction contemplated by, or referred to in, or any matter related to, this Agreement or the Other Documents, whether or not Agent or any Lender is a party thereto, except to the extent that any of the foregoing arises out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party being indemnified (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgment). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this indemnity shall extend to any liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) asserted against or incurred by any of the indemnitees described above in this Section 16.5 by any Person under any Environmental Laws or similar laws by reason of any Borrower's or any other Person's (other than the party being indemnified) failure to comply with laws applicable to solid or hazardous waste materials, including Hazardous Substances and Hazardous Waste, or other Toxic Substances. Additionally, if any taxes (excluding taxes imposed upon or measured solely by the net income of Agent and Lenders, but including any intangibles taxes, stamp tax, recording tax or franchise tax) shall be payable by Agent, Lenders or Borrowers on account of the execution or delivery of this Agreement, or the execution, delivery, issuance or recording of any of the Other Documents, or the creation or repayment of any of the Obligations hereunder, by reason of any Applicable Law now or hereafter in effect, Borrowers will pay (or will promptly reimburse Agent and Lenders for payment of) all such taxes, including interest and penalties thereon, and will indemnify and hold the indemnitees described above in this Section 16.5 harmless from and against all liability in connection therewith. 16.6. Notice. Any notice or request hereunder may be given to ------ Borrowing Agent or any Borrower or to Agent or any Lender at their respective addresses set forth below or at such other address as may hereafter be specified in a notice designated as a notice of change of address under this Section. Any notice, request, demand, direction or other communication (for purposes of this Section 16.6 only, a "Notice") to be given to or made upon any party hereto under any provision of this Loan Agreement shall be given or made by telephone or in writing (which includes by means of electronic transmission (i.e., "e-mail") or facsimile transmission or by setting forth such Notice on a site on the World Wide Web (a "Website Posting") if Notice of such Website Posting (including the information necessary to access such site) has previously been delivered to the applicable parties hereto by another means set forth in this Section 16.6) in accordance with this Section 16.6.

EXHIBIT 99.1 [GRAPHIC OMITTED] Air Methods - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company AIR METHODS REPORTS 2Q2005 RESULTS Company Earns $0.30 of Basic EPS, Inclusive of $0.17 Per Share Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt DENVER, CO., August 9, 2005 -- Air Methods Corporation (NASDAQ: AIRM) reported results for the quarter ended June 30, 2005. Revenue increased 18% to $87.7 million from $74.3 million in the year-ago quarter. For the six-month period, revenue increased 15% to $156.2 million, up from $135.9 million in the prior-year six-month period. For the quarter, net income increased 32% to $3.3 million ($0.30 per basic and $0.29 per diluted share) as compared with prior-year quarter net income of $2.5 million ($0.23 per basic and $0.22 per diluted share). Net income for the six-month period was $2.9 million ($0.26 per basic and $0.25 per diluted share) compared to $10.6 million ($0.97 per basic and $0.94 per diluted share) for the prior-year six-month period. The current year quarter and six-month period includes a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $3.1 million before the effect of income taxes. Net of income taxes, this loss reduced quarterly and six-month net income by $1.9 million, or $0.17 per basic share. By refinancing its $23 million in subordinated notes, the Company reduced its effective interest rate by over 9%, based on current rates. The prior-year six-month period results include a first quarter increase to net income of $8.6 million, or $0.79 per basic and $0.76 per diluted share, from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax effect. Income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was $2.0 million, or $0.18 per basic and diluted share, for the prior-year six-month period. SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Community-Based Operations: Revenue from community-based operations increased 19% to $60.6 million, and segment net income increased 80% to $7.9 million during the second quarter, as compared with the prior-year quarter. The increase in segment net income was primarily attributed to increases in net revenue after bad debt expense per transport, which increased from $4,414 in the prior-year quarter to $5,221 in the current quarter. Net revenue after bad debt expense per transport was $5,122 during the first quarter of 2005. The increase in net reimbursement was attributed to price increases and improved billing and collection processes. Community-based transports completed during the second quarter were 8,560 as compared with 8,010 in the prior-year quarter. Community-based transports for bases in operation greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) increased by 47, or less than 1%, while weather cancellations for bases in operation greater than one year decreased by 53, or 4%, from the prior-year quarter. Hospital-Based Operations: Revenue from hospital-based operations increased by 15% to $25.3 million and segment net income increased 136% to $2.8 million during the second quarter as compared with the prior-year quarter. These increases were primarily attributed to decreases in maintenance expenses relative to flight fees. Divisional maintenance expense decreased by approximately 1%, while divisional flight fees increased by about 20%. The division also benefited from net contribution associated with $1.8 million in increased quarterly revenue from new operating bases begun either during or subsequent to the prior-year second quarter. Products Division: Revenue, including revenue generated from internal projects, increased 11% to $3.5 million, while segment net income remained constant at $0.8 million during the second quarter as compared with the prior-year quarter. Segment net income did not increase in proportion to revenue growth due to changes in product mix which reduced the overall margin percentage. Aaron Todd, Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are obviously pleased with our strong financial performance. We are especially pleased to have generated healthy top-line and bottom-line growth from both services divisions. Base expansion, moderate weather and on-budget maintenance expenses have combined with significantly improved net reimbursement per transport to generate these strong quarterly results. We remain very optimistic that our goal to achieve strong year-over-year financial results is well within reach."
"We are happy to report that our third quarter has begun with healthy flight volume in July. Same-Base Transports for community-based operations during the month were 5% higher than July 2004, despite higher weather-related flight cancellations which increased 23% over the prior-year month. July flight volume exceeded June volume by 158 transports, even though flights missed due to weather were 132 higher than in June. We believe this indicates that our efforts to improve utilization at our existing operating bases through marketing and outreach programs are leading to positive results. Additionally, we believe that interest savings from our refinancing of the subordinated notes should also contribute to improved overall performance during the remainder of 2005," said Todd. The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern.

EXHIBIT 99.1 AIR METHODS - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company AIR METHODS REPORTS 3Q2005 RESULTS Company Earns $0.50 of Basic EPS, Revenue Increases 31% to $90.5 Million DENVER, CO., November 9, 2005 -- Air Methods Corporation (NASDAQ: AIRM) reported results for the quarter ended September 30, 2005. Revenue increased 31% to $90.5 million from $68.9 million in the year-ago quarter. For the nine-month period, revenue increased 20% to $246.7 million, up from $204.8 million in the prior-year nine-month period. For the quarter, net income increased over 2.7 times to $5.5 million ($0.50 per basic and $0.47 per diluted share) as compared with prior-year quarter net income of $1.5 million ($0.13 per basic and diluted share). Net income for the nine-month period was $8.4 million ($0.76 per basic and $0.72 per diluted share) compared to $12.0 million ($1.11 per basic and $1.06 per diluted share) for the prior-year nine-month period. The current year nine-month period includes a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $3.1 million before the effect of income taxes. Net of income taxes, this loss reduced nine-month net income by $1.9 million, or $0.17 per basic share. The prior-year nine-month period results include a first quarter increase to net income of $8.6 million, or $0.79 per basic and $0.76 per diluted share, from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax effect. Income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was $3.4 million, or $0.32 per basic and $0.30 per diluted share, for the prior-year nine-month period. Third Quarter Highlights Community-Based Operations: Revenue from community-based operations increased 42% to $61.8 million, and segment net income increased nearly two-fold to $7.7 million during the third quarter, as compared with $2.7 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase in segment net income was primarily attributed to increases in net revenue after bad debt expense per transport, which increased from $4,339 in the prior-year quarter to $5,072 in the current quarter. The increase in net reimbursement was attributed to price increases and improved billing and collection processes. Community-based transports completed during the third quarter were 8,733 as compared with 8,018 in the prior-year quarter. Community-based transports for bases in operation greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) increased by 251, or 3%, while weather cancellations for bases in operation greater than one year increased by 354, or 27%, from the prior-year quarter. Improvement in segment net income was also attributed to a decrease in maintenance expense per flight hour as compared with the prior year quarter. Even with flight hours increasing by 18%, maintenance expense was relatively unchanged at $5.4 million, as compared with the prior-year quarter. This decrease in maintenance expense per flight hour was attributed, in part, to fewer engine overhaul events, deployment of new aircraft with lower per hour costs, and redeployment of older aircraft with higher per hour costs into lower use environments. Hospital-Based Operations: Revenue from hospital-based operations increased by 12% to $26.3 million and segment net income increased over 2.4 times to $3.1 million during the third quarter as compared with $0.9 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase in revenue is primarily attributed to the expansion of eight existing contracts either during or subsequent to the third quarter of 2004 and from annual price increases. The increase in segment net income is primarily attributed to decreases in maintenance expenses relative to revenue flight hours. Divisional maintenance expense decreased by approximately 11% to $7.2 million, while divisional revenue flight hours increased by about 11%. This decrease in maintenance expense was attributed to the same factors as those stated above within the community-based operations. The division also benefited from net contribution earned on $2.1 million in incremental quarterly revenue from new operating bases begun either during or subsequent to the prior-year third quarter. Products Division: Revenue, including revenue generated from internal projects, increased 7% to $3.9 million, while segment net income decreased by 37% to $0.8 million during the third quarter as compared with the prior-year quarter. Segment net income did not increase in proportion to revenue growth due to changes in product mix which reduced the overall margin percentage.
Aaron Todd, Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are pleased that our third quarter financial results reflect a continuation of the strong performance experienced during the second quarter of this year. Reimbursement rates for community-based operations have remained healthy, while related Same-Base Transport flight volumes have shown growth, despite increases in weather cancellations. The overall decrease in maintenance expense, even with growth in flight volume, confirms that our fleet rejuvenation initiatives are helping to moderate our maintenance expenditures. We also have continued to benefit from reduced interest expense attributed to the refinancing of our subordinated debt during the second quarter. We will continue to see this benefit over the next three quarters, as well." "We are also happy to report that our fourth quarter has begun with healthy flight volume in October. Same-Base Transports for community-based operations during the month were 7% or 165 transports higher than October 2004, while weather-related flight cancellations decreased by 33% or 285 transports over the prior-year month, " said Todd. The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern.

EXHIBIT 99.1 [GRAPHIC OMITTED] Air Methods - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company AIR METHODS ANNOUNCES YEAR 2005 FINANCIAL RESULTS AND PROVIDES FIRST QUARTER 2006 UPDATE Community-Based Flight Volume Remained Strong Through February 2006 DENVER, CO., March 14, 2006 -- Air Methods Corporation (NASDAQ: AIRM), the largest air medical transportation company in the world, reported revenue and net results for the year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2005. For the year, revenue increased 23% to $337.0 million compared to $273.1 million in the prior year. Net income, including a loss on early extinguishment of debt, was $11.8 million or $1.07 per basic share ($1.02 per diluted share) compared to $11.8 million or $1.09 per basic share ($1.05 per diluted share) in the prior year. The current year results include a second quarter loss on early extinguishment of debt of $3.1 million before the effect of income taxes. Net of income taxes, this loss reduced current year net income by $1.9 million, or $0.17 per basic share. The prior-year period includes an increase to net income of $8.6 million, or $0.79 per basic ($0.76 per diluted share), from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax effect. Prior-year net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was $3.2 million or $0.30 per basic ($0.29 per diluted share). For the fourth quarter, revenue increased 32% to $90.2 million as compared with $68.3 million during the prior-year period. Net income increased to $3.5 million or $0.31 per basic share ($0.29 per diluted share), compared to a net loss of $0.2 million or $.02 per basic and diluted share in the prior-year period. The $3.7 million increase in fourth quarter earnings was partially attributed to a significant increase in patients transported for community bases in operation greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) and from an increase in net revenue after bad debt expense per transport for community-based operations. Same-Base Transports increased 359 or 5% over the prior-year quarter. This improvement was entirely attributed to a decrease in weather-related cancellations of 375 transports for these same bases. During the 2005 fourth quarter, total patients transported within community-based operations were 7,808 as compared with 7,143 during the prior-year quarter. Net revenue after bad debt per community-based transport increased 21% to $5,996 from $4,967 in the prior-year quarter, while day's sales outstanding in receivables net of bad debt for consolidated operations increased from 98 days as of December 31, 2004 and 102 days as of September 30, 2005 to 105 days as of current year-end. The improvement in net reimbursement per transport is primarily attributed to price increases and improved collection trends, while the increase in day's sales outstanding is attributed to the previously discussed third quarter 2005 software system upgrade and fourth quarter 2005 centralization of community-based billing operations. Fourth quarter 2005 results also reflect significant improvement in divisional net income from the Company's hospital-based operations. Divisional net income increased to $2.0 million compared to a loss of $0.9 million in the prior-year quarter. This improvement was primarily attributed to contributions from new operating bases. Finally, the fourth quarter of 2005 was positively affected from reduced interest expense attributed to the refinancing of the subordinated indebtedness in the second quarter of 2005. The Company also provided an update on first quarter 2006 flight volume. Community-based flight volume through the first two-months of 2006 has been very healthy due to significant decreases in weather-related cancellations. Same-Base Transports within the community-based operations through February were up 705 or 18% as compared with the prior-year quarter. Of this amount, 591 transports, or 84% of the increase, were attributed to decreases in weather cancellations. March community-based transports have been strong month-to-date, as well.
Aaron Todd, CEO of Air Methods, commented, "We are obviously pleased with our improvement in operating results for the fourth quarter and year ended 2005 within both our community-based and hospital-based operations. Increased same-base transports, improved collections, our fleet rejuvenation initiatives and lowered interest expense have all combined to help us achieve our goals and produce record operating results during 2005. Our financial results have provided sufficient cash flows to fund our working capital needs, while also allowing us to reduce our long-term debt position by over $11.6 million during the year." Mr. Todd added, "We are also very pleased with the healthy growth in community-based flight volume thus far in 2006, and we remain highly focused on efforts to reduce our day's sales outstanding as we complete the centralization of our billing and collection function. We anticipate more normal levels being achieved in mid-2006. We are also pleased with having reached the recently announced tentative agreement with our pilots' union. We have and will continue to adjust our pricing for community-based services to help ensure that our higher costs of operations do not penalize our ability to provide these valuable services and to achieve reasonable returns for our shareholders."

EXHIBIT 99.1 [GRAPHIC OMITTED] Air Methods - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company AIR METHODS REPORTS 1Q2006 RESULTS AND 2Q2006 UPDATE Quarterly Revenue Increases 30.5%; Fully Diluted EPS Increases to $0.21 April Community-Based Flight Volume Remained Strong DENVER, CO., May 9, 2006 -- Air Methods Corporation (NASDAQ: AIRM), the largest air medical transportation company in the world, reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2006 and provided an update of second quarter 2006 flight volumes. Revenue increased 30.5% to $89.4 million from $68.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Net income for the first quarter of 2006 was $2.6 million or $0.22 per basic share ($0.21 per diluted share), compared with a net loss of $(0.5) million or $(0.04) per basic and diluted share in the first quarter of 2005. The $3.0 million increase in net income was primarily attributed to increases in patients transported from community bases in operation greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) and from an increase in net revenue after bad debt expense per transport for community-based operations. For the quarter, Same-Base Transports increased by 907 patients or 14.0%. Of this amount, 551 transports were directly attributed to a decrease in missed flights due to weather cancellations as compared with the prior-year quarter. During the 2006 first quarter, total patients transported within community-based operations were 7,612 as compared with 6,738 in the prior-year quarter. Net revenue, after bad debt expense, per community-based transport increased 16.8% to $5,978 from $5,118, while days' sales outstanding in receivables, net of bad debt reserves, for consolidated operations increased from 99 days as of March 31, 2005 and 105 days as of December 31, 2005, to 111 days as of March 31, 2006. The improvement in net reimbursement per transport is primarily attributed to price increases, while the increase in days' sales outstanding during the current quarter was previously anticipated due to recent centralization of community-based billing operations. For the first quarter, community-based operations revenue increased 31.9% to $45.5 million compared to $34.5 million, net of bad debt expense, while current period divisional net income increased to $6.8 million from $0.5 million. Hospital-based operations revenue increased 18.9% to $26.6 million compared to $22.4 million, while divisional net income decreased from $0.6 million to a $(0.2) million loss in the current period. The decrease in profitability within the hospital-based operations was primarily attributed to higher labor costs associated with the new collective bargaining agreement with the pilot workforce and higher maintenance costs due to an increase in overhaul events. For consolidated flight operations, pilot wages, overtime pay and benefits increased $1.7 million during the quarter from the implementation of the collective bargaining agreement, effective January 1, 2006. The incremental cost associated with the collective bargaining agreement does not reflect reductions for inflationary adjustments that would have otherwise applied. External revenue and divisional net income from external contracts for the Products Division remained relatively unchanged at $1.6 million and $0.4 million, respectively, as compared with the prior-year quarter. The Company also provided an update on second quarter 2006 flight volume. Total community-based transports of 2,902 during the month of April compare favorably with an average of 2,537 per month during the first quarter of 2006 and 2,704 during April of 2005. Same-Base Transports during the month of April increased by 123 transports or 4.6% as compared with the prior-year month. Weather cancellations for community bases in operation greater than one year decreased by 15 transports as compared with the prior-year month.
Aaron Todd, CEO, stated, "Our first quarter results reflect a continuation of growth in both revenue and earnings driven by improved flight volume, increased reimbursement and new base expansion. We are pleased with our financial performance, especially when considering the first-year implementation costs associated with the new pilot collective bargaining agreement have been included in these results. We are encouraged by the continued growth in Same-Base Transports in April and will continue our focus on reducing our days' sales outstanding within our net receivables now that the centralization of our billing function is nearing completion." Mr. Todd added, "We continue to enjoy numerous opportunities to expand our flight operations within both the community-based and hospital-based operations. Since we have multiple new aircraft already on order, we believe we are better able to take advantage of many of these opportunities despite the current limitation in aircraft availability from manufacturers through 2007." The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern.

EXHIBIT 99.1 [LOGO OMITTED] Air Methods - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company AIR METHODS PROVIDES 2ND QUARTER UPDATE Reduction in Net Reimbursement per Community-Based Transport to Affect Quarterly Results DENVER, CO., July 20, 2006 -- Air Methods Corporation (NASDAQ: AIRM), the largest air medical transportation company in the world, provided an update on second quarter 2006 results. Based on preliminary quarterly results, net revenue after bad debt per community-based transport decreased from $5,978 in the first quarter of 2006, to $5,559 in the second quarter. Based on total community-based transports of 8,926 during the current quarter, net reduction to pre-tax earnings was approximately $3.7 million. The reduction in reimbursement rate was experienced during the first two months of the quarter and was attributed to a shift in payer mix from insured patients to uninsured and Medicaid categories, as well as to increases in bad debt reserves from lower than anticipated collections. For the month of June, net revenue after bad debt per community-based transport improved significantly to $6,306 due to improvement in payer mix back to recent historical levels and a mid-month price increase of approximately 7%. These preliminary results are subject to final post-closing adjustments and quarter-end review procedures. Aaron Todd, CEO, stated, "We are obviously disappointed by the reduction in reimbursement rate during the first two months of our second quarter and the related impact on earnings. While it is difficult to predict fluctuations in reimbursement, we are encouraged by the strong rebound in rates in June. We believe this is a good indication that the deterioration in payer mix during April and May reflects normal short-term inherent fluctuations instead of a long-term trend. With the added benefit of the mid-June price increase, combined with strong month-to-date flight volumes in July, we remain optimistic that our third quarter operations will see a return to strong earnings performance." Air Methods Corporation (www.airmethods.com) is a leader in emergency ------------------ aeromedical transportation and medical services. The Air Medical Services Division is the largest provider of air medical transport services for hospitals. The LifeNet Division is the largest community-based provider of air medical services. The Products Division specializes in the design and manufacture of aeromedical and aerospace technology. The Company's fleet of owned, leased or maintained aircraft features approximately 200 helicopters and fixed wing aircraft.

SECTION 2 ITEM 2.02.

EXHIBIT 99.1 AIR METHODS - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company AIR METHODS REPORTS 2Q2006 RESULTS AND 3Q2006 UPDATE Company Earns $0.31 Diluted EPS; Revenue Grows 21% DENVER, CO., August 8, 2006 -- Air Methods Corporation (NASDAQ: AIRM) reported results for the quarter ended June 30, 2006. Revenue increased 21% to $105.9 million from $87.7 million in the year-ago quarter. For the six-month period, revenue increased 25% to $195.2 million, up from $156.2 million in the prior-year six-month period. For the quarter, net income increased 15% to $3.8 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, as compared with prior-year quarter net income of $3.3 million, or $0.29 per diluted share. Net income for the six-month period was $6.4 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, compared to $2.9 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the prior-year six-month period. The prior-year quarter and six-month period include a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $3.1 million before the effect of income taxes. Net of income taxes, this loss reduced prior-year quarterly and six-month net income by $1.9 million, or $0.16 per diluted share. The current-year quarter includes a $0.6 million pre-tax gain from disposition of assets, offset in part by $0.3 million of accrued severance expense before tax benefit associated with changes of two management positions. As previously reported, the current-year second quarter results reflect a decrease in net revenue after bad debt per community-based transport from $5,978 in the first quarter of 2006, to $5,559 in the current quarter. Net reduction to pre-tax earnings attributed to the decline in reimbursement rate was approximately $3.7 million. The decrease was attributed to a shift in payer mix from insured patients to uninsured and Medicaid categories, as well as to increases in bad debt reserves from lower than anticipated collections. SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Community-Based Operations: Revenue from community-based operations increased 25% to $75.4 million, while segment net income decreased 6% to $7.4 million during the second quarter, as compared with $7.9 million in the prior-year quarter. The decrease in segment net income was primarily attributed to weaker than anticipated reimbursement rates as discussed above. Although net revenue after bad debt expense per transport increased from $5,221 in the prior-year quarter to $5,559 in the current quarter, the second quarter rate reflected a $419 per transport decrease from first quarter 2006 results. Community-based transports completed during the second quarter were 8,924 as compared with 8,562 in the prior-year quarter. Community-based transports for bases in operation greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) decreased slightly by 48, or less than 1%, while weather cancellations for bases in operation greater than one year increased by 116, or 9%, from the prior-year quarter. Community-based operations also experienced a 19% increase in fuel cost per flight hour during the current-year quarter as compared with the prior-year quarter. This resulted in a $0.4 million increase in fuel expense based on hours flown. Hospital-Based Operations: Revenue from hospital-based operations increased by 13% to $28.5 million, while segment net income decreased from $2.8 million during the prior-year second quarter to break-even results in the current quarter. The decrease in earnings is primarily attributed to a $0.8 million increase in pilot compensation expenses associated with implementation of a new collective bargaining agreement effective January 1, 2006. The decrease is also attributed to increases in maintenance expense per transport which increased from $531 in the prior-year quarter to $717 in the current-year quarter, a 35% increase. Products Division: Revenue, including revenue generated from internal projects, increased 23% to $4.2 million, while segment net income increased 41% to $1.1 million during the second quarter as compared with the prior-year quarter. Growth in segment net income outpaced growth in revenue due to change in product mix. Aaron Todd, Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We continue to remain optimistic that the severity of the change in payer mix during the second quarter does not reflect a longer-term trend. We have seen a significant improvement in both June and July as compared with the three-month period ended in May. Days' sales outstanding for community-based operations began to decline in May, a trend we expect to continue throughout the summer months.
"We are pleased to report that our third quarter has begun with healthy flight volume in July as well. Community-based transports increased to 3,282 in July, as compared with 2,981 in June and 2,981 in July of 2005. Our operating margins have been affected by higher inflationary pressures attributed to first-year implementation of the pilots' collective bargaining agreement, as well as to employee benefits, fuel, and spare parts; however, we believe strong market conditions and recent price increases should provide for improving margins looking forward," said Todd. The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern. Interested parties can access the call by dialing (888) 396-5640 (domestic) or (706) 643-0580 (international) or by accessing the web cast at www.airmethods.com.

EXHIBIT 99.1 [LOGO OMITTED] Air Methods - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company AIR METHODS REPORTS 3Q2006 RESULTS AND 4Q2006 UPDATE Company Earns $0.78 Diluted EPS; Revenue Grows 28% DENVER, CO., November 7, 2006 -- Air Methods Corporation (NASDAQ: AIRM) reported results for the quarter ended September 30, 2006. Revenue increased 28% to $116.1 million from $90.5 million in the year-ago quarter. For the nine-month period, revenue increased 26% to $310.8 million, up from $246.7 million in the prior-year nine-month period. For the quarter, net income increased 75% to $9.6 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, as compared with prior-year quarter net income of $5.5 million, or $0.47 per diluted share. Net income for the nine-month period was $16.0 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, compared to $8.4 million, or $0.72 per diluted share for the prior-year nine-month period. The prior-year nine-month period includes a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $3.1 million before the effect of income taxes. Net of income taxes, this loss reduced net income for the nine-month period in the prior year by $1.9 million, or $0.16 per diluted share. The current-year quarter includes a $1.4 million pre-tax gain from a litigation settlement. Net of income taxes, this gain increased net income by $0.9 million, or $0.07 per diluted share. THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Community-Based Operations: Revenue from community-based operations increased 40% to $86.7 million, and segment net income increased 140% to $18.6 million during the third quarter, as compared with $7.7 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase in segment net income was primarily attributed to increases in net revenue after bad debt expense per transport, which increased from $5,072 in the prior-year quarter to $6,716 in the current quarter. The increase in net reimbursement was attributed to price increases and to increases to bad debt reserves during the prior-year quarter for lower than anticipated collections. The current-year quarter collections were mostly in-line with expectations. Days' sales outstanding for community-based operations decreased by 13 days during the quarter. Community-based transports completed during the third quarter were 9,186 as compared with 8,733 in the prior-year quarter. Community-based transports for bases in operation greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) decreased by 332, or 4%, due to higher weather cancellations. Weather cancellations for bases in operation greater than one year increased by 427, or 27%, from the prior-year quarter. Segment net income in the current-year quarter also reflects the above stated $1.4 million gain from the settlement of a lawsuit for lost revenue associated with a fatal accident in 2002. Maintenance expense increased by $1.2 million, or 22%, despite only a 5% increase in patients transported, due to higher overhaul and parts replacement events and inflationary influences. Hospital-Based Operations: Revenue from hospital-based operations increased by 8% to $28.4 million, while segment net income decreased from $3.1 million during the prior-year third quarter, to a net loss of $0.1 million in the current-year quarter. The increase in revenue is primarily attributed to the expansion of six existing contracts, the addition of two new contracts either during or subsequent to the third quarter of 2005, and annual price increases. The decrease in segment earnings is partially attributed to increases in pilot compensation and benefits of $0.9 million related to the implementation of the collective bargaining agreement effective January 1, 2006. The decrease is also attributed to a $2.8 million, or 41%, increase in maintenance expense, despite a 3% decrease in patient flights, due to higher overhaul and parts replacement events, and inflationary influences. Products Division: Revenue, including revenue generated from internal projects, increased 78% to $7.0 million, while segment net income increased by 86% to $1.5 million during the third quarter as compared with the prior-year quarter. The majority of the revenue (80%) and segment net income (65%) related to internal projects and has been eliminated in the consolidated financial results.
Aaron Todd, Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are obviously pleased that our third quarter financial results reflect a return to strong year-over-year growth in both top line and bottom line. As anticipated, reimbursement rates for community-based operations improved significantly over this year's second quarter and prior-year third quarter, while our days' sales outstanding have decreased. We are especially pleased to have generated strong results given the impact of weather in reducing our Same-Base Transports and the higher than usual maintenance costs incurred during the quarter." "We are also happy to report that our fourth quarter has begun with healthy flight volume in October. Community-based transports increased 10% to 2,972 in October, as compared with 2,706 in October of last year. Same-Base Transports for community-based operations during the month were 84 transports, or 3%, higher than October 2005, while weather-related flight cancellations decreased by 83 transports, or 13%, over the prior-year month. Although the increase in the cost of our operations continues to outpace the rate of inflation, we remain confident that eventual moderation in maintenance activity levels, combined with strong market conditions and increased pricing, should provide for continued earnings growth moving forward. In addition, we anticipate continued growth in our operations through base expansions at a similar pace to recent quarters," said Todd. The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern.

EXHIBIT 99.1 AIR METHODS [LOGO OMITTED] - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company AIR METHODS CORPORATION PROVIDES UPDATE ON 2006 4TH QUARTER AND YEAR-END EVENTS DENVER, CO, March 1, 2007 -- Air Methods Corporation (NasdaqGS: AIRM) announced today that its independent auditors have accepted the Company's request to change its method of accounting for revenue and estimated uncompensated care (previously referred to as bad debt expense) to a more preferred method. Effective December 31, 2006, the Company will now present revenue and estimated uncompensated care on a net basis within the consolidated statement of operations. Previously, the Company recorded revenue at full established rates and recorded a provision for estimated amounts not expected to be realized as an operating expense. Prior periods will be reclassified to reflect the new accounting presentation in the 2006 financial statements. The change will have no impact on cash flows from operations, operating income, net income, or earnings per share as reported in the current and prior years. The Company also announced that with the significant increase in taxable earnings generated in 2006, it now estimates that its effective federal income tax rate in current and future periods will increase from 34% to the highest level of 35%. The change in estimate increased federal income taxes above the new 35% federal income tax rate by approximately $771,000 or $0.06 per fully-diluted share for the fourth quarter and $496,000 or $0.04 per fully-diluted share for the year. This excess was primarily attributed to applying the new 35% federal income tax rate to the Company's current and deferred net tax liabilities. The Company also announced that its December 2006 aviation accident will impact net income (net of income taxes) by approximately $561,000 or $0.05 per share for the fourth quarter and year ended 2006. This amount includes the uninsured portion of the aircraft book value, self-insured workers compensation benefits, and estimated missed flights due to out-of-service time. The Company does not anticipate any further material financial impacts from the accident for future periods. The Company anticipates announcing 2006 year end results on March 8th, pending final completion of year-end auditing procedures.

EXHIBIT 99.1 Air Methods - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company AIR METHODS ANNOUNCES YEAR 2006 FINANCIAL RESULTS AND PROVIDES FIRST QUARTER 2007 UPDATE DENVER, CO., March 8, 2007 -- Air Methods Corporation (NasdaqGS: AIRM), the largest air medical transportation company in the world, reported revenue and net income for the year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006. For the year, revenue increased 16% to $319.5 million compared to $276.2 million in the prior year. Net income, was $17.2 million or $1.40 per diluted share compared to $11.8 million or $1.02 per diluted share. As previously disclosed, the current year results include a $0.5 million ($0.04 per diluted share) increase in income tax expense above the highest federal tax rate of 35%, resulting from the application of the new higher expected rate to deferred income tax liabilities. The prior year results included a loss on early extinguishment of debt, net of income taxes, of $1.9 million or $0.16 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter, revenue increased 5% to $77.5 million as compared with $73.6 million during the prior-year period. Net income decreased to $1.2 million or $0.10 per diluted share compared to net income of $3.5 million or $0.29 per diluted share in the prior-year period. As previously disclosed, the current-year quarter results include a $0.8 million ($0.06 per diluted share) increase in income tax expense above the highest federal tax rate of 35%, resulting from the application of the new higher expected rate to current and deferred income tax liabilities. In addition the current-year quarter net income was decreased by $0.6 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, from the impact of an aviation accident experienced in December 2006. The current and prior period revenue amounts are presented net of reserves for uncompensated care, pursuant to the recently announced change in accounting policy. The decrease in net income for the fourth quarter is primarily attributed to the items discussed above. In addition, net revenue per community-based transport was below expectation for the quarter due to lower than anticipated collections. Net revenue per community-based transport decreased slightly from $5,996 in the prior-year quarter to $5,958 in the current period, despite price increases during 2006. The lower than anticipated collection rate was attributed to normal fluctuations inherent in the collection process, since change in payer mix was not significant between the two periods. During the fourth quarter of 2006, total patients transported within community-based operations were 8,382 as compared with 7,809 during the prior-year quarter. Patients transported for community bases in operation greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) increased by 78 patients or 1%, while weather cancellations for these same bases increased by 42 transports, compared with the prior-year period. For the year 2006, Same-Base Transports increased by 615 or 2%, while weather cancellations for community-bases in operation greater than one year increased by 173 patient transports, as compared with the prior year. The Company also provided an update on first quarter 2007 flight volume. Same-Base Transports within community-based operations through February were down 185 patient transports or 4% as compared with the prior-year period, while weather cancellations for these same bases increased 26 transports compared with the prior-year period. In addition, reduction in requests for service, which are not reflected in weather cancellations, was attributed to more severe weather conditions.
Aaron Todd, CEO of Air Methods, commented, "We are proud of our 2006 financial results. Our ability to generate strong growth in earnings during a period of high inflation in our cost of labor and flight operations is evidence of our strong position within the air medical industry. While our quarterly results continue to reflect high variability, the long-term trends continue to demonstrate year-over-year growth in both revenue and earnings." Mr. Todd added, "Despite the impact of weather on transports during the first two months of 2007, we remain very optimistic in our ability to achieve year-over-year earnings growth. We anticipate improving margins within our hospital-based operations in 2007 due to projected moderation in our maintenance expenditures and to anticipated price increases on contract renewals. We expect continued growth in Same-Base Transports for community-based operations, adjusted for weather variations, and will continue to expand the number of operating bases in 2007. In addition, reimbursement rates continue to be positively affected by periodic price increases, as reimbursement rates for insured patients have kept pace with recent increases overall." The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern. Interested parties can access the call by dialing (888) 396-5640 (domestic) or (706) 643-0580 (international) or by accessing the web cast at www.airmethods.com.

EXHIBIT 99.1 AIR METHODS - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company AIR METHODS REPORTS 1Q2007 RESULTS AND 2Q2007 UPDATE Quarterly Revenue Increases 11.5%; Fully Diluted EPS Increases 42.9% to $0.30 per Share DENVER, CO., May 9, 2007 -- Air Methods Corporation (NasdaqGS: AIRM), the largest air medical transportation company in the world, reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2007 and provided an update on April 2007 flight volumes. For the quarter, revenue increased 11.5% to $81.5 million from $73.0 million in the year-ago quarter. Net income for the first quarter of 2007 was $3.7 million or $0.30 per diluted share, compared with net income of $2.6 million or $0.21 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2006. The increase in net income is primarily attributed to improved reimbursement per community-based transport during the quarter and reductions in maintenance expense. Net revenue per community-based transport increased 7.9% from $5,971 in the prior-year quarter to $6,443 in the current-year quarter. Maintenance expense for the current year quarter decreased 17.1% or $2.3 million, as compared with the prior-year quarter, even though total flight volume decreased by less than 1%. The increase in net income was offset in part by a reduction in community-based transports for bases in operation greater than one year (Same-Base Transports), partially attributed to more severe weather conditions. Same-Base Transports decreased by 262 transports or 3.5% as compared with the prior-year quarter. Although weather cancellations increased by only 45 for bases in operation greater than one year, the reduction in Same-Base Transports was also attributed to shifting of transports to the Company's newly opened bases in adjacent locations. Total patients transported within the community-based operations increased from 7,612 in the prior-year quarter to 8,284 during the first quarter of 2007, an 8.8% increase. For the first quarter, community-based revenue increased 17.3% to $53.4 million compared to $45.5 million in the prior year, while current period segment net income increased 16.5% to $7.9 million from $6.8 million. Hospital-based flight revenue decreased slightly from $26.0 million to $25.8 million in the current-year period, while segment net income increased from a loss of $0.2 million in the prior-year period to net income of $1.8 million in the current period. The increase in profitability within the hospital-based operations segment was primarily attributed to the decrease in maintenance expense referenced above, offset in part by lower-than-anticipated flight volume attributed to more severe weather conditions. Same-base flight volume within the hospital-based operations decreased 5.7% as compared with the prior-year quarter. The Company also provided an update on April 2007 flight volume. Total community-based transports were 3,071 during April 2007 compared with 2,908 in April 2006. Same-Base Transports during the month of April decreased by 158 transports or 5.6% as compared with April 2006. Weather cancellations decreased by 67 transports for community bases in operation greater than one year during April 2007. The decrease in Same-Base Transports, despite a decrease in weather cancellations, was also attributed to shifting of transports to newly opened bases, as described above.
Aaron Todd, CEO, stated, "We have begun 2007 with very strong earnings growth. We are pleased to have achieved these results despite the impact of weather on our first quarter flight volume. Our fleet modernization efforts, combined with fewer maintenance events during the quarter, favorably impacted our maintenance expenditures. In addition, collections from our community-based transports remained strong. Days' sales outstanding in receivables at March 31, 2007 for community-based transports decreased eleven days as compared with March 31, 2006. In addition, our cash collections were at record levels in April. We continue to anticipate another year of strong growth in both revenue and net income given these strong fundamentals." The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern.

The Seller agrees to reimburse the Buyer for that portion of the premium that is deemed allocable to pre-closing events.  Any recovery that may be realized under any such insurance that is obtained by the Company and is related to or arises out of pre-closing events shall be deemed to reduce or offset any amounts that might be payable pursuant to Section 10.2 by reason of Sellers indemnification of Buyer for losses or claims that arose as a result of events or transactions prior to the Closing.

Procedure Upon Termination.  In the event of termination of this Agreement by Buyer, the Company, or Seller pursuant to Section 11.1, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other parties hereto and the transactions contemplated herein shall be abandoned without further action by Buyer, the Company, or the Seller.  In addition, if this Agreement is terminated as provided herein:
 
11.2
   
 
(a)           Each party will redeliver all documents, work papers and other material of any other party relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, whether so obtained before or after the execution hereof, to the party furnishing the same.
 
(b)           All Confidential Information shall continue to be subject to the provisions of Article XII of this Agreement, which provisions shall survive any such termination.
 
27
(c)           Upon a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(a), the respective obligations of the parties hereto under this Agreement (other than under Sections 11.2(a) and (b) above and Section 11.4 below) shall terminate and no party shall have any liability whatsoever to any other party hereto by reason of such termination.  Any termination of this Agreement by Buyer pursuant to Section 11.1(d) or (e) due to a Material Seller Default, or by Seller pursuant to Section 11.1(b) or (c) due to a Material Buyer Default, shall not relieve Seller or the Buyer (as the case may be) of its liability hereunder to the non-defaulting party.  If, notwithstanding a Material Seller Default or a Material Buyer Default, the Buyer (in the case of a Material Seller Default), or Seller (in the case of a Material Buyer Default) closes the transactions contemplated hereby, such action by the non-defaulting party or parties shall constitute a waiver of such Material Seller Default or Material Buyer Default, as the case may be.

Specific Performance Upon Termination. Buyer, on the one hand, and the Company and Seller, on the other hand, acknowledge that because an award of monetary damages would be inadequate for any breach of this Agreement by the other party, Buyer, the Company and Seller, as the case may be, shall be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance.

SECTION 2
On August 9, 2007, Air Methods Corporation (the Company") announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2007. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report. The information contained in this report, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall information be deemed incorporated by reference in any registration statement, proxy statement, or other report filed under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, unless the Company specifically incorporates that information into those documents by reference.
SIGNATURES
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company
 
DENVER, CO., August 9, 2007 -- Air Methods Corporation (NasdaqGS: AIRM) reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2007.  Revenue increased 16% to $90.7 million from $78.5 million in the year-ago quarter.  For the six-month period, revenue increased 14% to $172.2 million, compared with $151.5 million in the prior-year six-month period.
 
For the quarter, net income increased 105% to $7.8 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, as compared with prior-year quarter net income of $3.8 million, or $0.31 per diluted share.  Net income for the six-month period was $11.5 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, compared to $6.4 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, for the prior-year six-month period.  The current-year quarter includes a $0.5 million pre-tax gain from disposition of assets, comparable to a $0.6 million pre-tax gain in the prior-year quarter from such dispositions.
 
The increase in net income for the quarter is primarily attributed to increases in net reimbursement per community-based transports, combined with decreases in maintenance expense.  For the quarter, net reimbursement per transport increased 14% from $5,559 in the prior-year quarter to $6,330 in the current-year quarter.  Maintenance expense for the current-year quarter decreased 15% or $2.2 million, as compared with the prior-year quarter, even though total flight volume increased by 1.7%.
 
Second Quarter Highlights
 
  Revenue from community-based services increased 25% to $61.9 million, while segment net income increased 93% to $14.3 million during the second quarter, as compared with net income of $7.4 million in the prior-year quarter.  The increase in segment net income was primarily attributed to the increase in reimbursement rates and decrease in maintenance expense discussed above.  Community-based transports completed during the second quarter were 9,769 as compared with 8,924 in the prior-year quarter, a 9.5% increase.  Community-based transports for bases in operation greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) decreased by 245, or 2.9%, while weather cancellations for bases in operation greater than one year increased by 85, or 5.5%, from the prior-year quarter.  The decrease in Same-Base Transports in excess of the increase in weather cancellations is attributed to shifting of transports to newly-opened bases in adjacent locations.  Excluding these adjacent locations and the effects of increased weather cancellations on remaining bases, Same-Base Transports would have increased 0.6%.
Community-Based Services:
 
  Revenue from hospital-based services increased by approximately 1% to $27.9 million, while segment net income increased from break-even results during the prior-year second quarter to net income of $1.3 million in the current quarter.  The increase in earnings is primarily attributed to a decrease in maintenance expense per flight hour from $605 in the prior-year quarter to $462 in the current-year quarter, a 24% decrease. The increase in divisional revenues from new contracts and price increases was offset by the conversion of a hospital-based services customer to the community-based service delivery model and the cessation of service under two separate contracts during the prior year.  
Hospital-Based Services:
 
Revenue, including revenue generated from internal projects, increased 51% to $6.4 million, while segment net income decreased slightly to $1.0 million from $1.1 million during the second quarter as compared with the prior-year quarter.  Growth in revenue did not correspond to growth in net income due to change in product mix.
Products Division:  
 
The Company also provided an update on July 2007 flight volume.  Total community-based transports of 3,478 during July 2007 compared with 3,282 in the prior-year month.  Same-Base Transports during the month of July decreased 176 transports, while weather cancellations for these same bases increased by 97.  While more weather cancellations affected the monthly transports, overall transports were 146 higher than the previous month of June.
 
Aaron Todd, Chief Executive Officer, stated, Our second quarter results were in line with our expectations and reflect continued strength in reimbursement, lower maintenance expense, and relatively consistent flight volume.  Days sales outstanding in receivables for community-based services decreased significantly during the quarter from 130 days as of June 30, 2006 to 106 days as of June 30, 2007, based on annualized trailing three-month revenue.  This reduction in days sales outstanding, combined with the strength of our operating results, resulted in $22.5 million net cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2007.  Long-term debt less cash decreased by $12.3 million during the same six-month period, as well.  We are obviously pleased with these results and believe that we are well on our way to achieving another year of strong growth in both top-line and bottom-line performance.
 
The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern.

ITEM 8.01.                      OTHER EVENTS
Air Methods has been informed that Aaron D. Todd, Chief Executive Officer and Director of the Company,  has established a plan to manage the exercise of certain stock options and the sale of certain shares.
The plan expires December 31, 2009, unless terminated earlier by Mr. Todd or other conditions under the plan are satisfied in advance of that date. The plan is in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934.  Rule 10b5-1 allows employees, at a time when they are not in possession of material nonpublic information, to adopt written plans to sell shares on a regular basis, regardless of any  subsequent nonpublic information they may receive, or the price of the stock at the time of the sale.
Under the plan, beginning in September 2007, Mr. Todd will exercise a certain number of stock options, periodically in 2007 and once each month in 2009, if the closing price of the Companys common stock is above a specified amount.   The options to be exercised in 2007 are currently vested.  The options to be exercised in 2009 will vest on January 1, 2009, and will expire on January 1, 2010.  Mr. Todd will be selling a fixed number of shares into the market in 2007 and each month in 2009 and using some of the sales proceeds to pay the option exercise price, and any related income tax.
Under the Plan Mr. Todd may exercise options to purchase up to 150,000 shares and sell up to 138,300 shares.  Mr. Todd currently owns 21,110 shares of common stock, vested options to acquire 41,667 shares of common stock, and unvested options to acquire 158,333 shares of common stock.
Mr. Todd has indicated that he is adopting the plan primarily in order to exercise the options that will vest on January 1, 2009 and have a one year exercise period, to gradually diversify his holdings, and to minimize the market effect of such sales by spreading them over a more extended period than the traditional trading window would allow.
This report, including the information incorporated by reference, contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The use of any of the words believe, expect, anticipates, plan, estimate, and similar expressions are intended to identify such statements. These statements are based on the Companys assumptions and estimates and are subject to risks and uncertainties. There are possible developments that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forecast or implied in the forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

Any request by an Authorized Representative of the Borrowers (or any other person designated in writing by an Authorized Representative) for a Base Rate Advance or conversion of a LIBOR Rate Advance hereunder shall be by a written Borrowing Notice or by telephone (if given by telephone, such request must be followed by a written Borrowing Notice within twenty-four (24) hours thereof) and must be given on behalf of the Borrowers so as to be received by the Agent not later than 1:00 P.M. (Denver, Colorado time) on the requested date of Advance.

General
Article VII
(C) whether the Advance is to be funded as a Base Rate Advance or a LIBOR Rate Advance, and
(D) in the case of a LIBOR Rate Advance, the initial Interest Period applicable thereto (in no event shall Borrowers request (or Agent allow) an Interest Period that extends beyond the Revolving Credit Maturity Date). The Agent may rely on any telephone request for Revolving Loans hereunder which it believes in good faith to be genuine; and the Borrowers hereby waive the right to dispute the Agent's record of the terms of such telephone request. Agent shall be entitled to honor any request for an Advance that it reasonably believes to be genuine, whether or not the Person making the request is named as an Authorized Representative hereunder or in any resolution or instruction furnished to Agent by Borrowers. The Agent shall promptly notify each other Lender of the receipt of such request, the matters specified therein, and of such Lender's ratable share of the requested Advance. With respect to each request for a LIBOR Rate Advance or a conversion of a Base Rate Advance to a LIBOR Rate Advance, Borrowers shall indemnify Lenders against any Funding Losses.

(Denver, Colorado time) on the requested date of Advance the amount of the requested Advance. If the Agent has made an Advance to the Borrowers on behalf of a Lender but has not received the amount of such Advance from such Lender by the time herein required, such Lender shall pay interest to the Agent on the amount so advanced at the overnight Federal Funds Rate from the date of such Advance to the date funds are received by the Agent from such Lender, such interest to be payable with such remittance from such Lender of the principal amount of such Advance (provided, however, that the Agent shall not make any Advance on behalf of a Lender if the Agent has received prior notice from such Lender that it will not make such Revolving Loan). If the Agent does not receive payment from such Lender by the next Business Day after the date of any Advance, the Agent shall be entitled to recover such Advance, with interest thereon at the rate then applicable to the Advance, on demand, from the Borrowers, without prejudice to the Agent's and the Borrowers' rights against any such non-advancing Lender. If such Lender pays the Agent the amount herein required with interest at the overnight Federal Funds Rate before the Agent has recovered from the Borrowers, such Lender shall be entitled to the interest payable by the Borrowers with respect to the Advance in question accruing from the date the Agent made such Advance.
Funding from Lenders

(d)           . Until the Business Day immediately prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date (or thirty (30) Business Days prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date for a LIBOR Rate Advance), Borrowers may seek a disbursement under the Revolving Facility at any time and from time to time and in any amount; provided, however, that any request for an Advance must be in the minimum principal amount of $1,000,000 and in multiples of $100,000 above the minimum principal amount.
Frequency and Amount of Borrowings
(e)           . Borrowers promise to pay to Lenders the outstanding principal of Advances under the Revolving Line of Credit in full upon the earliest to occur of (i) termination of this Agreement, (ii) acceleration of the time for payment of the Indebtedness pursuant to this Agreement, or (iii) the Revolving Credit Maturity Date. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, any amounts borrowed under the Revolving Line of Credit may be voluntarily prepaid and any amounts so prepaid may be reborrowed, up to the amount available under Section 2.1(b) above at the time of such borrowing, until the Business Day immediately prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date (or thirty (30) Business Days prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date for a LIBOR Rate Advance). Borrowers shall notify Lender by 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day preceding the Business Day (or three (3) Business Days preceding such date for a LIBOR Rate Advance) of any prepayment of any amounts under the Revolving Line of Credit.
Repayment of Principal
15
(f)           . During the term of the Revolving Facility, Borrowers shall pay to Agent such amounts as are necessary so that the sum of the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Credit Outstandings and the Letter of Credit Outstandings in the aggregate at any time does not exceed the Total Revolving Credit Commitment at such time. Borrowers shall pay such amounts within two (2) Business Days after the earlier of demand by Agent and the date Borrower learns of any such excess.
Overadvances
(g)           . If no Borrowing Notice has been submitted to Agent not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the end of any Interest Period on a LIBOR Rate Advance (which shall set forth the new Interest Period or state that the LIBOR Rate Advance is being converted to a Base Rate Advance), the LIBOR Rate Advance then maturing shall be automatically continued at the then current LIBOR Rate for an additional Interest Period equal to the expired Interest Period; provided, however, that if the Revolving Credit Maturity Date would fall within such subsequent Interest Period or such Interest Period is not available for any other reason, the LIBOR Rate Advance then maturing shall be automatically converted to a Base Rate Advance. At any time at least thirty (30) days prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, Borrowers may request to convert a Base Rate Advance to a LIBOR Rate Advance upon submission of a Borrowing Notice to Agent at least three (3) Business Days prior to the effectiveness of such conversion.
Continuation and Conversion of Interest Rate
(h)           . The Borrowers shall, by notice from an Authorized Representative, have the right from time to time upon not less than three (3) Business Days' written notice to the Agent, effective upon receipt, to reduce the Total Revolving Credit Commitment. The Agent shall give each Lender, within one (1) Business Day of receipt of such notice, telefacsimile notice or telephonic notice (confirmed in writing) of such reduction. Each such reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of the lesser of (x) at least $1,000,000 or (y) the entire remaining Total Revolving Credit Commitment, and shall permanently reduce the Total Revolving Credit Commitment. Each reduction of the Total Revolving Credit Commitment shall be accompanied by payment to the extent that the principal amount of Revolving Credit Outstandings plus Letter of Credit Outstandings exceeds the Total Revolving Credit Commitment as reduced under this Section 2.1(h).
Reductions
(a)           . Subject to the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the First Closing Date, the Lenders agree to loan to Borrowers an aggregate amount equal to the Pre-Acquisition Term Loan Amount, which shall be evidenced by promissory notes in favor of each Lender in the form of ("Term Note"). Upon consummation of the Acquisition Agreement and subject to the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Second Closing Date, the Lenders agree to loan to Borrowers an aggregate amount equal to the Acquisition Term Loan Amount, which shall be evidenced by Term Notes in favor of each Lender. In the event the conditions to funding the Acquisition Term Loan Amount are not met prior to December 31, 2007, the Lenders obligation to fund the Acquisition Term Loan Amount shall terminate and the Term Loan shall consist only of the Pre-Acquisition Term Loan Amount. No amounts repaid by Borrowers under the Term Loan may be reborrowed.
Amount
Exhibit C
16
(b)           . Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each
Commitment
Lender severally agrees to participate on a pro rata basis as to each Term Loan determined by
such Lender's Applicable Commitment Percentage.
(i)           . Borrowers promise to pay to Lenders the outstanding principal of the Term Loan as follows: (A) until the Term Loan Maturity Date, quarterly payments in the amount of, if the Second Closing Date occurs, $1,785,000.00 and, if the Second Closing Date does not occur, $892,500.00, which payments shall be due and payable on the last Business Day of each Fiscal Quarter with the first such payment being due on June 30, 2008, and (B) in full upon the earliest to occur of (1) termination of this Agreement, (2) acceleration of the time for payment of the Indebtedness pursuant to this Agreement or (3) the Term Loan Maturity Date. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, any amounts outstanding under the Term Loan may be voluntarily prepaid. Borrowers shall notify Agent by 1:00 P.M. (Denver, Colorado time) on the Business Day prior to the Business Day for such prepayment of any prepayment of any portion of the Term Loan.
Repayment of Principal
(ii)           . No later than 180 days after the receipt of net proceeds from the sale or other disposition of any assets of a Borrower constituting Collateral (other than sale of inventory in the ordinary course of business), the Borrowers shall prepay the Term Loan in the inverse order of the maturity thereof in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of the net proceeds that remain after deducting any amount reinvested in replacement assets within 180 days after receipt of such net proceeds. For purposes of this section, "net proceeds" shall mean all proceeds received from the disposition of such assets less any applicable taxes and reasonable costs of such disposition.
Mandatory Prepayments
(c)           . On each of the First Closing Date and the Second Closing Date, Borrowers shall choose to have the Term Loan accrue interest as a Base Rate Loan or a LIBOR Rate Loan (which, if chosen, also requires Borrowers to choose an Interest Period). In the case of the LIBOR Rate Loan, upon the expiration of an Interest Period, in the absence of a new Interest Period Notice submitted to Agent not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the end of such Interest Period (which shall set forth the new Interest Period or state that the LIBOR Rate Loan is being converted to a Base Rate Loan), the LIBOR Rate Loan then maturing shall be automatically continued at the then current LIBOR Rate for an additional Interest Period equal to the expired Interest Period; provided, however, that if the Term Loan Maturity Date would fall within such subsequent Interest Period, the LIBOR Rate Loan then maturing shall be automatically converted to a Base Rate Loan. At any time prior to the Term Loan Maturity Date, Borrowers may request to convert a Base Rate Loan to a LIBOR Rate Loan upon submission of a LIBOR Rate Notice to Agent at least three (3) Business Days prior to the effectiveness of such conversion.
Interest Option
17
As part of the Revolving Facility, Borrowers may, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, request Letters of Credit to be issued in an amount not to exceed the Total Letter of Credit Commitment and in the event and to the extent the Issuing Bank issues a Letter of Credit on behalf of a Borrower, the Total Revolving Credit Commitment shall be considered utilized by the amount of such Letter of Credit. Amounts drawn under any Letter of Credit and honored by the Issuing Bank shall become an Advance hereunder in such amount, at such time and subject to the terms of this Agreement, whether or not any Event of Default has occurred. All Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement shall reduce the amount available under the Total Revolving Credit Commitment. At no time shall the aggregate amount of Letter of Credit Outstandings exceed the Total Letter of Credit Commitment; provided, however, that upon expiration or termination of any Letter of Credit, the Total Letter of Credit Outstandings shall be reduced and the Issuing Bank may determine to issue, or cause to be issued, additional Letters of Credit provided that, in connection with any such additional Letter of Credit, the Total Letter of Credit Commitment shall not be exceeded and the other terms and conditions set forth herein have been satisfied. The Issuing Bank shall not be obligated to issue Letters of Credit with an expiration date that extends beyond the earlier of (a) 364 days after the date of issuance for standby letters of credit or 180 days after the date of issuance for trade and commercial letters of credit, and (b) fifteen (15) days prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date. All of the Issuing Bank's terms and conditions for the issuance of a Letter of Credit must also be complied with by Borrowers prior to any such issuance.
Borrowers hereby expressly agree that Borrowers' obligations relating to any Letter of Credit are secured by the Collateral.
(a)           . Borrowers agree to pay interest on the Revolving Credit Outstandings and the Term Loans from time to time as provided herein. The unpaid principal balance of each Base Rate Advance and of each Base Rate Loan will bear interest at an annual rate equal to the Base Rate. The unpaid principal balance of each LIBOR Rate Advance and of each LIBOR Rate Loan will bear interest at an annual rate equal to the LIBOR Rate.
Interest

Interest Payments
(i)           . Interest on Base Rate Advances shall be due and payable monthly in arrears on the last Business Day of each month. Interest on LIBOR Rate Advances shall be due and payable in arrears at the end of the applicable Interest Period but, in any event, no less than every ninety (90) days.

(c)           . Notwithstanding the rates of interest specified in Sections 4.1(a) and 4.1(b) and the payment dates specified herein, effective immediately upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, the principal balance, and accrued interest thereon as of such date, of all outstanding Revolving Loans and the Term Loans shall to the extent permitted by applicable law bear interest payable at the Default Rate. In addition, all other amounts due Agent or the Lenders (whether directly or for reimbursement) under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, if not paid when due or, in the event no time period is expressed, if not paid within five (5) days after written notice from Agent that the same has become due, shall thereafter bear interest at the Default Rate. Finally, any amount due (i) on the Revolving Facility on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date that is not then paid and (ii) on the Term Loans on the Term Loan Maturity Date that are not then paid shall also bear interest thereafter at the Default Rate.
Default Interest
(d)           . Borrowers shall have the right to enter into fixed rate interest rate swaps with any Lender or any other financial institution. Any obligations of a Borrower to a Lender under an interest rate swap shall be Indebtedness and secured by the security interest granted in .
Interest Rate Swaps
Article V
(a)           . For the period beginning on the First Closing Date and ending on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, the Borrowers agree to pay to the Agent, for the pro rata benefit of the Lenders, based on their Applicable Commitment Percentages, a commitment fee in the amount of the Applicable Margin on the average daily unused portion of the Revolving Line of Credit. Usage on the Revolving Line of Credit will equal the sum of Revolving Credit Outstandings and Letter of Credit Outstandings. Such fees shall be due and payable monthly in arrears on the first day of each month beginning on the first day of the first month following the First Closing Date and shall be based on the unused commitments for the immediately preceding month.
Commitment Fee
(b)           . The Borrowers shall pay to the Agent, for the pro rata benefit of the Lenders based on their Applicable Commitment Percentages, a fee equal to the Applicable Margin for LIBOR Rate Advances per annum on the aggregate amount of Letter of Credit Outstandings. Such fee shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each Fiscal Quarter, the first such payment to be made on the first such date occurring after the date of the issuance of a Letter of Credit.
Letter of Credit Fees
(c)           . Borrowers agree to pay Agent a fee equal to 0.125% per annum of the face amount of each Letter of Credit requested by Borrowers, if any. Such fee shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each Fiscal Quarter, the first such payment to be made on the first such date occurring after the date of the issuance of a Letter of Credit. Borrowers also agree to pay all present and

Borrowers shall pay to the Agent for the account of each Lender, based on its Applicable Commitment Percentage, a commitment fee equal to 0.75% per annum times $25,000,000 for the period between the First Closing Date and the earliest to occur of (i) the termination of the Lenders' obligation to fund the Acquisition Term Loan Amount, and (ii) the Second Closing Date. This fee shall accrue at all times during this period, and shall be due and payable monthly in arrears on the last Business Day of each month, commencing with the first such date to occur after the First Closing Date.
Delayed Draw Fees
(e)           . The fees described in this Section 4.2 represent compensation for services rendered and to be rendered separate and apart from the lending of money or the provision of credit and do not constitute compensation for the use, detention or forbearance of money. The obligation of Borrowers to pay the fees described herein shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, the obligation of Borrowers to pay interest, other fees and expenses otherwise described in this Agreement or in any other agreement with the Agent. All fees shall be payable when due at Agent's office in Colorado in immediately available funds and shall be non-refundable when paid. Such fees shall constitute part of the Facility, secured by all of the Collateral.
Payment of Fees
Interest and fees shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in the period during which interest or fees accrue and a year of three hundred sixty (360) days. Notwithstanding any of the terms and conditions contained in this section, interest in respect of the Revolving Credit Outstandings, Letter of Credit Outstandings and the Term Loan shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.
No Lender shall be responsible for any default of any other Lender in respect to such other Lender's obligation to make any Advance hereunder or to fund its purchase of any Participation hereunder nor shall the Applicable Commitment Percentage, the Revolving Credit Commitment or Letter of Credit Commitment of any Lender hereunder be increased as a result of such default of any other Lender. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event any Lender shall fail to advance funds to the Borrowers as herein provided, the Agent may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, advance under the applicable Revolving Note in its favor as a Lender all or any portion of such amount or amounts (each, a "Deficiency Advance") and shall thereafter be entitled to payments of principal of and interest on such Deficiency Advance in the same manner and at the same interest rate or rates to which such other Lender would have been entitled had it made such Advance under its Revolving Note; provided that (a) such defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive payments of principal, interest or fees with respect to such Deficiency Advance until the amount of such Deficiency Advance (together with interest thereon as provided in clause (b)) shall be paid by such Lender to the Agent, and (b) upon payment to the Agent from such other Lender of the entire outstanding amount of each such Deficiency Advance, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate, then such payment shall be credited against the applicable Revolving Note of the Agent in full payment of such Deficiency Advance and such Borrower shall be deemed to have borrowed the amount of such Deficiency Advance from such other Lender as of the most recent date or dates, as the case may be, upon which any payments of interest were made by such Borrower thereon. In the event any Lender shall fail to fund its purchase of a Participation after notice from the Issuing Bank such Lender shall pay to the Issuing Bank such amount on demand, together with interest at the Federal Funds Rate on the amount so due from the date of such notice to the date such purchase price is received by the Issuing Bank.
20
(a)           . If, on or before any date when a LIBOR Rate is to be determined, Agent determines that the basis for determining the LIBOR Rate is not available or that the resulting rate does not accurately reflect the cost to Lenders of making or converting Advances or Term Loans at that rate for the applicable Interest Period, then Agent shall promptly notify, in writing, Borrowers and Lenders of that determination (which is conclusive and binding on Borrowers absent manifest error) and the applicable Advance or Term Loan shall bear interest at the Base Rate. Until Agent notifies Borrowers that those circumstances no longer exist, Lenders' commitments under this Agreement to make, or to convert to, LIBOR Rate Advances and LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended.
Basis Unavailable or Inadequate for LIBOR
(i)           With respect to any LIBOR Rate Advance or LIBOR Rate Loan, if
(A) any present or future law imposes, modifies, or deems applicable (or if compliance by any Lender with any requirement of any court or authority results in) any reserve requirement, and if
(B) those reserves reduce any sums receivable by Lenders under this Agreement or increase the costs incurred by Lenders in advancing or maintaining any portion of any LIBOR Rate Advance or LIBOR Rate Loan, then (C) Lenders (through Agent) shall deliver to Borrowers a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the amount necessary to compensate it for its reduction or increase, as the case may be (which certificate is conclusive and binding absent manifest error), and (D) Borrowers shall promptly pay that amount to Agent upon demand. This paragraph shall survive the satisfaction and payment of all Indebtedness and termination of this Agreement. This paragraph may be invoked by Lenders only if Lenders are generally invoking similar provisions against other Persons to which Lenders lend funds pursuant to facilities similar to the Facility.
(ii)           With respect to the Term Loan or the Revolving Line of Credit, if any present or future law regarding capital adequacy or compliance by any Lender with any request, directive or requirement now existing or hereafter imposed by any court or authority regarding capital adequacy, or any change in its written policies or in the risk category of this transaction, reduces the rate of return on its capital as a consequence of its obligations under this Agreement to a level below that which it otherwise could have achieved (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by it to be material (and it may, in determining the amount, utilize reasonable assumptions and allocations of costs and expenses and use any reasonable averaging or attribution method), then (unless the effect is already reflected in the rate of interest then applicable under this Agreement) Agent shall notify Borrowers and deliver to Borrowers a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the amount necessary to compensate it (which certificate is conclusive and binding absent manifest error), and Borrowers shall promptly pay that amount to Agent upon demand. This paragraph shall survive the satisfaction and payment of all Indebtedness and termination of this Agreement. This paragraph may be invoked by Lenders only if Lenders are generally invoking similar provisions against other Persons to which Lenders lend funds pursuant to facilities similar to the Facility.
21
(c)           . If any law makes it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Advances or LIBOR Rate Loans, then that Lender shall promptly notify Borrowers and Agent, and (i) as to undisbursed funds, that requested Advance shall be made as a Base Rate Advance, (ii) as to any outstanding LIBOR Rate Loan or LIBOR Rate Advance, (A) if maintaining the LIBOR Rate Loan or LIBOR Rate Advance until the last day of the applicable Interest Period is unlawful, the LIBOR Rate Loan or LIBOR Rate Advance shall be converted to a Base Rate Loan or Base Rate Advance as of the date of notice, and Borrowers shall pay any related Funding Loss, or (B) if not prohibited by law, the LIBOR Rate Loan or LIBOR Rate Advance shall be converted to a Base Rate Loan or Base Rate Advance as of the last day of the applicable Interest Period, or (C) if any conversion will not resolve the unlawfulness, Borrowers shall promptly pay the LIBOR Rate Loan or LIBOR Rate Advance, without penalty, together with any related Funding Loss. This paragraph may be invoked by Lenders only if Lenders are generally invoking similar provisions against other Persons to which Lenders lend funds pursuant to facilities similar to the Facility.
Change in Law
Borrowers agree to indemnify each Lender against, and pay to it upon demand, any Funding Loss of that Lender. When any Lender demands that Borrowers pay any Funding Loss, that Lender shall deliver to Borrowers and Agent a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for imposing a Funding Loss and the calculation of the amount, which calculation is conclusive and binding absent manifest error. The provisions of and undertakings and indemnification set forth in this paragraph shall survive the satisfaction and payment of the Indebtedness and termination of this Agreement.
Borrowers agree that each monthly or other statement of account mailed or delivered by Agent to Borrowers pertaining to the outstanding balance of Advances or Letters of Credit under the Revolving Line of Credit, the outstanding balance of the Term Loan, the amount of interest due thereon, fees, and costs and expenses shall be final, conclusive, and binding on Borrowers and shall constitute an "account stated" with respect to the matters contained therein unless, within sixty (60) calendar days after such statement is mailed or, if not mailed, delivered to Borrowers, Borrowers shall deliver to Agent written notice of any objections which they may have as to such statement of account, and in such event, only the items to which objection is expressly made in such notice shall be considered to be disputed by Borrowers.

No modification, rescission, waiver, release, or amendment of any provision of this Agreement shall be made, except by a written agreement signed by Borrowers and the Required Lenders (except as otherwise provided in Section 13.2).
This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and by Lenders and Borrowers on separate counterparts, each of which, when so executed and delivered, shall be an original, but all of which shall together constitute one and the same Agreement. A counterpart hereof executed and delivered by facsimile shall be effective as an original for all applicable purposes.
Any financial calculation to be made, all financial statements and other financial information to be provided, and all books and records to be kept in connection with the provisions of this Agreement, shall be in accordance with GAAP; provided, however, that in the event changes in GAAP after the First Closing Date shall be mandated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or any similar accounting body of comparable standing, or should be recommended by Borrowers' certified public accountants, to the extent such changes would affect any financial calculations to be made in connection herewith, such changes shall be implemented in making such calculations only from and after such date as Borrowers and Lenders shall have amended this Agreement to the extent necessary to reflect such changes in the financial and other covenants to which such calculations relate.
(a) If after receipt of any payment of all, or any part of, the Indebtedness, Lenders are, for any reason, compelled to surrender such payment to any Person because such payment is determined to be void or voidable as a preference, an impermissible setoff, or a diversion of trust funds, or for any other reason, the Transaction Documents shall continue in full force and Borrowers shall be liable, and shall indemnify and hold Lenders harmless for, the amount of such payment surrendered. The provisions of this section shall be and remain effective notwithstanding any contrary action which may have been taken by Lenders in reliance upon such payment, and any such contrary action so taken shall be without prejudice to Lenders' rights under the Transaction Documents and shall be deemed to have been conditioned upon such payment having become final and irrevocable. The provisions of this Section 13.8(a) shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents.
   
 
51
(b)           Borrowers agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Lenders from and against any and all liabilities, claims, damages, penalties, expenditures, losses, or charges, including, but not limited to, all costs of investigation, monitoring, legal representations, remedial response, removal, restoration, or permit acquisition, which may now, or in the future, be undertaken, suffered, paid, awarded, assessed, or otherwise incurred by Lenders as a result of the presence of, Release of, or threatened Release of Hazardous Substances on, in, under, or near the property owned, leased or operated by any Borrower or any Consolidated Subsidiary. The liability of Borrowers under the covenants of this Section 13.8(b) is not limited by any exculpatory provisions in this Agreement or any other documents securing the Indebtedness and shall survive repayment of the Indebtedness or any transfer or termination of this Agreement regardless of the means of such transfer or termination. Borrowers agree that Lenders shall not be liable to Borrowers or any Consolidated Subsidiary for the completeness or accuracy of any Environmental Report or the information contained therein. Borrowers further agree that Lenders have no duty to warn Borrowers about any actual or potential environmental contamination or other problem that may have become apparent, or will become apparent, to Lenders. The provisions of this Section 13.8(b) shall survive repayment of the Indebtedness.
 
(c)           Borrowers agree to pay, indemnify, and hold Lenders harmless from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses, or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, counsel and special counsel fees and disbursements in connection with any litigation, investigation, hearing, or other proceeding) with respect, or in any way related, to the existence, execution, delivery, enforcement, performance, and administration of this Agreement and any other Transaction Document (collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"), except to the extent that any of the foregoing arises out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party being indemnified. The provisions of this Section 13.8(c) shall survive repayment of the Indebtedness.
 
 
This Agreement is, and is intended to be, a continuing Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect until the full and final payment of all of the Indebtedness in immediately available funds. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Borrowers may terminate this Agreement at any time by giving Lenders a written notice of termination within the time periods required in Sections 2.2(b)(i) and 2.1(h), upon the expiration of which time periods all outstanding Indebtedness shall be due and payable in full without presentation, demand, or further notice of any kind, whether or not all or any part of such Indebtedness is otherwise due and payable pursuant to the agreement or instrument evidencing same. Lenders may terminate this Agreement immediately and without notice upon the occurrence of an Event of Default. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement or elsewhere to the contrary, the Security Interest, Lenders' rights and remedies under the Transaction Documents and Borrowers' obligations and liabilities under the Transaction Documents, shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect until all of the Indebtedness outstanding, or contracted or committed for (whether or not outstanding), together with interest accruing thereon after such notice, shall be finally and irrevocably paid in full. No Collateral shall be released or financing statement terminated until such final and irrevocable payment in full of the Indebtedness in immediately available funds. Thereafter, Lenders shall (at Borrowers' expense) release or terminate all security interests, liens and encumbrances held by Agent on the Collateral.
52
 
 
From time to time, Borrowers shall take such action and execute and deliver to Lenders such additional documents, instruments, certificates, and agreements as Lenders may reasonably request to effectuate the purposes of the Transaction Documents.
 
 
Article and Section headings used in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction of this Agreement.
 
 
The execution and delivery of this Agreement shall in no manner impair or affect any other security (by endorsement or otherwise) for payment or performance of the Indebtedness, and no security taken hereafter as security for payment or performance of the Indebtedness shall impair in any manner or affect this Agreement, or the Security Interest granted hereby, all such present and future additional security to be considered as cumulative security.
 
 
Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement: (a) the powers conferred on Agent or Lenders hereunder are solely to protect their interests and shall not impose any duty to exercise any such powers; and (b) except as may be required by applicable law, neither Agent nor Lenders shall have any duty as to any Collateral or as to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties or any other rights pertaining to any Collateral.

The provisions of this Agreement are independent of, and separable from, each other, and no such provision shall be affected or rendered invalid or unenforceable by virtue of the fact that
for any reason any other such provision may be invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part. If
any provision of this Agreement is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such provision shall be ineffective in such jurisdiction only to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability, and such prohibition or unenforceability shall not invalidate the balance of such
provision to the extent it is not prohibited or unenforceable nor render prohibited or
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
53
 
 
The terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents shall be cumulative except to the extent that they are specifically inconsistent with each other, in which case the terms of this Agreement shall prevail.
 
 
This Agreement, the Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference, and the other Transaction Documents constitute the entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and supersede all prior negotiations, understandings, and agreements between such parties with respect to such transactions, including, without limitation, those expressed in any commitment letter delivered by Lenders to Borrowers.
 
 
This Agreement, and the transactions evidenced hereby, shall be governed by, and construed under, the internal laws of the State of Colorado, without regard to principles of conflicts of law, as the same may from time to time be in effect, including, without limitation, the UCC.
 
 
Borrowers and Lenders agree that any action or proceeding to enforce, or arising out of, the Transaction Documents maybe commenced in any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Colorado, and Borrowers and Lenders waive personal service of process and agree that a summons and complaint commencing an action or proceeding in any such court shall be properly served and shall confer personal jurisdiction if served by registered or certified mail to Borrowers or Lenders, as appropriate, or as otherwise provided by the laws of the State or the United States.
 
 
BORROWERS AND LENDERS HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY, AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY BORROWERS OR LENDERS MAY HAVE IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING, IN LAW OR IN EQUITY, IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED THERETO. BORROWERS REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OR AGENT OF LENDERS HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT LENDERS WILL NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THIS RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL WAIVER. BORROWERS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT LENDERS HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 13.20.
54
 
 
Oral agreements or commitments to loan money, extend credit or to forbear from enforcing repayment of a debt, including promises to extend or renew such debt, are not enforceable. To protect Borrowers and Lenders from misunderstanding or disappointment, any agreements covering such matters are contained in the Transaction Documents, which are the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the parties hereto.
 
Each of the Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential); (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority; (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process; (d) to any other party to this Agreement; (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder; (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this section, to (i) any permitted assignee of or participant in any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, or (ii) any direct or indirect contractual counterparty or prospective counterparty (or such contractual counterparty's or prospective counterparty's professional advisor) to any credit derivative transaction relating to obligations of the Borrowers; (g) with the consent of the Borrowers; (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this section, or (ii) becomes available to the Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrowers; or (i) if the applicable Lender is an insurance company, to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any other similar organization to the extent requested in connection with a review of such Lender. In addition, the Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement (but not about the Borrowers) to market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry, and service providers to the Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration and management of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. For the purposes of this section, "Information" means all information received from Borrowers or any Consolidated Subsidiary relating to Borrowers or any Consolidated Subsidiary or its respective business, other than any such information that is available to Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by Borrowers or any Consolidated Subsidiary. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.

13.23       .
USA PATRIOT ACT NOTICE
 
Each Lender that is subject to the Act (as hereinafter defined) and the Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into Law October 26, 2001)) (the "Act"), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrowers, which information includes the name and address of the Borrowers and other information that will allow such Lender or the Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrowers in accordance with the Act.
 
13.24       
JOINT AND SEVERAL OBLIGATIONS.
 
(a)           Each Borrower agrees that its obligations and liabilities (including the Indebtedness) under this Agreement and all other Transaction Documents are joint and several obligations regardless of which Borrower receives the proceeds of the Transactions or the manner in which the Borrowers, the Agent or the Lenders account therefor in their respective records. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that, for purposes of the Transaction Documents, the Borrowers constitute a single integrated financial enterprise and that each receives a benefit from the availability of credit under this Agreement to each other Borrower.
 
(b)           Each Borrower acknowledges that it will enjoy significant benefits from the business conducted by the other Borrowers because of, their combined ability to bargain with other Persons including without limitation, their ability to receive the credit extensions under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, which would not have been available to an individual Borrower acting alone. Each Borrower has determined that it is in its best interest to procure the credit facilities contemplated hereunder, with the credit support of the other Borrowers as contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.
inter alia,
 
(c)           The Agent and the Lenders have advised the Borrowers that they are unwilling to enter into this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and make available the credit facilities extended hereby or thereby to a Borrower unless the other Borrowers agree, among other things, to be jointly and severally liable for the due and proper payment of the Indebtedness of the other Borrowers under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. Each Borrower has determined that it is in its best interest and in pursuit of its purposes that it so induce the Agent and the Lenders to extend credit pursuant to this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents (i) because of the desirability to each Borrower of the credit facilities hereunder and the interest rates and the modes of borrowing available hereunder; (ii) because a Borrower may engage in transactions jointly with other Borrowers; and (iii) because a Borrower may require, from time to time, access to funds under this Agreement for the purposes herein set forth. Each Borrower, individually, expressly understands, agrees and acknowledges, that the credit facilities contemplated hereunder would not be made available on the terms herein in the absence of the collective credit of the Borrowers and the joint and several liability of all such Persons. Accordingly, each Borrower individually acknowledges that the benefit of the accommodations made under this Agreement to the Borrowers as a whole constitutes reasonably equivalent value, regardless of the amount of the indebtedness actually borrowed by, advanced to, or the amount of credit provided to, any individual Borrower.
56
(d)           Notwithstanding anything herein, in the Notes or in any other Transaction Document to the contrary, in any action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state or federal bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if, as a result of applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, including Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or any applicable provisions of comparable state law (collectively, "Fraudulent Transfer Laws"), the obligations of a Borrower under this Agreement, the Notes or any other Transaction Document would, after giving effect to (i) all other liabilities of such Borrower, contingent or otherwise, that are relevant under such Fraudulent Transfer Laws (specifically excluding, however, any liabilities of such Borrower in respect of intercompany Debt to another Borrower); and (ii) the value as assets of such Borrower (as determined under the applicable provisions of such Fraudulent Transfer Laws) and of any rights of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar rights held by such Borrower, be held or determined to be void, invalid or unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account of the amount of its liability under this Agreement, the Notes or any other Transaction Document, then the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by such Borrower, any Lender, the Agent or any other Person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and enforceable and not subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined in such action or proceeding.
 
(e)           Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, the Agent is hereby authorized, without notice or demand and without affecting the liability of any Borrower hereunder, to, at any time and from time to time, (i) renew, extend or otherwise increase the time for payment of the Indebtedness; (ii) with the written agreement of Borrowers, accelerate or otherwise change the terms relating to the Indebtedness or otherwise modify, amend or change the terms of any promissory note or other agreement, document or instrument now or hereafter executed by any Borrower and delivered to Agent; (iii) accept partial payments of the Indebtedness; (iv) take and hold security or collateral for the payment of the Indebtedness or for the payment of any guaranties of the Indebtedness and exchange, enforce, waive and release any such security or collateral; (v) apply such security or collateral and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as Agent, in its sole discretion, may determine; (vi) settle, release, compromise, collect or otherwise liquidate the Indebtedness and any security or collateral therefor in any manner; and (vii) exercise, in its sole discretion, any right, remedy or combination thereof that may then be available to Agent, without affecting or impairing the Indebtedness of any Borrower. Except as specifically provided in this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, Agent shall have the exclusive right to determine the time and manner of application of any payments or credits, whether received from any Borrower or any other source, and such determination shall be binding on all Borrowers. All such payments and credits may be applied, reversed and reapplied, in whole or in part, to any of the Indebtedness as Agent shall determine in its sole discretion without affecting the validity or enforceability of the Indebtedness of any other Borrower.
(f)           Each Borrower hereby agrees that, except as hereinafter provided, its liability with respect to the Indebtedness hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of (i) the absence of any attempt to collect the Indebtedness from any obligor or other action to enforce the same; (ii) the waiver or consent by Agent with respect to any provision of any instrument evidencing the Indebtedness, or any part thereof, or any other agreement heretofore, now or hereafter executed by a Borrower (other than the Borrower with respect to which such waiver or consent is granted) and delivered to Agent; (iii) the failure by Agent to take any steps to perfect and maintain its security interest in, or to preserve its rights to, any security or collateral for the Indebtedness; (iv) the institution of any proceeding under the United States Bankruptcy Code, or any similar proceeding, by or against a Borrower or Agent's election in any such proceeding of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the United States Bankruptcy Code; (v) any borrowing or grant of a security interest by a Borrower as debtor-in-possession, under Section 364 of the United States Bankruptcy Code; (vi) the disallowance, under Section 502 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, of all or any portion of Agent's claim(s) for repayment of any of the Indebtedness; or (vii) any other circumstance other than payment in full of the Indebtedness which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor or surety.
57
 
(g)           Each Borrower hereby waives (i) any right of redemption with respect to the Collateral after the sale hereunder, and all rights, if any, of marshalling of the Collateral or other collateral or security for the Indebtedness; and (ii) any right (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require the Agent or any Lender to (A) proceed against any other Borrower or any other Person, (B) proceed against or exhaust any other collateral or security for any of the Indebtedness, or (C) pursue any remedy in the Agent's or any Lender's power whatsoever. Each Borrower hereby waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any other Borrower or any other Person other than payment in full of the Indebtedness, including, without limitation, any defense based on or arising out of the disability of any other Borrower or any other Person, or the unenforceability of the Indebtedness or any part thereof for any reason, or the cessation for any reason of the liability of any other Borrower other than payment in full of the Indebtedness. The Agent may, at its election, foreclose on any security held by the Agent by one or more judicial or non-judicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by applicable law), or exercise any other right or remedy the Agent may have against any other Borrower or any other Person, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Borrower hereunder except to the extent the Indebtedness has been paid in full. Each Borrower waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the Agent, even though that election of remedies, such as non-judicial foreclosure with respect to security for a guaranteed obligation, has destroyed such Borrower's rights of subrogation and reimbursement against any other Borrower.
 
(h)          Until all Indebtedness has been paid and satisfied in full and all Revolving Credit Commitments hereunder are terminated, no payment made by or for the account of a Borrower including, without limitation, (i) a payment made by such Borrower on behalf of the liabilities of any other Borrower; or (ii) a payment by any other person under any guaranty, shall entitle such Borrower, by subrogation or otherwise, to any payment from any other Borrower or from or out of any other Borrower's property and such Borrower shall not exercise any right or remedy against any other Borrower or any property of any other Borrower by reason of any performance of such Borrower of its joint and several liability hereunder.
 
(i)          Any notice given by one Borrower hereunder shall constitute and be deemed to be notice given by all Borrowers, jointly and severally. Notice given by Agent or Lenders to AMC hereunder or pursuant to any other Transaction Documents in accordance with the terms hereof shall constitute notice to each and every Borrower. The knowledge of one Borrower shall be imputed to all Borrowers and any consent by one Borrower shall constitute the consent of and shall bind all Borrowers.
58
 
(j)          This Section 13.24 is intended to define the relative rights of Borrowers and nothing set forth in this section is intended to or shall impair the Indebtedness of Borrowers, jointly and severally, to pay any amounts as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents. Nothing contained in this section shall limit the liability of any Borrower to pay the credit facilities made directly or indirectly to that Borrower and accrued interest, fees and expenses with respect thereto or for which such Borrower shall be primarily liable.
 
(k)          The parties hereto acknowledge that any rights of contribution and indemnification of a Borrower against another Borrower shall constitute assets of each Borrower to which such contribution and indemnification is owing. The rights of any indemnifying Borrower against the other Borrowers shall be exercisable upon the full and indefeasible payment of the Indebtedness and the termination of the credit facilities hereunder.
 
(1)          This Agreement is a primary and original obligation of each of the Borrowers and each of the Borrowers shall be liable for all existing and future Indebtedness of any other Borrower as fully as if such Indebtedness were directly incurred by such Borrower.
 
(m)          Each Borrower further agrees that its Indebtedness hereunder shall not be impaired in any manner whatsoever by any bankruptcy, extensions, moratoria or other relief granted to any other Borrower pursuant to any statute presently in force or hereafter enacted.
 
59
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first above written.

Exhibit 10.2
This GUARANTY AND SECURITY AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of October 1, 2007, is by and between [CJ CRITICAL CARE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS OF FLORIDA, INC., a Pennsylvania corporation] [CJ CRITICAL CARE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, INC., a Pennsylvania corporation] [CJ CRITICAL CARE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS OF KENTUCKY, INC., a Pennsylvania corporation] [SPECIAL JET SERVICES, INC., a Pennsylvania corporation] ("Guarantor") and KEYBANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, as a Lender and as Agent for all the Lenders under the Credit Agreement ("Agent").
WHEREAS, FSS Airholdings, Inc. and CJ Systems Aviation Group, Inc. (each a "Borrower"), are each becoming a Borrower under that certain Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement dated as of September 17, 2007 by and among Air Methods Corporation, Rocky Mountain Holdings, L.L.C., Mercy Air Service, Inc., and LifeNet, Inc., as the initial Borrowers, the Agent, and the Lenders (as defined therein) (as amended or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"), pursuant to which the Lenders have agreed to make certain financial accommodations available to the Borrowers (capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined, shall have the meanings given them in the Credit Agreement); and
WHEREAS, Guarantor, as an affiliate of the Borrowers, will benefit from the making of the financial accommodations pursuant to the Credit Agreement and is willing to guaranty the Liabilities (as defined below) on the terms hereinafter set forth, and to secure such guaranties by a pledge of their assets, as an inducement to the Lenders to enter into the Credit Agreement and make the loans to the Borrowers as set forth therein.
NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
(a)           Guarantor hereby unconditionally, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, guarantees the full and prompt payment when due, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of all obligations (monetary or otherwise) of the Borrowers to the Lenders, howsoever created, arising or evidenced, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, now or hereafter existing, or due or to become due that arise out of or in connection with the Credit Agreement, the Notes (as defined in the Credit Agreement), any other Transaction Document (as defined in the Credit Agreement), in each case as the same may be amended, modified, extended or renewed from time to time (all such obligations being herein collectively called the "Liabilities"); provided, however, that Guarantor shall be liable under this Agreement for the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering this Agreement, as it relates to Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount..
(b)           Guarantor agrees that, in the event of the occurrence of any Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and a declaration of acceleration under Section 10.2 of the Credit Agreement, Guarantor will pay to the Lenders forthwith the full amount that would be payable hereunder by Guarantor if all Liabilities were then due and payable.  No payment made upon the Liabilities will discharge or diminish the continuing liability of Guarantor in connection with any additional Liabilities.
 
 
 
Guarantor hereby assigns, mortgages, charges, hypothecates and pledges to the Lenders, and grants to the Lenders a security interest in all Guarantor's right, title and interest in and to the following (collectively, the "Collateral"):
(a)           All Accounts (other than governmental Accounts that are not legally assignable by Guarantor), Inventory, general intangibles, chattel paper, documents, and instruments, whether or not specifically assigned to a Lender, automotive equipment, machinery, motor vehicles, furniture and fixtures.
(b)           All guaranties, collateral, liens on, or security interests in, real or personal property, leases, letter of credit rights and other rights, agreements, and property securing or relating to payment of accounts.
(c)           All rights to receive the surplus funds, if any, which are payable to Guarantor following the termination of any pension plan and the satisfaction of all liabilities or participants and beneficiaries under such pension plan in accordance with applicable law.
(d)           All trademarks, trademark rights, patents, patent rights, intellectual property licenses and permits, trade names, trade name rights, and approvals, together with all income, royalties, damages and payments now and hereafter due and payable thereunder with respect thereto including, but not limited to, those set forth on .
Schedule A
(e)           Equipment, whether or not affixed to realty, including Unencumbered Aircraft and equipment located thereon but excluding any Aircraft that is the subject of a Permitted Encumbrance.
(f)           All sale, service, performance and equipment lease contracts as to which Guarantor is lessee, agreements and grants (whether written or oral), and any other contract (whether written or oral) between Guarantor and third parties (except for any real property leases, or any equipment leases that do not allow an assignment of such leases by their terms, neither of which shall be Collateral).
(g)           The entire goodwill and all product lines of Guarantor's business and other general intangibles, including, without limitation, know-how, trade secrets, customer lists, proprietary information, inventions, methods, procedures and formulae in connection with the use of and symbolized by the trademarks of Guarantor.
(h)           All books, records, ledger cards, data processing records, computer software, and other property at any time evidencing or relating to the Collateral.

(j)           All parts (other than parts included in the purchase of Aircraft that is the subject of a Permitted Encumbrance), accessories, attachments, special tools, additions, replacements, substitutions, and accessions to or for all of the foregoing.
(k)           All proceeds and products of all of the foregoing in any form, including, without limitation, amounts payable under any policies of insurance insuring the foregoing against loss or damage, and all increases and profits received from all of the foregoing.
(l)           provided, however, the Collateral shall not include any rights or interests of Guarantor under any licenses, leases or other contracts if and to the extent that the granting of a security interest in such licenses, leases or contracts is prohibited as a matter of law (as opposed to a contractual prohibition); provided, further, (i) if any such prohibition is no longer effective, a security interest therein in favor of Agent shall automatically arise hereunder without any further action on the part of Guarantor or Agent and (ii) nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit, impair or otherwise affect Agents security interest in any rights or interests of Guarantor in or to monies due or to become due under any such agreement.

3
 
(a)           Guarantor hereby expressly waives:  (i) notice of the existence or creation or non-payment of all or any of the Liabilities, (ii) presentment, demand, notice of dishonor, protest, and all other notices whatsoever, (iii) all diligence in collection or protection of or realization upon any Liabilities or any security for or guaranty of any Liabilities, (iv) any obligation of the Lenders to proceed directly against or exhaust any Collateral held by the Lenders from the Borrowers, any other guarantor, or any other person, and (v) any claim or right which Guarantor may now have or hereafter acquire against any Borrower or any other person or entity that arises from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of the obligations of Guarantor under this Agreement, including (without limitation) any right of subrogation, reimbursement, restitution, exoneration, contribution or indemnification.
(b)           Guarantor authorizes the Lenders, without notice or demand and without lessening Guarantor's liability under this Agreement, from time to time:  (i) to make one or more additional secured or unsecured loans to the Borrowers, to lease equipment or other goods to the Borrowers, or otherwise to extend additional credit to the Borrowers; (ii) to alter, compromise, renew, extend, accelerate, or otherwise change one or more times the time for payment or other terms of the Liabilities or any part of the Liabilities, including increases and decreases of the rate of interest on the Liabilities; extensions may be repeated and may be for longer than the original loan terms; (iii) to take and hold security for the payment of this Guaranty or the Liabilities, and exchange, enforce, waive, subordinate, fail or decide not to perfect, and release any such security, with or without the substitution of new collateral; (iv) to release, substitute, agree not to sue, or deal with any one or more of the Borrowers' sureties, endorsers, or other guarantors on any terms or in any manner the Agent or the Lenders may choose; (v) to determine how, when and what application of payments and credits shall be made on the Liabilities; (vi) to apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof, including without limitation, any nonjudicial sale permitted by the terms of the controlling security agreement or deed of trust, as the Agent in its discretion may determine; (vii) to sell, transfer, assign, or grant participations in all or any part of the Liabilities; and (viii) to assign or transfer this Agreement in whole or in part.

The provisions of this section shall survive repayment of the Indebtedness.

Guarantor agrees that the indebtedness of the Borrowers to the Lenders, whether now existing or hereafter created, shall be superior to any claim that Guarantor may now have or hereafter acquire against the Borrowers, whether or not the Borrowers becomes insolvent.  Guarantor hereby expressly subordinates any claim it may have against the Borrowers, upon any account whatsoever, to any claim that the Lenders may now or hereafter have against the Borrowers.  In the event of insolvency and consequent liquidation of the assets of the Borrowers, through bankruptcy, by an assignment for the benefit of creditors, by voluntary liquidation, or otherwise, the assets of the Borrowers applicable to the payment of the claims of both the Lenders and Guarantor shall be paid to the Lenders and shall be first applied by the Lenders to the indebtedness of the Borrowers to the Lenders.  Guarantor does hereby assign to the Lenders all claims which it may have or acquire against the Borrowers or against any assignee or trustee in bankruptcy of the Borrowers; provided however, that such assignment shall be effective only for the purpose of assuring to the Lenders full payment of all amounts due to the Lenders by the Borrowers.  If Agent so requests, any notes or credit agreements now or hereafter evidencing any debts or obligations of the Borrowers to Guarantor shall be marked with a legend that the same are subject to this Agreement and shall be delivered to the Lenders.  Guarantor agrees, and the Agent is hereby authorized, in the name of Guarantor, from time to time to execute and file financing statements and continuation statements and to execute such other documents and to take such other actions as the Lenders deems necessary or appropriate to perfect, preserve and enforce its rights under this Agreement.
This Guaranty shall terminate with respect to any Guarantor upon the dissolution of such Guarantor if (i) Guarantor has given Agent thirty (30) days prior written notice of such proposed dissolution and (ii) the dissolution of such Guarantor would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
(a)           No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement nor consent to any departure by the Lenders therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Guarantor and the Lenders, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.
(b)           Except as otherwise provided herein, all notices, consents and other communications required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given and received when (i) delivered in person, (ii) deposited with a carrier for delivery on the next business day, (iii) deposited in the mail if mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, or (iv) sent by facsimile transmission with confirmation received to the party to receive such notice at the addresses set forth on the signature page hereto.

(g)           Guarantor agrees to pay all expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and legal expenses) paid or incurred by the Lenders in endeavoring to collect the Liabilities against Guarantor, or any part thereof, in realizing upon or protecting any collateral for this Agreement, and otherwise in enforcing this Agreement against Guarantor.
(h)           The creation or existence from time to time of additional Liabilities to the Lenders is hereby authorized, without notice to Guarantor, and shall in no way affect or impair the rights of the Lenders or the obligations of Guarantor under this Agreement, including Guarantor's guaranty of such additional Liabilities.

EXHIBIT 99.1
The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company
 
DENVER, CO., November 8, 2007 -- Air Methods Corporation (NasdaqGS: AIRM) reported results for the quarter ended September 30, 2007.  Revenue increased 12% to $101.5 million from $90.5 million in the year-ago quarter.  For the nine-month period, revenue increased 13% to $273.7 million, up from $242.0 million in the prior-year nine-month period.
 
For the quarter, net income increased 17% to $11.2 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, as compared with prior-year quarter net income of $9.6 million, or $0.78 per diluted share.  Net income for the nine-month period was $22.7 million, or $1.82 per diluted share, compared to $16.0 million, or $1.30 per diluted share for the prior-year nine-month period.  The current-year quarter includes a $1.2 million pre-tax net gain on disposition of assets, offset by a $0.8 million loss on early extinguishment of debt.  Net of income taxes, the gain on disposition less the loss on early extinguishment of debt increased net income by approximately $0.3 million or $0.02 per diluted share.  The prior-year quarter included a $1.4 million gain from a litigation settlement.  Net of income taxes, the litigation settlement gain increased prior-year quarter net income by approximately $0.8 million or $0.07 per diluted share.
 
The third quarter 2007 financial results do not reflect any operations of FSS Airholdings, Inc., the parent company of CJ Systems Aviation Group, Inc. (CJ), since the acquisition was not completed until October 1, 2007.
 
Third Quarter Highlights
 
  Revenue from community-based services increased 12% to $69.3 million, and segment net income increased 10% to $20.5 million during the third quarter, as compared with segment net income of $18.6 million in the prior-year quarter.  The increase in segment net income was partly attributed to decreases in maintenance expense as compared with the prior-year quarter.  Maintenance expense decreased 3% or $183,000, even though flight volume increased by 14%.  This decrease was attributed to fewer maintenance events related to older models of aircraft than during the 2006 period.  Community-based transports completed during the third quarter were 10,466 as compared with 9,187 in the prior-year quarter, a 14% increase.  Community-based transports for bases in operation greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) increased slightly by 16 transports, while weather cancellations for bases in operation greater than one year decreased by 253 transports or 11%.  The increase in transports did not correspond to the decrease in weather cancellations primarily due to shifting of transports to newly-opened bases in adjacent locations.  Net reimbursement per transport of $6,519 in the current-year quarter compares with $6,716 and $6,330 in the prior-year quarter and the second quarter of 2007, respectively.
Community-Based Services:
 
  Revenue from hospital-based services increased by 6% to $29.4 million, while segment net income increased to $2.0 million in the current-year quarter from a loss of $0.1 million during the prior-year third quarter.  The increase in revenue is primarily attributed to annual price increases and a 6.2% increase in flight volume.  The net increase in segment earnings is primarily attributed to a decrease in maintenance expense.  Maintenance expense for the quarter decreased by $1.1 million, or 12%, despite the increase in flight volume, attributed to the same factors mentioned above.
Hospital-Based Services:
 
Revenue, including revenue generated from internal projects, increased 12% to $7.8 million, while segment net income increased 18% to $1.8 million from $1.5 million during the third quarter as compared with the prior-year quarter.  The majority of the current year quarterly revenue (63%) and segment net income (62%) related to internal projects and has been eliminated in the consolidated financial results.
Products Division:  
 
The Company also provided an update on October 2007 flight volume.  Total community-based transports of 3,793 during October 2007 compared with 2,971 during October 2006.  Of the October 2007 transports, 631 are from community bases added as a result of our acquisition of CJ.  Same-Base Transports, which exclude CJ bases and other new locations, during the month of October decreased 151 transports, while weather cancellations for these same bases increased by 129 transports.
 
Aaron Todd, Chief Executive Officer, stated, We are pleased to have shown healthy growth in both top line and bottom line performance during the quarter, especially since the prior-year third quarter was an exceptionally strong quarter for us.  Continued strength in net reimbursement rates, moderation of maintenance expense, and consistent Same-Base Transports for community-based services have all contributed to this growth in earnings.  Days sales outstanding in receivables for community-based services reflect a decrease from 117 days as of September 30, 2006 to 107 days of September 30, 2007.  The reduction in days sales outstanding, combined with the strength of our operating results, resulted in $31.8 million in net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2007.  Long-term debt less cash decreased by $20.7 million during the same nine-month period, as well.   We are well on our way to achieving our beginning of the year objective of growing earnings per share by greater than 20%.

A material failure to perform his duties hereunder that results from the disability of the Executive shall not be considered Cause for his termination.
Termination
 
5.           .  If the Executive shall be prevented by illness, accident, or other incapacity from properly performing his duties hereunder (and, if required by the Company, upon the furnishing of evidence satisfactory to the Company of such disability), the Company shall, during the continuance of his disability but only for the remaining term of this Agreement or six (6) months, whichever is greater, pay the Executive his compensation payable under the provisions of Section 3 (above) and continue to provide the Executive all other benefits provided hereunder, provided that any amount received during such time by the Executive under a disability insurance policy carried by the Company shall be credited against the compensation due to the Executive.  As used herein, the term disability shall mean the complete and total inability of the Executive, due to illness, physical or comprehensive mental impairment to substantially perform all of his duties as described herein for a consecutive period of thirty (30) days or more.
Disability
 
6.           .  In the event of the death of the Executive, except with respect to any benefits which have accrued and have not been paid to the Executive hereunder, the provisions of this Employment Agreement shall terminate immediately.

Death

7.           . Subject to the conditions set forth below, in the event that the Executives employment is terminated by the Company other than for Cause, whether during or after the term of this Agreement, the Executive shall be entitled, for a period of twelve (12) months following the termination, to receive compensation at an annual rate equal to the Executives highest cash compensation received during any 12-month period of his employment, payable at the Companys regular payment intervals; provided, that if any of such payments would (i) constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and (ii) but for this proviso be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the Excise Tax), the amount payable hereunder shall be reduced to the largest amount which the Executive determines would result in no portion of the payments hereunder being subject to the Excise Tax.  In addition, the Executive shall be entitled to continue to receive at the Companys expense, coverage under the Companys health insurance policies, or comparable coverage, during the term of such severance payments, but only until the Executive begins other employment in connection with which he is entitled to health insurance coverage.  As a condition of the Executives right to receive severance compensation as provided above, the Executive shall sign and deliver to the Company a release of all claims that the Executive might otherwise assert against the Company, in a form approved by the Company.  If the Executive voluntarily resigns his employment hereunder, or if his employment is terminated for Cause, the Executive shall not be entitled to any severance pay or other compensation beyond the date of termination of his employment.
Severance Pay
 
8.           .  In the event that a Change of Control of the Company, as hereinafter defined, occurs, and the Executives employment by the Company, or a successor to the business of the Company, is terminated by the Company or the successor in connection with, or within one year after, the occurrence of such Change of Control, or if, after a Change of Control, the Executive terminates his employment as a result of a constructive termination of his employment by the Company or such successor, the Executive shall be entitled for a period of two (2) years following such termination or constructive termination, to receive compensation at an annual rate equal to the Executives highest cash compensation received during any 12-month period of his employment, payable at the Companys regular payment intervals; provided, that if any of such payments would (i) constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and (ii) but for this proviso be subject to the Excise Tax, the amount payable hereunder shall be reduced to the largest amount which the Executive determines would result in no portion of the payments hereunder being subject to the Excise Tax.  For purposes of this Section, a constructive termination by the Company or its successor shall be deemed to occur if the Executive is assigned to another position, not comparable in terms of salary, duties, status or authority, or substantially reducing the Executives job responsibilities and authority from the position, responsibilities and/or authority held by the Executive prior to the Change of Control, or if the Executives place of work shall be moved more than 75 miles from the Executives place of work with the Company prior to the Change of Control.  For purposes of this Section 8, a Change of Control shall be deemed to have occurred in the event that a merger, sale of assets, sale or exchange of stock, or other corporate reorganization occurs with another corporation or other entity, following which and as a result of which, at least 50% of the ownership interest of the surviving corporation is held by persons other than the shareholders of the Company prior to such transaction, or a majority of the directors of the surviving corporation are persons other than the directors of the Company prior to such transaction.  Any notice by the Executive to the Company or its successor claiming a constructive termination of the Executive shall specify the claimed default by the Company or the successor and the Company or its successor shall have ninety (90) days to make such modifications in the Executives working relationship as to overcome the constructive termination.
Change of Control/Constructive Termination

9.           .  The Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify the Executive and hold him harmless if he is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, by reason of the fact that the Executive is or was an officer and employee of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the Executive in connection with such action, suit or proceeding so long as the Executive acted in good faith and in a manner that he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company shall pay such expenses of the Executive in advance of the final disposition of such action upon satisfying such conditions as may be imposed by law with respect to such advances.
Indemnification
 
10.             During the continuance of his employment by the Company and for a period of twelve (12) months after termination of his employment, the Executive shall not, anywhere in the United States, engage in any business which competes directly or indirectly with the Company.  Any company or business which is engaged in the air medical transport business or the business of furnishing or retrofitting aircraft to provide medical transports shall be deemed to be engaged in business in competition with the Company.
Covenant Not to Compete.
 
11.           .  During his employment by the Company, and for a period of five (5) years thereafter, the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, use, disseminate, or disclose for any purpose other than for the purposes of the Companys business, any of the Companys confidential information or trade secrets, unless such disclosure is compelled in a judicial proceeding.  Upon termination of his employment, all documents, records, notebooks, and similar repositories of records containing information relating to any trade secrets or confidential information then in the Executives possession or control, whether prepared by him or by others, shall be left with the Company or returned to the Company upon its request.
Trade Secrets and Confidential Information
 
12.           .  It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of Sections 10 and 11 shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.  Accordingly, if any particular sentence or portion of either Section 10 or 11 shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions of such section nevertheless shall continue to be valid and enforceable as though the invalid portions were not a part thereof.  In the event that any of the provisions of Section 10 relating to the geographic areas of restriction or the period of restriction shall be deemed to exceed the maximum area or period of time which a court of competent jurisdiction would deem enforceable, the geographic areas and times shall, for the purposes of this Agreement, be deemed to be the maximum areas or time periods which a court of competent jurisdiction would deem valid and enforceable in any state in which such court of competent jurisdiction shall be convened.
Severability
 
-5-
 
13.           .  The Executive agrees that any violation by him of the agreements contained in Sections 10 and 11 are likely to cause irreparable damage to the Company, and therefore agrees that if there is a breach or threatened breach by the Executive of the provisions of said sections, the Company shall be entitled to an injunction restraining the Executive from such breach.  Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting the Company from pursuing any other remedies for such breach or threatened breach.
Injunctive Relief
 
14.           .

Any notice required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be directed to the appropriate party in writing and mailed or delivered, if to the Company, to 7301 South Peoria, Englewood, Colorado 80112 or to the Companys then principal office, if different, and if to the Executive, to such address as the Executive may have furnished to the Company for this purpose or, if the Executive has furnished no such address, to the Executives last known address as shown on the Companys records.

EXHIBIT 99.1
The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company
 
DENVER, CO., March 12, 2008 -- Air Methods Corporation (NasdaqGS: AIRM), the largest air medical transportation company in the world, reported revenue and net income for the year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2007.
 
For the year, revenue increased 24% to $396.3 million compared to $319.5 million in the prior year.  Net income was $27.5 million or $2.20 per diluted share compared to $17.2 million or $1.40 per diluted share, a 57% increase.  The current year results include a $1.1 million ($0.08 per diluted share) decrease in income tax expense resulting from approved changes in tax depreciation methods applied to prior years.  The prior-year results included an increase in income tax expense of $0.5 million (0.04 per diluted share) resulting from a higher expected federal tax rate applied to deferred income tax liabilities.
 
For the fourth quarter, revenue increased 58% to $122.6 million as compared with $77.5 million during the prior-year period.  Net income increased to $4.8 million or $0.38 per diluted share compared to net income of $1.2 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the prior-year period.  The current-year quarter results include a $1.1 million ($0.08 per diluted share) decrease in income tax expense as discussed above, offset in part by a $0.5 million after tax loss ($0.04 per diluted share) on disposition of assets.  The prior-year fourth quarter included an increase in income tax expense of $0.8 million ($0.06 per diluted share) resulting from the higher expected federal tax rate applied to deferred income tax liabilities mentioned above.
 
Approximately $30.3 million of the $45.1 million increase in revenue during the fourth quarter was attributed to hospital-based and community-based revenue generated from bases added in the acquisition of the parent company of CJ Systems Aviation Group, Inc. (CJ) effective October 1, 2007.  Excluding revenue related to the CJ acquisition, revenue growth was 19% during the fourth quarter as compared with the prior-year quarter.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2007, total patients transported within community-based operations were 10,737, as compared with 8,382 during the prior-year quarter.  Patients transported for community bases in operation greater than one year and excluding CJ bases (Same-Base Transports) decreased by 543 patients or 7%, while weather cancellations for these same bases increased by 521 transports or 25%, compared with the prior-year period.  Revenue per community-based transport increased from $5,958 in the fourth quarter of 2006 and $6,519 in the third quarter of 2007, to $6,597 in the current-year fourth quarter.
 
The Company also provided an update on first quarter 2008 flight volume.  Same-Base Transports within community-based operations through February were down 205 patient transports or 4% as compared with the prior-year period, while weather cancellations for these same bases increased 560 or 40% as compared with the prior-year period.  Total community-based patient transports for the two- month period were 6,812, as compared with 5,190 in the prior-year period.
 
 
 
Aaron Todd, CEO of Air Methods, commented, We are extremely proud of our 2007 annual and fourth quarter results.  To have achieved such significant growth in fourth quarter earnings despite the severe weather experienced during the month of December is strong evidence that the CJ acquisition is on track to achieve its first year objectives.  The ongoing strength in reimbursement for community-based transports, combined with continued moderation of maintenance expenditures associated with our fleet rejuvenation initiatives, also offset the impact of weather during the quarter.
 
Mr. Todd added, Despite the impact of weather on transports during the first two months of 2008, we remain very optimistic that we can achieve another year of healthy earnings growth.  With the acquisition of CJ closing on October 1, 2007, we look forward to the expected benefit of a full year of combined operating results in 2008.  With deliveries of over 45 new aircraft anticipated in 2008, fleet rejuvenation activity will accelerate and should favorably impact historical hourly maintenance costs in the future.  These new aircraft also create expansion opportunities within both services divisions.
 
The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern.  Interested parties can access the call by dialing (888) 396-5640 (domestic) or (706) 643-0580 (international) or by accessing the web cast at .

These Same-Base Transports and weather cancellations exclude bases acquired from CJ Systems Aviation Group, Inc. (CJ) effective October 1, 2007.
 
The Company also announced that maintenance and fuel costs for the quarter were higher than anticipated and higher than levels experienced during the fourth quarter of 2007, the first full quarter of combined operations with CJ.  Maintenance expenditures per estimated flight hour increased 14% during the first quarter as compared with the fourth quarter of 2007 and resulted in approximately $2.5 million increased expense.  Fuel costs per community-based patient transport during the first quarter of 2008 were 39% higher than the first quarter of 2007.  This resulted in approximately $1 million increase in expense based on first quarter 2008 patient flight activity.
 
Offsetting these increases in flight cancellations and operating costs was $1.3 million in gains generated from disposition of aircraft.  These aircraft were sold during the first quarter of 2008 as part of the Companys continuing fleet rejuvenation activities.
 
Based on preliminary results, the Company estimates that its fully diluted earnings will be between $0.17 and $0.20 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2008.  The Company noted that these preliminary results are subject to final quarter-end closing and review procedures and are therefore subject to change.
 
Aaron Todd, CEO, stated, While we are disappointed with the impact of these events on our quarterly results, variations in weather cancellations and maintenance events are common to our operations from quarter-to-quarter.   We continue to remain optimistic of our ability to achieve strong growth in year-over-year earnings per share dependent on more moderate weather cancellations and maintenance activities.  To compensate for the recent significant increases in fuel costs and to help offset the impact of these first quarter events, the Company will increase its charges for community-based transports by an average 7% effective May 1.  Further increases will be considered during the remainder of 2008 should they be needed.

EXHIBIT 99.1
The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company
 
DENVER, CO., May 8, 2008 -- Air Methods Corporation (NasdaqGS: AIRM), the largest air medical transportation company in the world, reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2008 and provided an update on April 2008 flight volumes.  For the quarter, revenue increased 45.0% to $118.1 million from $81.5 million in the year-ago quarter.  Net income for the first quarter of 2008 was $2.3 million or $0.18 per diluted share, compared with net income of $3.7 million or $0.30 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2007.  Current quarter net income includes an after-tax gain of $0.8 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, generated from disposition of aircraft.
 
As previously announced, the decrease in net income was primarily attributed to decreases in community-based patient transports as a result of increased weather cancellations, and higher than anticipated maintenance and fuel expenditures.  Community-based patient transports for bases in operation greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) decreased by 577 transports, while weather cancellations for these same bases increased by 636, as compared with the prior-year quarter.  Same-Base Transports and weather cancellations exclude bases acquired from CJ Systems Aviation Group, Inc. (CJ) effective October 1, 2007.  Aircraft maintenance expense during the quarter, excluding aircraft acquired in the CJ acquisition and those added after March 31, 2007, increased 35.7% or $4.0 million as compared with the prior-year quarter.  Fuel expense per flight hour increased 44%, or approximately $1.1 million, as compared with the prior-year period.
 
Net revenue per community-based transport increased 2.8% from $6,443 in the prior-year quarter to $6,622 in the current-year quarter.  The current-year quarterly revenue per transport was slightly lower than anticipated due to inherent fluctuations in payer mix and differences between actual collections and previous estimates.  Total community-based patient transports were 10,570 in the current year quarter, compared to 8,284 in the first quarter of 2007.
 
For the first quarter, community-based revenue increased 29.8% to $69.3 million compared to $53.4 million in the prior year, while segment net income decreased 26.6% to $5.8 million from $7.9 million.  Hospital-based flight revenue increased 72.4% from $26.2 million to $45.2 million in the current-year period, while segment net income remained unchanged at $1.8 million for both current and prior periods.  The increase in revenue is primarily attributed to the acquisition of CJ, which occurred on October 1, 2007.  The decrease in segment net income for both divisions as a percentage of revenue is primarily attributed to the matters discussed above.
 
The Company also provided an update on April 2008 flight volume.  Total community-based transports were 3,722 during April 2008 compared with 3,071 in April 2007.  Same-Base Transports during the month of April decreased by 254 transports or 8.6% as compared with April 2007.  The decrease in transports was almost entirely attributed to an increase of 230 in weather cancellations for bases in operation greater than one year and excluding bases acquired from CJ.
 
Aaron Todd, CEO, stated, As we had previously announced, the factors that affected our first quarter results are inherent within our operations.  Weather and maintenance fluctuations can vary widely from quarter-to-quarter and are not necessarily predictive of future quarters.  The variation in our community-based transport revenue is consistent with variations in recent quarters and is not attributed to any specific changes in reimbursement trends.  The increase in fuel prices does have direct relevance to future quarters.  As previously announced, the Company has increased its pricing for community-based patient transports by 7% effective May 1 to offset the expected impact of higher fuel prices.  The Company continues to expect healthy growth in year-over-year earnings per share dependent on more moderate weather cancellations and maintenance activities and consistent reimbursement trends for the remainder of the year.

EXHIBIT 99.1
The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company
DENVER, CO., July 24, 2008 -- Air Methods Corporation (NasdaqGS: AIRM), the largest air medical transportation company in the world, provided an update on second quarter 2008 results.
Based on preliminary 2008 second quarter results, total community-based patient transports were 11,635.  Patients transported for community bases in operation greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) decreased 651 transports or 7%, while weather cancellations for these same bases increased by 459 transports compared with the prior-year quarter.  For the six-month period ended June 30, 2008, Same-Base Transports decreased by 1,228 or 7%, while weather cancellations increased by 1,095.  These Same-Base Transports and weather cancellations exclude bases acquired from CJ Systems Aviation Group, Inc. (CJ) effective October 1, 2007.  Net revenue per community-based transport was approximately $6,725 for the current-year quarter, compared with $6,412 in the prior-year quarter and $6,622 in the first quarter of 2008.
The Company also announced that fuel costs per community-based patient transport were 58% higher than during the prior-year quarter.  Based on patients transported during the current-year quarter, this increase resulted in approximately $1.8 million in increased fuel costs.  Maintenance expenditures per flight hour increased approximately 21% during the current quarter as compared with the second quarter of 2007, excluding the effect of aircraft acquired in the CJ acquisition.  Total consolidated cost per flight hour was relatively unchanged with first quarter 2008 levels.  While the Company had anticipated higher maintenance costs during the second quarter as compared to the prior-year quarter, actual costs on a volume-adjusted basis exceeded expectations by approximately $0.8 million.  The Company also reported that the combined, uninsured costs of the accidents experienced during the current-year quarter were approximately $0.6 million.
Based on preliminary results, the Company estimates that its fully-diluted earnings will be between $0.38 and $0.41 per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2008.  The Company noted that these preliminary results are subject to final quarter-end closing and review procedures and are therefore subject to change.
Aaron Todd, CEO, stated, While we are disappointed that weather, further increases in fuel costs and additional overruns in maintenance expenditures have impacted our second quarter results, we know by experience that weather and maintenance costs can shift quickly from quarter-to-quarter.  We are pleased that recent price increases have continued to generate growth in net revenue per transport.  Due to the severity of increases in fuel costs, the Company has implemented another 6% price increase in gross charges for community-based transports effective July 1, 2008.  As a result of over 1,000 patient transports lost to increased weather cancellations and the higher fuel and maintenance costs during the first half of 2008, we believe our ability to achieve growth in fully-diluted earnings per share for the full year is improbable.  However, we remain optimistic that moderating weather and maintenance activities, combined with continued improvement in reimbursement from recent price increases, will restore earnings growth in the near-term.  This expectation is also dependent upon fuel prices remaining at current levels.
 
 
 
The Company will report financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2008 after the close of the market on Thursday, August 7, 2008.  The Company has scheduled a conference call for Thursday, August 7, 2008 at 4:15 p.m. Eastern to discuss the results of the quarter.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company
 
DENVER, CO., August 7th, 2008 -- Air Methods Corporation (NasdaqGS: AIRM), the largest air medical transportation company in the world, reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2008 and provided an update on July 2008 flight volumes.  For the quarter, revenue increased 41% to $128.0 million from $90.7 million in the prior-year quarter.  For the six-month period, revenue increased 43% to $246.1 million, compared with $172.2 million in the prior-year six-month period.
 
For the quarter, net income decreased 38% to $4.8 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, as compared with prior-year quarter net income of $7.8 million, or $0.63 per diluted share.  Net income for the six-month period was $7.2 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, compared to $11.5 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, for the prior-year six-month period.
 
As previously announced, the decrease in net income was primarily attributed to decreases in community-based patient transports as a result of increased weather cancellations, and higher than anticipated fuel and maintenance expenditures.  Community-based patient transports for bases in operation greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) decreased by 651 transports, while weather cancellations for these same bases increased by 459, as compared with the prior-year quarter.  Same-Base Transports and weather cancellations exclude bases acquired from CJ Systems Aviation Group, Inc. (CJ) effective October 1, 2007.  Aircraft maintenance expense per flight hour during the quarter, excluding aircraft acquired in the CJ acquisition, increased 15% as compared with the prior-year quarter, resulting in an increase of $1.7 million in maintenance expense based on actual flight volume for the quarter.  The actual increase in maintenance expense was smaller than the previously announced increase of 21% as a result of final quarter-end adjustments to preliminary calculations.  Maintenance expense per flight hour, excluding CJ aircraft, decreased 6% during the current quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2008.   As previously reported, fuel expense per community-based patient transport increased 58% as compared with the prior-year quarter, resulting in an increase of approximately $1.8 million in fuel costs based on patients transported during the quarter.  The second quarter 2008 financial results also include approximately $0.7 million in uninsured costs associated with recent accidents, slightly higher than previously reported preliminary results.
 
The current-year quarter and six-month period include approximately $1.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively for the re-training of CJ pilots to transition operations to a single Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operating certificate.  These costs include incremental compensation expense for pilots and training personnel, in addition to hourly maintenance and fuel expenses associated with incremental training flights.  This re-training process was completed at the end of the second quarter.
 
The increase in revenue for the current-year quarter and six-month period is primarily attributed to the acquisition of CJ.  Excluding revenue generated from operating bases added in the CJ acquisition, consolidated revenue increased approximately 11% for the current-year quarter and six-month period as compared with the prior year.
 
For the second quarter, community-based revenue increased 26% to $77.7 million compared to $61.8 million in the prior year, while segment net income decreased 22% to $11.2 million from $14.3 million.  Excluding CJ operating locations, community-based revenue increased 7%.  As previously reported, total community-based patient transports were 11,635, as compared with 9,769 in the prior-year quarter.  Net revenue per community-based transport was $6,727 for the current-year quarter, compared with $6,412 in the prior-year quarter and $6,622 in the first quarter of 2008.  Hospital-based revenue increased 69% to $47.0 million compared to $27.9 million in the prior-year period, while segment net income decreased slightly to $1.1 million from $1.3 million.  Excluding CJ operating locations, hospital-based revenue increased 11%.The decrease in segment net income for both divisions is attributed to the factors discussed above.
 
 
 
 
The Company also provided an update on July 2008 flight volume.  Total community-based transports were 3,832 during July 2008 compared with 3,495 in July 2007.  Same-Base Transports during the month of July decreased by 415 transports or 12% as compared with July 2007.  The decrease in transports was partially attributed to a 218 increase in weather cancellations for bases in operation greater than one year and excluding bases acquired from CJ.  A small portion of the remaining decrease in Same-Base Transports during the month is also attributed to fewer patients being transported from auto accident scenes.  The recent spike in fuel prices is believed to have reduced discretionary travel, resulting in decreased demand for service.  Although scene flights typically represent only 40% of total patient transports with the remaining 60% representing transports between hospitals, almost 50% of the reduction in Same-Base Transports in July was attributed to a decrease in scene flights.
 
Aaron Todd, CEO, stated, Weather has been more severe than the prior-year period in every month in 2008 except January.  This has had the most significant impact on our year-over-year results due to the high fixed-cost nature of our operating expenses.  Recent spikes in fuel prices and higher than anticipated maintenance expenditures have also impacted our results.  Despite these challenges, we remain optimistic for future periods.  Weather will eventually moderate.  Fuel prices have fallen significantly from their recent highs, while the cost of consolidating FAA certificates is now behind us.  In addition, we continue to realize improvement in net reimbursement per transport from recent price increases.  We would anticipate a return to growth in profits as these expectations become realized.
 
The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern.  Interested parties can access the call by dialing (888) 396-5640 (domestic) or (706) 643-0580 (international) or by accessing the web cast at .

EXHIBIT 99.1
DENVER, CO., October 23, 2008 -- Air Methods Corporation (NasdaqGS: AIRM), the largest air medical transportation company in the world, provided an update on third quarter 2008 results.
 
Based on preliminary 2008 third quarter results, total community-based patient transports were 10,690.  Patients transported for community bases in operation greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) decreased 1,552 transports or 16%, while weather cancellations for these same bases increased by 422 transports compared with the prior-year quarter.  Excluding impact of higher weather cancellations, Same-Base Transports decreased 11%.  These Same-Base Transports and weather cancellations exclude bases acquired from CJ Systems Aviation Group, Inc. (CJ) effective October 1, 2007.  The decrease in patient transports in excess of higher weather cancellations is attributed to a third-quarter spike in fuel prices and its impact on traffic volume, slowdown in economic activity, and lost flights due to redeployment of numerous aircraft and crews to respond to Hurricanes Gustav and Ike.  Gross revenues generated from hurricane response during the third quarter exceeded $6.8 million, compared with $1.0 million in the prior-year quarter.  These hurricane revenue amounts are before incremental costs and expenses, including crew compensation, fuel, travel expenses, maintenance costs, and lost revenue from redeployment of fleet.
 
Net revenue per community-based transport increased 8% to $7,090 for the current-year quarter, compared with $6,560 in the prior-year quarter.  Net revenue per community-based transport increased 5% compared with $6,727 in the second quarter of 2008.  Net revenue per community-based transport excludes revenue generated from hurricane response activities.
 
The Company also announced that fuel costs per community-based patient transport were 56% higher than during the prior-year quarter.  Based on patients transported during the current-year quarter, this increase resulted in approximately $1.7 million in increased fuel costs.  Maintenance expenditures increased approximately 18%, or $2.6 million, during the current quarter as compared with the third quarter of 2007, after excluding aircraft acquired in the CJ acquisition.   The company also reported that the current-year third quarter results include net gains on disposition of aircraft of $1.1 million, or approximately $0.05 per share after income taxes.
 
Based on preliminary results, the Company estimates that its fully-diluted earnings will be between $0.67 and $0.70 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2008.  The Company noted that these preliminary results are subject to final quarter-end closing and review procedures and are therefore subject to change.
 
 
 
 
Aaron Todd, CEO, stated, Although our community-based flight volumes were weak during the quarter, we have experienced an 11% increase in projected October flight volume month-to-date as compared with the September volume of 3,196 transports.  Most of the recent significant decreases in fuel prices did not benefit the third quarter, and will be more fully realized in the fourth quarter of 2008.  We also anticipate that lower fuel prices will increase road travel, with related increase in demand for air medical transport.   We are pleased that recent price increases have continued to generate growth in net revenue per transport, and will continue to assess the need for future increases.
 
The Company will report financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 after the close of the market on Thursday, November 6, 2008.  The Company has scheduled a conference call for Thursday, November 6, 2008 at 4:15 p.m. Eastern to discuss the results of the quarter.

EXHIBIT 99.1
The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company
 
DENVER, CO., November 6, 2008 -- Air Methods Corporation (NasdaqGS: AIRM) reported results for the quarter ended September 30, 2008.  Revenue increased 32% to $133.8 million from $101.5 million in the year-ago quarter.  For the nine-month period, revenue increased 39% to $379.9 million, up from $273.7 million in the prior-year nine-month period.
For the quarter, net income decreased 25% to $8.4 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, as compared with prior-year quarter net income of $11.2 million, or $0.89 per diluted share.  Net income for the nine-month period was $15.5 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, compared to $22.7 million, or $1.82 per diluted share, for the prior-year period.  The current-year and prior-year quarters included a $1.1 million and $1.2 million pre-tax net gain on disposition of assets, respectively, while the prior-year quarter included a $0.8 million pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt.
The third quarter 2007 financial results do not reflect any operations of FSS Airholdings, Inc., the parent company of CJ Systems Aviation Group, Inc. (CJ), since the acquisition was not completed until October 1, 2007.
Third Quarter Highlights
  Revenue from community-based services increased 19% to $82.6 million from $69.3 million, and segment net income decreased 15% to $17.5 million during the third quarter, as compared with segment net income of $20.5 million in the prior-year quarter.  As previously reported, the decrease in segment net income was primarily attributed to decreases in patients transported for community bases in operation greater than one year and excluding bases acquired from CJ (Same-Base Transports).  Same-Base Transports decreased 1,552 transports, or 16%, while weather cancellations for these same bases increased 422 transports compared with the prior-year quarter.  The decrease in revenue from reduction in Same-Base Transports was partially offset by $7.3 million in revenue generated from hurricane response activities during the quarter, as well as from a 7% increase in net revenue per community-based transport to $7,047 from $6,560 in the prior year quarter.  Segment net income also reflects a $0.7 million, or 12%, increase in maintenance expenditures over the prior-year quarter, excluding aircraft added since July 1, 2007.   In addition, fuel expense increased 56% per hour flown as compared with the prior-year quarter, which increased fuel expense by $1.8 million.  Revenue generated from bases added in the CJ acquisition was $10.8 million during the current-year quarter.
Community-Based Services:
  Revenue from hospital-based services increased by 65% to $48.6 million from $29.4 million, while segment net income decreased to $0.4 million in the current-year quarter from $2.0 million during the prior-year third quarter.  The increase in revenue is primarily attributed to $15.9 million generated during the current-year quarter from the assumption of CJ hospital-based contracts.  This increased revenue was partially offset by an 11% decrease in flight volume, excluding locations added or closed since July 1, 2007, which decreased flight revenues by approximately $1.2 million.  The net decrease in segment earnings is primarily attributed to an increase in maintenance expense.  Maintenance expense for the quarter increased by $2.1 million, or 24%, excluding aircraft added since July 1, 2007.
Hospital-Based Services:
Revenue, excluding revenue generated from internal projects, decreased slightly from $2.9 million to $2.7 million in the current-year quarter.  Segment net income, excluding internal projects, was unchanged at $0.7 million.
Products Division:  
 
 
 
The Company also provided an update on October 2008 flight volume.  Total community-based transports   during October 2008 were 3,495 compared with 3,796 during October 2007.  Patient transports for community bases in operation greater than one year, including CJ bases added October 1, 2007, decreased 163 transports or 5%, while weather cancellations for these same bases decreased by 297 transports.
Aaron Todd, Chief Executive Officer, stated, We are pleased with the strength of our earnings considering the weaker flight volume and higher maintenance and fuel expenses incurred during the quarter.  We are also pleased that October volume was favorably impacted by more moderate weather cancellation levels.  Recent significant decreases in fuel prices and expected lower weather cancellations compared to the severe weather in previous winter and spring periods should help to offset any continued softness in overall demand for air medical services.  In addition, continued improvement in net revenue per transport supports our current plans for continued price increases to keep pace with inflation in cost per transport.  Air Methods continues to enjoy strong positive cash flow having generated over $44.3 million in cash from operations during the first nine months of 2008.  We have used this excess cash to reduce debt levels, increase the size of our unencumbered fleet, and engage in stock repurchase activities.  While the current economic environment creates certain operational uncertainties, we continue to have a positive outlook for our future periods given recent trends in reduced fuel costs, moderating weather, improved reimbursement, and strong cash flows.
The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern.  Interested parties can access the call by dialing (877) 883-0656 (domestic) or (706) 643-8826 (international) or by accessing the web cast at .

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company
DENVER, CO., January 27, 2009 -- Air Methods Corporation (NasdaqGS: AIRM), the largest air medical transportation company in the world, provided an update on fourth quarter 2008 preliminary results.
Based on preliminary 2008 fourth quarter results, total community-based patient transports were 9,496. Patients transported for community bases in operation greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) decreased 831 transports or 8%, while weather cancellations for these same bases decreased by 394 transports compared with the prior-year quarter.  Excluding the benefit of lower weather cancellations, Same-Base Transports decreased 12%, consistent with the third quarter 2008 decrease.
Preliminary net revenue per community-based transport increased slightly over the third quarter 2008 result of $7,090 per transport.  Net revenue per community-based transport was $6,597 in the prior-year fourth quarter.
Preliminary maintenance expenditures per flight hour were slightly lower than the prior-year quarterly result of $572 per hour. The fourth quarter 2008 preliminary maintenance expense per hour moderated significantly from $673 per hour incurred in the third quarter of 2008.
The Company also announced that preliminary employee healthcare costs expensed by the company in the fourth quarter of 2008 were $1.2 million, or $0.06 per diluted share after taxes, higher than the prior-year fourth quarter. This represents a 39% increase per employee and was attributed to several large individual claims incurred during the quarter.
The Company noted that these preliminary results are subject to final year-end closing and independent audit procedures and are therefore subject to change.
Aaron Todd, CEO, stated, Although the weak economy has continued to affect demand for our service, we are pleased that the percentage decrease in Same-Base Transports was reduced by half compared with the third quarter of 2008 as a result of more favorable weather conditions, compared to the severe weather of the prior-year fourth quarter. Reimbursements have held strong during the quarter and maintenance expenses moderated as anticipated.  While the unusual increase in large individual healthcare claims was unanticipated, we do not expect a continuation of this higher expense level in future quarters. In addition, since weather cancellations were more severe during the first nine months of 2008, we would anticipate continued benefit in future quarters from potentially more moderate weather conditions.

(a)           The calculation of the Opening 2009 Valuation, which shall be determined after December 31, 2008 and as soon as administratively practicable, but in no event later than April 1, 2009; and
(b)           The calculation of the Closing 2010 Valuation and EVA, which shall be determined after the end of the Performance Period and as soon as administratively practicable, but in no event later than March 1, 2011.

Such adjustments may include, but are not limited to, the exclusion of significant, unusual, unbudgeted or noncontrollable gains or losses from actual financial results.  For example, and without limitation, the Committee may consider excluding: (i) profits or losses of any entities acquired by the Company during the Performance Period, or (ii) material gains or losses not in the budget which are of a nonrecurring nature and are not considered to be in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate or Property, gains resulting from insurance recoveries when such gains relate to claims filed in prior years, or losses resulting from natural catastrophes, when the cause of the catastrophe is beyond the control of the Company and did not result from any failure or negligence on the Companys part.  Any adjustments made by the Committee pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall be described in the certification of the EVA calculation, as required by Section 5.1(b) above, and the description shall include the reasoning for such adjustment.
5.2
Adjustments to EVA

           . Each Bonus Amount that becomes payable under the Plan shall be paid solely from the general assets of the Company.  Nothing in this Plan shall be construed to create a trust or to establish or evidence any Participants claim of any right other than as an unsecured general creditor with respect to any payment to which he may be entitled.
6.1
Right to Receive Payment

In the event the Participant voluntarily resigns from the Company or is terminated for Cause prior to a Payment Date, he may not collect any unpaid portion of the Bonus Amount not paid prior to such date of termination.  For example, if the Participant voluntarily resigns from the Company or is terminated for Cause after January 1, 2011, but prior to January 1, 2012, the Participant would not be entitled to receive any unpaid portion of the Bonus Amount, which would have otherwise been payable on January 1, 2012 and January 1, 2013.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Bonus Amount shall be immediately payable upon (i) the occurrence of a Change in Control, (ii) the date a Participants employment is terminated by reason of death or Disability, or (iii) the Companys termination of the Participants employment without Cause.

The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company
 
DENVER, CO., March 10, 2009 -- Air Methods Corporation (NasdaqGS: AIRM), the largest air medical transportation company in the world, reported revenue and net income for the year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2008.
 
For the year, revenue increased 26% to $498.8 million compared to $396.3 million in the prior year.  Net income decreased 30% from $27.5 million, or $2.20 per diluted share, in the prior year to $19.3 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, in the current year.  The current year results include a $1.5 million ($0.12 per diluted share) decrease in income tax expense resulting from a decrease in the effective state income tax rate due to a change in Colorado statute.  The prior-year results included a decrease in income tax expense of $1.1 million ($0.08 per diluted share) resulting from approved changes in tax depreciation methods.
 
For the fourth quarter, revenue decreased 3% to $118.9 million as compared with $122.6 million during the prior-year period.  Net income decreased 23% to $3.7 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, compared to net income of $4.8 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, in the prior-year period.  The current-year quarter results include a $1.5 million ($0.12 per diluted share) decrease in income tax expense as discussed above, while the prior-year fourth quarter included a decrease in income tax expense of $1.1 million ($0.08 per diluted share) also discussed above.   The Company had previously announced that its current-year fourth quarter results included a 39% increase in employee healthcare costs of $1.2 million ($0.06 per diluted share after taxes) as compared with the prior-year fourth quarter, attributed to several large individual claims.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2008, total patients transported within community-based operations were 9,496, as compared with 10,738 during the prior-year quarter, a 12% decrease.  Patients transported for community bases in operation greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) decreased by 831 transports, or 8%, while weather cancellations for these same bases decreased by 394 transports compared with the prior-year period.  Revenue per community-based transport increased from $6,597 in the fourth quarter of 2007 and $7,047 in the third quarter of 2008, to $7,156 in the current-year fourth quarter.  Consolidated maintenance expenses per flight hour of $572 during the current-year quarter were mostly unchanged from the prior-year fourth quarter.  Fuel expenses per community-based transport decreased by 4% to $330 as compared with the prior-year quarter.
 
The Company also provided an update on first quarter 2009 operations to-date.  Same-Base Transports within community-based operations through February were down 424 patient transports, or 7%, as compared with the prior-year period, while weather cancellations for these same bases decreased by 664 as compared with the prior-year period.  Total community-based patient transports for the two-month period were 5,936 as compared with 6,818 in the prior-year period.  For the month of February, Same-Based Transports were down only 2%.
 
 
 
 
 
The Company also announced that maintenance expenses for the month of January were significantly below historical levels.  Preliminary maintenance expenses were approximately 20% below the 2008 monthly average and January 2008 actual results.  In addition, net revenue per community-based transport in January reflected healthy increases over the fourth quarter 2008 average.  This improvement was attributed, in part, to the 5% price increase in gross charges effective January 1, 2009.  Fuel expenses per community-based transport in January were $241, reflecting a 24% decrease from the prior-year month.
 
Aaron Todd, CEO of Air Methods, commented, We are pleased with our fourth quarter results considering the recent softness in demand for service caused by the current economic environment.   Fuel prices and maintenance expenditures showed moderation during the last quarter of 2008 and have continued to improve significantly during the first month of 2009.  Our reimbursement continues to reflect benefits from previous price increases, while our flight volume through February is in line with our beginning-of-the-year expectations.
 
The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern.

The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company
 
DENVER, CO., April 23, 2009 -- Air Methods Corporation (NasdaqGS: AIRM), the largest air medical transportation company in the world, reported that preliminary first quarter 2009 earnings exceed expectations.  Expected earnings improvement is attributed to better-than-anticipated patient transports in March, improved reimbursement for community-based transports, and lower maintenance and fuel expense.
 
Total community-based patient transports were 9,432 during the current-year quarter.  Patients transported for community bases in operation greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) decreased 418 transports or 4%, while weather cancellations for these same bases decreased by 758 transports compared with the prior-year quarter.  During the month of March, Same-Base Transports increased by 6 transports or less than 1%, while weather cancellations for these same bases decreased by 94 transports compared with the prior-year month.
 
Preliminary net revenue per community-based transport for the first quarter of 2009 was in-line with managements expectations and reflects significant improvement over the prior-year first quarter result of $6,622 per transport, as well as an increase over the fourth quarter 2008 result of $7,156 per transport.
 
Preliminary maintenance expense reflects a $2.8 million reduction compared with the prior-year quarter.  Maintenance cost per flight hour decreased $43 per hour, or 7% compared with the prior-year quarterly result of $610 per hour.  Preliminary fuel expense decreased by $1.4 million compared with the prior-year quarter, while fuel costs per community-based patient transport decreased by $98 per transport, or 28% from $351 in the prior-year period.
 
The Company noted that these preliminary results are subject to final quarter-end closing and review procedures and are therefore subject to change.
 
Aaron Todd, CEO, stated, We are pleased to see a return to earnings growth for the first quarter of 2009. We are especially encouraged by the return to historical levels of demand for service during the month of March. Efforts to reduce maintenance costs through fleet rejuvenation and utilization of more efficient single-engine aircraft are now generating returns on these investments. The quarter has also benefited from greatly improved financial performance within our Products Division as a result of increased backlog and due to improved operating performance within our hospital-based operations.
 
The Company will report financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2009 after the close of the market on Thursday, May 7, 2009.  The Company has scheduled a conference call for Thursday, May 7, 2009 at 4:15 p.m. Eastern to discuss these results. 
Interested parties can access the call by dialing (877) 883-0656 (domestic) or (706) 643-8826 (international) or by accessing the web cast at .

The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company
 
DENVER, CO., May 7, 2009  Air Methods Corporation (NasdaqGS: AIRM), the largest air medical transportation company in the world, reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2009 and provided an update on April 2009 flight volumes.  For the quarter, revenue increased 5.6% to $124.7 million from $118.1 million in the prior-year quarter.  Net income for the first quarter of 2009 was $5.0 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, compared with net income of $2.3 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2008.  The prior-year quarter net income includes an after-tax gain of $0.8 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, generated from disposition of aircraft.
 
As previously announced, the increase in net income was primarily attributed to improved net reimbursement per community-based transport and lower maintenance and fuel expense.  Net revenue per community-based transport increased 10.3% to $7,305 during the current-year quarter from $6,622 in the prior-year period.  Maintenance expense during the first quarter of 2009 decreased by $2.8 million, or 13.5%, to $17.8 million, while maintenance cost per flight hour decreased by 7.0% as compared with the prior-year quarter.  Fuel expense decreased by $1.4 million, or 34.3%, to $2.7 million, while fuel costs per community-based transport decreased by 27.9% as compared with the prior-year quarter.
 
For the first quarter, community-based revenue decreased 1.3% to $68.4 million, compared to $69.3 million in the prior year, while segment net income increased 36.0% to $7.9 million from $5.8 million.  Hospital-based flight revenue increased 7.5% to $48.6 million from $45.3 million in the prior-year period, while segment net income more than doubled to $4.1 million compared with $1.8 million in the prior-year quarter.   Products Division external revenue also more than doubled to $7.6 million compared with $3.5 million in the prior-year quarter, while its external segment net income increased by over $0.9 million as compared with the prior year.
 
The Company also provided an update on April 2009 flight volume.  Total community-based transports were 3,453 during April 2009 compared with 3,723 in April 2008.  April 2009 community-based transports for bases open greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) decreased by 97 transports, or 2.9%, as compared with April 2008.  Weather cancellations during April 2009 for these same bases were mostly unchanged as compared with the prior-year month, decreasing by just 14.
 
Aaron Todd, CEO, stated, We are pleased that each of our operating divisions experienced strong earnings growth during the first quarter of 2009.  In addition to the benefit of reduced fuel prices and improved reimbursement from recent price increases, our strategy to reduce costs of operations through fleet replacement initiatives and base consolidations has produced significant improvements in our operating margins.  The recent improvement in Same-Base Transports in March and April, as compared with more recent months, is also very encouraging and approximates levels achieved before the economic slowdown.  While patient flight volumes, reimbursement levels, and maintenance expenditures experience inherent fluctuation in any given quarter, these recent positive trends offer justification for an optimistic outlook.
 
 
The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern. Interested parties can access the call by dialing (877) 883-0656 (domestic) or (706) 643-8826 (international) or by accessing the web cast at .

For the quarter, revenue increased slightly from $128.0 million to $128.1 million in the current-year quarter.  For the six-month period, revenue increased 3% to 252.8 million, compared with $246.1 million in the prior-year six-month period.
 
For the quarter, net income increased 79% to $8.7 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, as compared with prior-year quarter net income of $4.8 million, or $0.38 per diluted share.  Net income for the six-month period increased 90% to $13.6 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, compared to $7.2 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, for the prior-year six-month period.
 
The increase in net income was primarily attributed to decreases in fuel and maintenance expenditures which improved margins in both services divisions, as well as to reductions in general and administrative costs.  In addition, the current-year quarter benefited from improved contributions from revenue growth within the Products Division.   Maintenance expense decreased by $3.0 million or 13%, while maintenance expense per flight hour decreased by 9% to $561 as compared with the prior-year quarter.  Fuel expense decreased $2.7 million or 49% during the quarter, while fuel costs per patient transport decreased 42% to $241 compared with the prior-year quarter.  Second quarter general and administrative costs decreased by $2.4 million, or 14%, due to non-recurrence of Federal Aviation Administration operating certificate consolidation costs incurred in the prior-year quarter and efficiencies achieved through reorganization and consolidation of field and corporate overhead functions.  Contribution to pre-tax earnings from external revenue within the Products Division increased by $0.9 million during the quarter, as compared with the prior-year period.  The current year quarter included pre-tax gains on disposition of aircraft of $0.6 million, compared with $0.1 million in the prior-year period.
 
For the second quarter, community-based revenue decreased 8% to $71.8 million compared to $77.9 million in the prior year, while segment net income increased 3% to $11.5 million from $11.2 million.  Total community-based patient transports were 10,414, as compared with 11,638 in the prior-year quarter.  Community-based patient transports for bases open greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) decreased 9%, or 922 patient transports, as compared with the prior-year quarter.  Weather cancellations for these same base locations increased by 307 compared with the prior-year quarter.   Net revenue per community-based transport was $6,969 for the current-year quarter, compared with $6,727 in the prior-year quarter, a 4% increase.  Hospital-based revenue increased 7% to $50.5 million compared to $47.0 million in the prior-year period, while segment net income increased to $5.4 million from $1.1 million.  External revenue within the Products Division increased $2.7 million, or 85%, compared with the prior-year quarter.
 
The Company also provided an update on July 2009 flight volume.  Total community-based transports were 3,867 during July 2009 compared with 3,760 in July 2008, a 3% increase.  Daily average community-based transports in July 2009 represent a 6% increase over the daily average in June 2009.   Same-Base Transports during the month of July increased by 31 transports, or 1%, as compared with July 2008, while weather cancellations decreased by 141 as compared with the prior-year month.
 
Aaron Todd, CEO, stated, We are obviously pleased with the continuation of strong growth in earnings through the second quarter of 2009.  Significant reductions in maintenance expenditures during our second quarter offer additional confirmation that our fleet rejuvenation efforts and conversion of twin-engine aircraft to more efficient single-engine helicopters are producing anticipated cost reductions.  Reductions in our administrative overhead during the economic downturn have contributed to improved net margins, as well.
 
 
 
 
Mr. Todd added, Although net revenue per community-based transport for the second quarter was slightly lower than our first quarter results, net revenue per transport for June 2009 was in-line with first quarter reimbursement levels.  July 2009 collections continued the healthy pace set in June, as well.  These strong July collections, combined with a 5% price increase in our gross charge structure effective July 1, should have a positive influence on our pending July net revenue per patient transport results.   Severe weather patterns during May and June contributed to higher weather cancellations, as well as reduced overall demand.  We are pleased by the improved patient flight volumes in July with the return of more moderate summer weather patterns.

The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company
 
DENVER, CO., November 5, 2009  Air Methods Corporation (NasdaqGS: AIRM) reported results for the quarter ended September 30, 2009.  Revenue increased 3% to $137.6 million from $133.8 million in the year-ago quarter.  For the nine-month period, revenue increased 3% to $390.4 million, up from $379.9 million in the prior-year nine-month period.  The prior-year quarter and nine-month period included $7.3 million in revenue generated from hurricane response activities, as compared with no revenue from such activities during the current-year periods.  Excluding revenue generated from hurricane response activities in the prior-year periods, revenue increased 9% and 5% for the quarter and nine-month period ended September 30, 2009, respectively.
 
For the quarter, net income increased 51% to $12.6 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, as compared with prior-year quarter net income of $8.4 million, or $0.67 per diluted share.  Net income for the nine-month period increased 69% to $26.2 million, or $2.12 per diluted share, compared to $15.5 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, for the prior-year period.  The current-year and prior-year quarters included pre-tax net gains on disposition of assets of $0.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively.
 
Third Quarter Highlights
 
  Revenue from Community-Based Services decreased 3% to $80.2 million from $82.6 million, while segment net income increased 4% to $18.3 million during the third quarter, as compared with segment net income of $17.5 million in the prior-year quarter.  The decrease in revenue is entirely attributed to the absence of hurricane response revenue in the current-year quarter.  Excluding the hurricane response revenue generated in the prior-year quarter, Community-Based Services revenue increased 7%.  Total community-based patient transports increased slightly to 10,752 in the current-year quarter from 10,690 in the prior-year quarter.  Community-based patient transports for bases open greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) decreased 2% or 171 transports, as compared with the prior-year quarter.  Weather cancellations for these same-base locations increased by 220 compared with the prior-year quarter.
Community-Based Services:
 
The increase in segment net income is attributed to improved net revenue per community-based transport, combined with lower maintenance and fuel expenditures.  Net revenue per community-based transport increased 7% to $7,509, compared with $7,047 in the prior-year quarter.  Divisional maintenance expense decreased by $1.6 million over the prior-year quarter, reflecting an 18% decrease in cost per flight hour.  In addition, fuel expense decreased by $2.1 million over the prior-year quarter, reflecting a 41% decrease per hour flown.  The improvement in net revenue per community-based transport is attributed to recent price increases, while reduction in maintenance expenditures is attributed to fleet rejuvenation activities and converting several twin-engine helicopters to more efficient single-engine aircraft.  Decrease in fuel expense reflects reduced cost per gallon.
 
  Revenue from Hospital-Based Services increased by 6% to $51.6 million from $48.6 million, while segment net income increased to $5.3 million in the current-year quarter from $0.4 million during the prior-year third quarter.  The increase in segment net income is primarily attributed to decreased maintenance expenses and improved pricing from renewed contracts.  Maintenance expense for the quarter decreased by $4.3 million, reflecting a 21% decrease in cost per flight hour.  This reduction in expense is attributed to the same factors discussed above within the Community-Based Services segment.
Hospital-Based Services:
 
 
 
 
Revenue, excluding revenue generated from internal projects, increased to $5.9 million from $2.7 million in the prior-year quarter.  Segment net income, excluding internal projects, increased to $1.8 million from $0.7 million in the prior-year quarter.
Products Division:  
 
The Company also provided an update on October 2009 flight volume.  Total community-based transports   during October 2009 were 3,065 compared with 3,495 during October 2008.  Same-Base Transports decreased 489 transports or 15%, while weather cancellations for these same bases increased by 636 transports.  Weather cancellations almost doubled as compared with the prior-year month, reflecting very severe weather conditions.
 
Aaron Todd, Chief Executive Officer, stated, We are pleased with the continued strength in our financial performance through the third quarter of 2009.  Despite more severe weather and the lack of hurricane response activities in the current-year quarter compared with the prior-year quarter, the Company has achieved strong earnings growth.  Our cost reduction initiatives continue to improve our operating margins and our fleet rejuvenation and conversion activities will be ongoing throughout future periods.  Our strong cash flows from operating activities of $52 million has allowed the Company to repay its line of credit in full, while also providing liquidity to finance aircraft purchases and safety technology upgrades.  Although we experienced our most severe weather month of the entire year during October, our Same-Base Transports would have increased by over 4% absent the increase in weather cancellations.
 
The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern.  Interested parties can access the call by dialing (877) 883-0656 (domestic) or (706) 643-8826 (international) or by accessing the web cast at .

On January 26, 2010, Air Methods Corporation (the "Company") provided an update on anticipated financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2009. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report.

EXHIBIT 99.1
DENVER, Jan. 26, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Air Methods Corporation (Nasdaq:AIRM), the largest air medical transportation company in the world, provided an update on fourth quarter 2009 preliminary results.
Based on preliminary 2009 fourth quarter results, total community-based patient transports were 9,015. Patients transported for community bases in operation greater than one year decreased 799 transports, or 9%, while weather cancellations for these same bases increased by 781 compared with the prior-year quarter. In addition to the increased weather cancellations, requests for community-based service during the month of December decreased by 11% compared with the prior year for bases open greater than one year. The December decrease in requests for service was attributed to the impact of weather, such as cold and snowy conditions, which further reduced need for service. For the five previous months, requests for service for these bases increased 3% when compared with the same period in 2008. Flight volume within the hospital-based operations experienced similar decreases during the quarter.   
Preliminary net revenue per community-based transport was just slightly below the third quarter 2009 rate of $7,509 per transport. Preliminary maintenance costs per flight hour were consistent with the prior-year fourth quarter rate per hour.      
The Company noted that these preliminary results are subject to final year-end closing and independent audit procedures and are therefore subject to change. 
Aaron Todd, CEO, stated, "Although the increased weather severity significantly impacted our fourth quarter results, all of the remaining key operating measures have been in-line with expectations. Our fourth quarter net earnings will not reflect growth compared with the prior-year quarter; however, our preliminary 2009 annual results still represent significant growth in earnings compared with the previous year. While weather fluctuations have always represented a key variable in our net revenue, the severity experienced during our fourth quarter is significantly above the historical average for weather cancellations, and therefore, should moderate in future periods."

EXHIBIT 99.1
DENVER, March 11, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Air Methods Corporation (Nasdaq:AIRM), the largest air medical transportation company in the world, reported revenue and net income for the year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009.
For the year, revenue increased 2% to $510.6 million compared to $498.8 million in the prior year. Net income increased 50% from $19.3 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, in the prior year to $29.0 million, or $2.33 per diluted share, in the current year. Prior-year revenue included $7.7 million related to hurricane-response services provided under a contract with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. No such revenue was generated in 2009. Current-year results include pre-tax gains from the disposition of assets of $0.6 million, compared with pre-tax gains of $2.9 million in the prior year.     
For the fourth quarter, revenue increased 1% to $120.2 million as compared with $118.9 million during the prior-year period. Net income decreased 27% to $2.7 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to net income of $3.7 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, in the prior-year period.  As previously announced, current-year fourth quarter results were negatively impacted by higher weather cancellations of patient transports associated with very severe weather experienced throughout the country. The current-year fourth quarter includes a pre-tax loss of $0.2 million from the disposition of assets, compared with a gain of $0.3 million in the prior-year quarter.
During the fourth quarter of 2009, total patients transported within community-based operations were 9,015, as compared with 9,496 during the prior-year quarter, a 5% decrease. Patients transported for community bases in operation greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) decreased by 799 transports, or 9%, while weather cancellations for these same bases increased by 781 transports compared with the prior-year period. Revenue per community-based transport increased 4% from $7,156 in the prior-year quarter to $7,472 in the current-year quarter. Consolidated maintenance expense per flight hour was mostly unchanged at $618 per hour during the current-year quarter, compared with $614 per flight hour in the prior-year quarter. Fuel expense per community-based transport decreased by 7% to $306 per transport in the current-year quarter compared with $330 per transport in the prior-year quarter.
Community-Based Services divisional revenue and segment net income decreased by 1% to $67.2 million and by 19% to $5.2 million in the current-year quarter, respectively. Hospital-Based Services divisional revenue and segment net income increased by 2%, to $48.2 million, and by 153% to $3.9 million, respectively, compared with the prior-year quarter. Excluding internal revenue, the products division increased revenue by 21% to $4.8 million, while external segment net income decreased 42% to $0.6 million compared with the prior-year period.  
The Company also provided an update on first quarter 2010 operations to-date. Same-Base Transports within community-based operations through February were down 863 patient transports, or 15%, as compared with the prior-year period, while weather cancellations for these same bases increased 660 as compared with the prior-year period. Requests for community-based services at bases open greater than one year also decreased by 8% primarily attributed to the very severe weather conditions.  Total community-based patient transports for the two-month period were 5,319, as compared with 5,936, in the prior-year period. 
Aaron Todd, CEO of Air Methods, commented, "The strong growth in net earnings achieved in 2009 reflects benefits from continued fleet rejuvenation and conversions from twin-engine to single-engine aircraft. In addition, decreased fuel prices, combined with improved net reimbursement per community-based transport, also contributed to overall earnings growth. While this winter has been very severe to-date, we would anticipate a recovery in flight volume as weather returns to more moderate levels."
The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern. Interested parties can access the call by dialing (877) 883-0656 (domestic) or (706) 643-8826 (international) or by accessing the web cast at www.airmethods.com.

EXHIBIT 99.1
DENVER, April 27, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Air Methods Corporation (Nasdaq:AIRM), the largest air medical transportation company in the world, provided an update on first quarter 2010 preliminary results.
Based on preliminary 2010 first quarter results, total community-based patient transports were 8,592. Patients transported for community bases in operation greater than one year decreased 1,238 transports or 13%, while weather cancellations for these same bases increased by 635 transports compared with the prior-year quarter. In addition to the increased weather cancellations, requests for community-based service decreased by 8% for bases open greater than one year, partially attributed to the effect of the more severe weather on overall need for service.  Preliminary net revenue per community-based transport was $7,621, as compared with $7,305 in the prior-year quarter, a 4% increase. 
Preliminary maintenance expense increased $1.9 million, or 10%, as compared with the prior-year quarter, despite a decrease in total flight hours of 14%. The increase was attributed to a total of 20 major maintenance events, such as engine and transmission overhauls, during the quarter as compared with 11 in the prior-year quarter.   
As a result of the lower flight volumes and higher maintenance expenses, the company expects to report near breakeven results for first quarter 2010 net earnings.  The Company noted that these preliminary results are subject to final quarter-end closing and review procedures and are therefore subject to change. 
Aaron Todd, CEO, stated, "While we are disappointed by the weak patient flight volumes and very high maintenance expenditures experienced during our first quarter, current-month community-based patient flight volume through April 25 projects a return to growth in total transports as compared with the prior-year month. This improvement is attributed to more moderate weather conditions. Maintenance costs per flight hour during the quarter were unusually high; and therefore, we would anticipate moderation in this key measure in future periods. We are pleased that our recent price increases continue to improve net reimbursement, especially considering the reduction in percentage of patients transported during the past year who have private insurance. To further offset this trend, we have implemented a 5% supplemental price increase effective April 1, in addition to our normal annual price adjustments."
th
st
The Company will report financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2010 after the close of the market on Thursday, May 6, 2010.

EXHIBIT 99.1
DENVER, May 6, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Air Methods Corporation (Nasdaq:AIRM), the largest air medical transportation company in the world, reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 and provided an update on April 2010 flight volumes. For the quarter, revenue decreased 5% to $118.5 million from $125.4 million in the prior-year quarter. Net income for the first quarter of 2010 was $0.1 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared with net income of $5.0 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2009. As previously announced, the decrease in net income was primarily attributed to lower patient flight volumes associated with increased weather severity and to higher maintenanc e expenditures.
Community-based patient transports were 8,592 during the current-year quarter, compared with 9,432 in the prior-year quarter, a 9% decrease. Patients transported for community bases in operation greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) decreased by 14% or 1,238 transports, while weather cancellations for these same bases increased by 635 transports compared with the prior-year quarter. Requests for community-based service decreased 9% for bases open greater than one year, partially attributed to the effect of the more severe weather on overall need for service. Flight volume within hospital-based operations also declined 11% as compared with the prior-year quarter. Net revenue per community-based transport increased 4% from $7,305 to $7,621 in the current-year quarter despite a decrease in insured patients from 43% to 36% of total community-based transports, as compared with the prior-year quarter. Approximately half of this percentage decrease moved to Medicare coverage, with t he other half to Medicaid.    
Maintenance expense increased $1.9 million or 12% compared with the prior-year quarter, despite a 15% decline in flight hours. This increase was primarily attributed to a near doubling of major maintenance events during the quarter, as compared with the first quarter of 2009. Fuel expense increased by $0.2 million to $3.0 million compared with the prior-year quarter, reflecting a 19% increase per hour flown.
For the first quarter, community-based divisional revenue decreased 4% to $66.7 million, compared to $69.2 million in the prior year, while segment net income decreased to $0.9 million from $7.9 million. Hospital-based divisional revenue decreased 1% to $48.0 million from $48.6 million in the prior-year period, while segment net income remained mostly unchanged at $4.0 million compared with $4.1 million in the prior-year quarter. Products Division's external revenue decreased 49% to $3.9 million compared with $7.6 million in the prior-year quarter, while its external segment net income decreased by $1.3 million as compared with the prior year. External backlog within the Products Division has increased to $23.8 million at the end of the quarter, compared with $15.1 million at the beginning of the fiscal year, and $12.4 million at the end of the prior-year first quarter.     
The Company also provided an update on April 2010 flight volume. Total community-based transports were 3,478 during April 2010 compared with 3,453 in April 2009. April 2010 Same-Base Transports decreased by 139 transports, or 4%, as compared with April 2009. Weather cancellations during April 2010 for these same bases decreased 220, as compared with the prior-year month. 
Aaron Todd, CEO, stated, "We are pleased that more moderate weather in April has improved our total community-based patient flight volume, even though Same-Base Transports still reflected a decrease. April flight volume in the prior year exceeded the average monthly volume for May and June 2009, which was unusual. As a result, if moderate weather conditions continue through May and June of the current year, we would anticipate greater growth in total transports and potentially a return to growth in Same-Base Transports during the remainder of the second quarter. Our net revenue per community-based transport during the first quarter of 2010 was 9% higher than the second quarter of 2009 and does not yet reflect any net benefit from the April 2010 price increase. Accordingly, we would anticipate healthy percentage growth during the second quarter in our net reimbursement per patient transport, as well. Finally, we anticipate greatly improved performance in our Products Division net results, as m uch of the increased backlog is expected to be recognized during the remainder of 2010."
The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern.

(b)           .  If (i) the Executive is a specified person on the date of the Executives separation from service within the meaning of Sections 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) and 409A(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the Code, and (ii) as a result of such separation from service the Executive would receive any payment under (x) Section 7(a) in connection with an involuntary termination other than for Cause, or (y) Section 8 that, absent the application of this paragraph, would be subject to the interest and additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A(a) of the Code as a result of the application of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then such payment shall be made within five (5) business days of, but in no event earlier than, the date that is the earlier of: (iii) 6 months after the Executives separation from service or (iv) the Executives date of death, except to the extent that such payment constitutes a payment under a separation pay plan following an involuntary separation from service (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(n)) that does not provide for a deferral of compensation by reason of the application of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii).

Termination

In the event that a Change of Control of the Company, as hereinafter defined, occurs, and the Executives employment by the Company, or a successor to the business of the Company, is terminated by the Company or the successor in connection with, or within one year after, the occurrence of such Change of Control, or if, after a Change of Control, the Executive terminates his employment as a result of a constructive termination of his employment by the Company or such successor, the Executive shall be entitled for a period of two (2) years following such termination or constructive termination, to receive compensation at an a nnual rate equal to the Executives highest cash compensation received during any 12-month period of his employment, payable on each regularly scheduled payroll date of the Company.. For purposes of this Section, a constructive termination by the Company or its successor shall be deemed to occur if the Executive is assigned to another position, not comparable in terms of salary, duties, status or authority, or substantially reducing the Executives job responsibilities and authority from the position, responsibilities and/or authority held by the Executive prior to the Change of Control, or if the Executives place of work shall be moved more than 75 miles from the Executives place of work with the Company prior to the Change of Control.  For purposes of this Section 8, a Change of Control shall be deemed to have occurred in the event that a merger, sale of assets, sale or exchange of stock, or other corporate reorganization occurs with another corporatio n or other entity, following which and as a result of which, at least 50% of the ownership interest of the surviving corporation is held by persons other than the shareholders of the Company prior to such transaction, or a majority of the directors of the surviving corporation are persons other than the directors of the Company prior to such transaction.  Any notice by the Executive to the Company or its successor claiming a constructive termination of the Executive shall specify the claimed default by the Company or the successor and the Company or its successor shall have ninety (90) days to make such modifications in the Executives working relationship as to overcome the constructive termination.  The term constructive termination for purposes of this Section 8 is intended to have the same meaning as a separation from service for good reason as described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(n)(2) and no constructive termination shall be deemed to h ave occurred unless the termination would be an involuntary separation from service pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(n)(2).

9.             .  The Company shall, to the full extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify the Executive and hold him harmless if he is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, by reason of the fact that the Executive is or was an officer and employee of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonab ly incurred by the Executive in connection with such action, suit or proceeding so long as the Executive acted in good faith and in a manner that he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company shall pay such expenses of the Executive in advance of the final disposition of such action upon satisfying such conditions as may be imposed by law with respect to such advances.
Indemnification
10.             During the continuance of his employment by the Company and for a period of six (6) months after termination (if such termination occurs on or before May 31, 2011), or for twelve (12) months after termination of his employment (if such termination occurs on or after June 1, 2011), the Executive shall not, anywhere in the United States, engage in any business which competes directly or indirectly with the Company.

During his employment by the Company, and for a period of five years thereafter, the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, use, disseminate, or disclose for any purpose other than for the purposes of the Companys business, any of the Companys confidential information or trade secrets, unless such disclosure is compelled in a judicial proceeding.  Upon termination of his employment, all documents, records, notebooks, and similar repositories of records containing information relating to any trade secrets or confidential information then in the Executives possession or control, whether prepared by him or by others , shall be left with the Company or returned to the Company upon its request.
Trade Secrets and Confidential Information
12.           .  It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of Sections 10 and 11 shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.  Accordingly, if any particular sentence or portion of either Section 10 or 11 shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions of such section nevertheless shall continue to be valid and enforceable as though the invalid portions were not a part thereof.  In the event that any of the provisions of Section 10 relating to the geographic areas of restriction or the period of restriction shal l be deemed to exceed the maximum area or period of time which a court of competent jurisdiction would deem enforceable, the geographic areas and times shall, for the purposes of this Agreement, be deemed to be the maximum areas or time periods which a court of competent jurisdiction would deem valid and enforceable in any state in which such court of competent jurisdiction shall be convened.

If (i) the Executive is a specified person on the date of the Executives separation from service within the meaning of Sections 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) and 409A(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the Code, and (ii) as a result of such separation from service the Executive would receive any payment under (x) Section 7(a) in connection with an involuntary termination other than for Cause, or (y) Section 8 that, absent the application of this paragraph, would be subject to the interest and additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A(a) of the Code as a result of the application of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then such payment shall be made within five (5) business days of, but in no event earlier than, the date that is the earlier of: (iii) 6 months after the Executives separation from service or (iv) the Executives date of death, except to the extent that such payment constitutes a payment under a separation pay plan following an involuntary separation from service (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(n)) that does not provide for a deferral of compensation by reason of the application of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii).  For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that this Section 7(b) shall be interpreted so that the Executive will receive payments under (i) Section 7(a) in connection with an involuntary termination other than for Cause, or (ii) Section 8 during the six month period specified in this Section 7(b) to the maximum extent permitted by Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii).

Any notice by the Executive to the Company or its successor claiming a constructive termination of the Executive shall specify the claimed default by the Company or the successor and the Company or its successor shall have ninety (90) days to make such modifications in the Executives working relationship as to overcome the constructive termination.  The term constructive termination for purposes of this Section 8 is intended to have the same meaning as a separation from service for good reason as described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(n)(2) and no constructive termination shall be deemed to ha ve occurred unless the termination would be an involuntary separation from service pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(n)(2).

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company shall pay such expenses of the Executive in advance of the final disposition of such action upon satisfying such conditions as may be imposed by law with respect to such advances.
Indemnification

Covenant Not to Compete.
11.           .

Upon termination of his employment, all documents, records, notebooks, and similar repositories of records containing information relating to any trade secrets or confidential information then in the Executives possession or control, whether prepared by him or by others , shall be left with the Company or returned to the Company upon its request.
Trade Secrets and Confidential Information
12.           .  It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of Sections 10 and 11 shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.  Accordingly, if any particular sentence or portion of either Section 10 or 11 shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions of such section nevertheless shall continue to be valid and enforceable as though the invalid portions were not a part thereof.  In the event that any of the provisions of Section 10 relating to the geographic areas of restriction or the period of restriction shal l be deemed to exceed the maximum area or period of time which a court of competent jurisdiction would deem enforceable, the geographic areas and times shall, for the purposes of this Agreement, be deemed to be the maximum areas or time periods which a court of competent jurisdiction would deem valid and enforceable in any state in which such court of competent jurisdiction shall be convened.

EXHIBIT 99.1
DENVER, Aug. 5, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Air Methods Corporation (Nasdaq:AIRM), the largest air medical transportation company in the world, reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2010 and provided an update on July 2010 community-based patient transports. For the quarter, revenue increased 8% from $129.0 million to $139.2 million in the current-year quarter. For the six-month period, revenue increased 1% to $257.7 million, compared with $254.4 million in the prior-year six-month period. 
For the quarter, net income increased 47% to $12.8 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, as compared with prior-year second quarter net income of $8.7 million, or $0.70 per diluted share. Net income for the six-month period decreased 6% to $12.9 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared to $13.6 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, for the prior-year six-month period. The increase in quarterly net income was primarily attributed to an increase in net revenue per community-based patient transport and lower maintenance expense per flight hour. The current-year quarter includes a pre-tax gain on disposition of assets of $0.1 million, compared with a pre-tax gain of $0.6 million in the prior-year quarter. 
For the second quarter, community-based revenue increased 19% to $86.6 million compared to $72.7 million in the prior year, while segment net income increased 77% to $20.4 million from $11.5 million. Total community-based patient transports increased to 10,507, as compared with 10,414 in the prior-year quarter. Community-based patient transports for bases open greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) decreased 2%, or 246 patient transports, as compared with the prior-year quarter. Weather cancellations for these same base locations decreased by 385 compared with the prior-year quarter. Net revenue per community-based transport was $8,181 for the current-year quarter, compared with $6,969 in the prior-year quarter, a 17% increase. This increase was attributed to recent price increases, as well as weakness in collections experienced in the prior-year quarter which reduced the net revenue per transport by 5% compared with the 2009 average.   Hospital-based revenue decreas ed by 3% to $49.1 million compared to $50.5 million in the prior-year period, while segment net income decreased 5% to $5.1 million from $5.4 million. External revenue within the Products Division decreased $2.4 million, or 40%, compared with the prior-year quarter.   Consolidated maintenance expense decreased by 3% per flight hour, contributing to an overall decline in expense of $0.7 million, as compared with the prior-year quarter.      
The Company also provided an update on July 2010 flight volume. Total community-based transports were 3,642 during July 2010 compared with 3,867 in July 2009, a 6% decrease. Daily average community-based transports in July 2010 represent a 2% decrease over the daily average in June 2010.   Same-Base Transports during the month of July decreased by 398 transports, or 10%, as compared with July 2009, while weather cancellations decreased by 27 as compared with the prior-year month. Prior-year July community-based patient transports were 7% higher than the next highest month in 2009, creating a strong prior-year comparative for the month.  
Aaron Todd, CEO, stated, "We are obviously pleased to see a return to strong earnings growth following the severe winter which impacted the previous two quarters. The reduction in maintenance expenditures promotes confidence that the hourly rate experienced during the first quarter of this year was unusually high. We were pleased to see the payer mix for community-based patient transports stabilize during the current quarter from percentages experienced during the first quarter of 2010. Even with the increase in net revenue per community-based transports, our days' sales outstanding decreased to 83 days as of June 30, 2010, compared with 109 days as of June 30, 2009. While our Products Division experienced a sharp decline in external revenue, the division enjoys a $21 million backlog as of June 30 which is expected to improve financial results over the coming quarters."

EXHIBIT 99.1
DENVER, Nov. 4, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Air Methods Corporation (Nasdaq:AIRM) reported results for the quarter ended September 30, 2010. Revenue increased 11% to $153.9 million from $138.6 million in the year-ago quarter. For the nine-month period, revenue increased 5% to $411.6 million, up from $393.0 million in the prior-year nine-month period. For the quarter, net income increased 48% to $18.6 million, or $1.48 per diluted share, as compared with prior-year quarter net income of $12.6 million, or $1.01 per diluted share. Net income for the nine-month period increased 20% to $31.5 million, or $2.51 per diluted share, compared to $26.2 million, or $2.12 per diluted share, for the prior-year period.
Third Quarter Highlights
Revenue from Community-Based Services increased 18% to $96.1 million from $81.2 million, while segment net income increased 48% to $27.0 million during the third quarter, as compared with segment net income of $18.3 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase in revenue and related earnings is attributed to improved net revenue per community-based transport. Net revenue per community based transport increased 16% to $8,720, compared with $7,509 in the prior-year quarter. Total community-based patient transports increased slightly to 10,876 in the current-year quarter from 10,752 in the prior-year quarter. Community-based patient transports for bases open greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) decreased 5% or 487 transports, as compared with the prior-year quarter. Weather cancellations for these same-base locations decreased by 321 compared with the prior-year quarter.  Improvement in segment earnings was offset, partially, by increases in maintenance expenditures. Maintenance expense for the quarter increased by $3.9 million, reflecting a 31% increase in cost per flight hour. This increase was attributed to higher overall major overhauls or replacements of key components during the quarter as compared with the prior-year quarter.  
Community-Based Services:
 Revenue from Hospital-Based Services decreased by 2% to $50.6 million from $51.6 million, while segment net income decreased by 15% to $4.5 million in the current-year quarter from $5.3 million during the prior-year third quarter. The decrease in segment revenue is partially attributed to conversion of Hospital-Based Services to Community-Based Services. These conversions resulted in a net reduction to segment revenue of $0.8 million or approximately half of the decrease. The decrease in segment net income is primarily attributed to increased maintenance expenditures. Maintenance expense for the quarter increased by $1.0 million, reflecting an 11% increase in cost per flight hour. This increase in expense is attributed to the same factors discussed above within the Community-Based Services segment. 
Hospital-Based Services:
Revenue, excluding revenue generated from internal projects, increased to $7.3 million from $5.9 million in the prior-year quarter, a 24% increase. Segment net income, excluding internal projects, increased to $2.3 million from $1.8 million in the prior-year quarter.
Products Division: 
The Company also provided an update on preliminary October 2010 flight volume. Total community-based transports during October 2010 were 3,862 compared with 3,065 during October 2009, reflecting a 26% increase. Same-Base Transports increased 599 transports or 20%, while weather cancellations for these same bases decreased by 867 transports. Requests for transport within our community bases open greater than one year increased by 211, or 3%. 
Aaron Todd, Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are very pleased with our quarterly results, especially given the impact of higher maintenance expenditures and the absence of any hurricane response revenue typically realized during our third quarters. Our overall improvement in net revenue per transport has been achieved while also reducing our days' sales outstanding from 103 days to 84 days over the past twelve months. As expected, our net margins have improved within our Products Division compared to the first half of 2010, as much of the back log was weighted to the second half of the current year. Finally, our October flight volume results confirm the severe impact that weather had on our ability to transport patients last winter.   If weather conditions continue to be moderate, we would anticipate healthy growth in earnings from improved patient transport volume during our winter quarters."
The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern.

DENVER, March 10, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Air Methods Corporation (Nasdaq:AIRM), the largest air medical transportation company in the world, reported revenue and net income for the year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2010.

During the fourth quarter of 2010, total patients transported within community-based operations were 10,071, as compared with 9,015 during the prior-year quarter, a 12% increase. Patients transported for community bases in operation greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) increased by 630 transports, or 7%, while weather cancellations for these same bases decreased by 1,165 transports compared with the prior-year period. Revenue per community-based transport increased 23% from $7,472 in the prior-year quarter to $9,175 in the current-year quarter. Consolidated maintenance expense per flight hour increased by 18% to $727 per hour during the current-year quarter, compared with $618 per flight hour in the prior-year quarter. Fuel expense per community-based transport decreased by 6% to $288 per transport in the current-year quarter compared with $306 per transport in the prior-year quarter.

While growth in net revenue per community-based transport has contributed significantly to this growth, we are also encouraged by the recent growth experienced in Same-Base Transports during the last several months. During the first two months of 2011, this growth in transports has been in spite of higher weather cancellations.

EXHIBIT 99.1
DENVER, May 5, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Air Methods Corporation (Nasdaq:AIRM), the largest air medical transportation company in the world, reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 and provided an update on April 2011 flight volume. For the quarter, revenue increased 11% to $131.9 million from $118.5 million in the prior-year quarter. Net income for the first quarter of 2011 was $6.0 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, compared with net income of $0.1 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2010. The current-year quarter includes a pre-tax, non-cash gain of $1.0 million for the mark to market of a fuel derivative, compared with a pre-tax, non-cash loss of $0.2 million in the prior-year quarter.
Community-based patient transports were 8,875 during the current-year quarter, compared with 8,592 in the prior-year quarter, a 3% increase. Patients transported for community bases in operation greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) decreased by 1% or 114 transports, while weather cancellations for these same bases increased by 324 transports compared with the prior-year quarter. Requests for community-based service increased 3% for bases open greater than one year. Net revenue per community-based transport increased 16% from $7,621 to $8,837 in the current-year quarter reflecting current and prior-year price increases.
Maintenance expense decreased $0.6 million or 3% compared with the prior-year quarter, despite a 3% increase in flight hours. This improvement was attributed to benefit of fleet replacement activities and lower costs associated with major aircraft component overhauls or replacements. Fuel expense decreased by $0.4 million to $2.5 million compared with the prior-year quarter, reflecting a 13% decrease per hour flown due to fuel derivative gains and cash settlements.
For the first quarter, community-based divisional revenue increased 20% to $80.0 million, compared to $66.7 million in the prior year, while segment net income increased to $10.5 million from $0.9 million. Hospital-based divisional revenue decreased 4% to $46.1 million from $48.0 million in the prior-year period, while segment net income increased 3% to $4.1 million compared with $4.0 million in the prior-year quarter. Decrease in hospital-based divisional revenue was partially attributed to the conversion of three contracts to a community-based service subsequent to the first quarter of 2010. Products Division's external revenue increased 49% to $5.8 million compared with $3.9 million in the prior-year quarter, while its external segment net income increased by $1.5 million as compared with the prior-year quarter.
The Company also provided an update on preliminary April 2011 flight volume. Total community-based transports were 3,205 during April 2011 compared with 3,478 in April 2010. April 2011 Same-Base Transports decreased by 411 transports, or 12%, as compared with April 2010. Weather cancellations during April 2011 for these same bases increased by 411 compared with the prior-year month.
Aaron Todd, CEO, stated, "We are pleased with the strong start to our 2011 fiscal year, despite higher weather cancellations experienced within our flight operations. We are especially encouraged by the increase in requests for service for community-bases open greater than one year. Although weather was very severe in April 2011 compared with April 2010, weather cancellations in April 2010 were the second fewest of the entire year and were by far the fewest for the second quarter of 2010. We are also pleased to have experienced moderation in our maintenance expenditures, following higher than anticipated maintenance expense experienced during the previous year."
The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern. Interested parties can access the call by dialing (877) 883-0656 (domestic) or (706) 643-8826 (international), or by accessing the web cast at www.airmethods.com.

Omniflight provides air medical transport services throughout the United States and provides these services under both the community-based and hospital-based service delivery models, utilizing a fleet of approximately 100 helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. Omniflight is headquartered in Addison, Texas, with operations in 18 states involving over 75 base locations.
Air Methods will acquire Omniflight for an aggregate purchase price of $200 million in cash on a cash-free, debt-free basis, subject to working capital and other adjustments as provided in the Agreement.  Upon closing, Omniflight will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Air Methods. The Agreement has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies. The transaction is contingent upon clearance under the Hart-Scott Rodino Anti-Trust Improvements Act and certain other closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close in July 2011.
Omniflight generated unaudited consolidated revenue of $172 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011.  The Company expects to fund the purchase price through a new commercial bank credit facility.
Aaron Todd, CEO for Air Methods stated, We are excited and pleased to have this opportunity to unite these two industry leaders.  The operational efficiencies that this combination should create will allow both entities to maintain and enhance the quality of our services, while providing for a more competitive cost structure resulting from greater economies of scale.  The geographical service areas of both entities are very complementary and improve the combined entitys ability to maintain important resources closer to our customers and their communities.
Tom Leverton, CEO of Omniflight stated, Air Methods and Omniflight have long histories in the industry and, together, the two companies will bring even stronger service to local communities across the country.  We are confident this will bring benefits to the customers and employees of Omniflight and are thrilled at the opportunity to join Air Methods.

The Agent shall give each Lender, within one (1) Business Day of receipt of such notice, telefacsimile notice or telephonic notice (confirmed in writing) of such reduction.  Each such reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of the lesser of (x) at least $1,000,000 or (y) the entire remaining Total Revolving Credit Commitment, and shall permanently reduce the Total Revolving Credit Commitment.

For purposes of this subsection (i), "net proceeds" shall mean all proceeds received from the disposition of such assets less (A) any applicable taxes, reasonable costs of such disposition (including legal, title and recording tax expenses, investment banking fees, accountants fees and underwriting discounts and commissions), (B) any payments made by the Borrowers on any indebtedness which is secured by such assets pursuant to a Permitted Encumbrance upon or with respect to such assets, which Permitted Encumbrance is senior to the Security Interest, and (C) the amount of any reserves established in good faith by the board of directors (or managers) of such Borrower in respect of warranty and indemnification obligations relating to such asset disposition, provided, however that such reserves described in clause (C) shall not exceed in the aggregate 10% of the purchase price of such assets; and provided further that upon release of such reserves described in clause (C) in accordance with GAAP, such released amounts shall become "net proceeds" of such sale or disposition and shall be subject to the terms of this Section 2.2(d)(i).
(ii)           If any of the Collateral is lost or destroyed or taken by condemnation, the Borrowers shall prepay the Indebtedness in an aggregate amount equal to 100% to the net proceeds (including insurance payments) received by any Borrower, or any Consolidated Subsidiary, for such loss, destruction or condemnation that remain after deducting any amount reinvested in replacement assets within 180 days after receipt of such net proceeds.  For purposes of this subsection (ii), "net proceeds" shall mean all proceeds received from the disposition of such assets less any applicable taxes and any payments made by the Borrowers on any indebtedness which is secured by such assets pursuant to a Permitted Encumbrance upon or with respect to such assets, which Permitted Encumbrance is senior to the Security Interest.

(iv)           Any prepayment under this Section 2.2(d) shall be applied first to reduce the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan in the inverse order of maturities of payments thereunder, until the Term Loan is paid in full, and second to the Revolving Loans.
(e)           .  On the Second Closing Date, Borrowers shall choose to have the Term Loan accrue interest as a Base Rate Loan or a LIBOR Rate Loan (which, if chosen, also requires Borrowers to choose an Interest Period).  In the case of the LIBOR Rate Loan, upon the expiration of an Interest Period, in the absence of a new Interest Period Notice submitted to Agent not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the end of such Interest Period (which shall set forth the new Interest Period or state that the LIBOR Rate Loan is being converted to a Base Rate Loan), the LIBOR Rate Loan then maturing shall be automatically continued at the then current LIBOR Rate for an additional Interest Period equal to the expired Interest Period; provided, however, that if the Term Loan Maturity Date would fall within such subsequent Interest Period, the LIBOR Rate Loan then maturing shall be automatically converted to a Base Rate Loan.  At any time prior to the Term Loan Maturity Date, Borrowers may request to convert a Base Rate Loan to a LIBOR Rate Loan upon submission of a LIBOR Rate Notice to Agent at least three (3) Business Days prior to the effectiveness of such conversion.

(a)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement and provided all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(c) have been satisfied, upon notice to Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders and the Eligible Financial Institutions), Borrowers may, prior to the earlier of the Revolving Credit Maturity Date and the Term Loan Maturity Date, request on up to three occasions an increase in the Total Revolving Credit Commitment or the Term Loan Amount by a minimum amount of $15,000,000 on each occasion and not to exceed $50,000,000 in the aggregate (any such increase in the Term Loan Amount, an "Incremental Term Loan" and any such increase in the Revolving Credit Commitment an "Incremental Revolving Loan Commitment" and such loan an "Incremental Revolving Loan" and together with the Incremental Term Loan, each an "Incremental Loan"), provided that:
(i)           the final maturity date of any Incremental Term Loan shall be no earlier than the Term Loan Maturity Date;
(ii)           the Revolving Credit Maturity Date shall not be modified by the increase in the Revolving Credit Commitment with the Incremental Revolving Loan Commitment;
(iii)           the interest rate margins and, subject to clause (i) above, amortization with respect to any Incremental Term Loan, for any Incremental Loan shall be determined by the Borrowers and the Lenders under such Incremental Loan provided that if the interest rate margin in respect of any Incremental Loan exceeds the Applicable Margin for the Term Loan or the Revolving Loans, as applicable, then the Applicable Margin for Term Loan or the Revolving Loans, as applicable, shall be increased so that the interest rate margin in respect of such loan is equal to the interest rate margin for the Incremental Loan; and
(iv)           except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.3, the terms and conditions applicable to any Incremental Loan shall be generally consistent with the terms of the Term Loan, or Revolving Loan, as applicable, or as otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the Agent and the Borrower.
(b)           Each notice from Borrowers pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall set forth the requested amount and, subject to subsection (a) of this Section 2.3, proposed terms of the Incremental Loan, and (in consultation with Agent) shall specify the time period within which each Lender and each Eligible Financial Institution, is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than fifteen (15) Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the Lenders and the Eligible Financial Institutions).  No Lender shall be obligated to provide any Incremental Loan, unless it so agrees.   Each Lender shall notify Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to make the requested Incremental Loan, and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than its current Applicable Commitment Percentage of such Incremental Loan.  Any Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its commitment.  At such time, in accordance with Section 2.4, Borrowers and Agent may invite Eligible Financial Institutions to join this Agreement as Lenders hereunder for the portion of the Incremental Loan not taken by existing Lenders. Agent shall notify Borrowers and each Lender of the Lenders and Eligible Financial Institutions' responses to each request made hereunder. Agent and Borrowers shall determine the effective date (the "Increase Effective Date") and the final allocation of such increase.

(c)           Incremental Term Loans shall become Term Loans under this Agreement, and Incremental Revolving Loans shall become Revolving Loans under this Agreement pursuant to an amendment (an "Incremental Loan Amendment") to this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Transaction Documents.  Subject to Section 13.2, the Incremental Loan Amendment may, without the consent of Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Agent and the Borrower, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.3.
Any Lender may assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Commitment, Incremental Revolving Loan Commitment or Term Loan Commitment, and all or a portion of the Term Loan and the Revolving Loans at the time owing to it), and additional Lenders may join any Facility from time to time by executing and delivering an appropriate Assignment and Acceptance to each of the Lenders and to Borrowers, and otherwise complying with the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, each Lender hereby agrees that, with respect to any such  assignment (A) no such sale or assignment shall be for an amount of less than $5,000,000, (B) each such sale or assignment shall be made on terms and conditions which are customary in the industry at the time of the transaction, (C) Agent, Issuing Bank (with respect to the assignments of Revolving Loan only) and, in the absence of a Default or Event of Default that has occurred and is continuing at the time of assignment, Borrowers, must consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, to each such assignment to a Person that is not already a Lender under this Agreement, (D) except in connection with assignments from a Lender to an Affiliate of such Lender, the assigning Lender shall pay to Agent a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 and any out-of-pocket attorneys fees and expenses incurred by Agent in connection with any such sale or assignment, (E) Agent (to the extent its consent is required hereunder), Issuing Bank (to the extent its consent is required hereunder), the assigning Lender and the assignee Lender shall each have executed and delivered an Assignment and Acceptance, and (F) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Revolving Credit Commitment, Incremental Revolving Loan Commitment, Term Loan Commitment, Term Loan or Revolving Loan assigned.  After such sale or assignment has been consummated (x) the assignee Lender thereupon shall become a "Lender" for all purposes of this Agreement and (y) the assigning Lender shall have no further liability for funding the portion its Revolving Credit Commitment, Incremental Revolving Loan Commitment or Term Loan Commitment, as applicable, assumed by such other Lender.

As part of the Revolving Facility, Borrowers may, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, request Letters of Credit to be issued in an amount not to exceed the Total Letter of Credit Commitment and in the event and to the extent the Issuing Bank issues a Letter of Credit on behalf of a Borrower, the Total Revolving Credit Commitment shall be considered utilized by the amount of such Letter of Credit.  Amounts drawn under any Letter of Credit and honored by the Issuing Bank shall be denominated in United States Dollars and shall become an Advance under the Revolving Line of Credit in such amount, at such time and subject to the terms of this Agreement, whether or not any Event of Default has occurred.  All Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement shall reduce the amount available under the Total Revolving Credit Commitment.  At no time shall the aggregate amount of Letter of Credit Outstandings exceed the Total Letter of Credit Commitment; provided, however, that upon expiration or termination of any Letter of Credit, the Total Letter of Credit Outstandings shall be reduced and the Issuing Bank may determine to issue, or cause to be issued, additional Letters of Credit provided that, in connection with any such additional Letter of Credit, the Total Letter of Credit Commitment shall not be exceeded and the other terms and conditions set forth herein have been satisfied.  The Issuing Bank shall not be obligated to issue Letters of Credit with an expiration date that extends beyond the earlier of (a) 364 days after the date of issuance for standby letters of credit or 180 days after the date of issuance for trade and commercial letters of credit, and (b) fifteen (15) days prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date.  All of the Issuing Bank's terms and conditions for the issuance of a Letter of Credit must also be complied with by Borrowers prior to any such issuance.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 3.1, the Issuing Bank shall not be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit at a time when any other Lender is a Defaulting Lender, unless the Issuing Bank has entered into arrangements with the Borrowers or such Defaulting Lender or other Lenders which are satisfactory to the Issuing Bank to eliminate the Issuing Banks Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 4.4(b)) with respect to any such Defaulting Lender, including the delivery of cash collateral.
Any Borrower may from time to time request that the Issuing Bank issue a Letter of Credit by delivering to the Issuing Bank a Letter of Credit Application therefor, completed to the satisfaction of the Issuing Bank, and such other certificates, documents and other papers and information as the Issuing Bank may request.  Upon receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the Issuing Bank shall process such Letter of Credit Application and the certificates, documents and other papers and information delivered to it in connection therewith in accordance with its customary procedures and shall, subject to Section 3.1 and Article VII, promptly issue the Letter of Credit requested thereby (but in no event shall the Issuing Bank be required to issue any Letter of Credit earlier than three (3) Business Days after its receipt of the Letter of Credit Application therefor and all such other certificates, documents and other papers and information relating thereto) by issuing the original of such Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may be agreed by the Issuing Bank and such Borrower.  The Issuing Bank shall promptly furnish to such Borrower a copy of such Letter of Credit and promptly notify each Lender of the issuance and upon request by any Lender, furnish to such Lender a copy of such Letter of Credit and the amount of such Lenders participation therein.
 
26
 
 
In the event of any drawing under any Letter of Credit, the Borrowers agree to reimburse (either with the proceeds of a Revolving Loan as provided for in this Section or with funds from other sources), in same day funds, the Issuing Bank on each date on which the Issuing Bank notifies the Borrowers of the date and amount of a draft paid under any Letter of Credit for the amount of (a) such draft so paid and (b) any amounts referred to in Section 4.2(c) incurred by the Issuing Bank in connection with such payment.  Unless the Borrowers shall immediately notify the Issuing Bank that the Borrowers intend to reimburse the Issuing Bank for such drawing from other sources or funds, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have timely given a Borrowing Notice to the Agent requesting that the Lenders make a Revolving Loan consisting of a Base Rate Advance on such date in the amount of (a) such draft so paid and (b) any amounts referred to in Section 4.2(c) incurred by the Issuing Bank in connection with such payment, and the Lenders shall make a Revolving Loan consisting of a Base Rate Advance in such amount, the proceeds of which shall be applied to reimburse the Issuing Bank for the amount of the related drawing and costs and expenses.  Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to fund a Revolving Loan in accordance with this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any draft paid under a Letter of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including, without limitation, non-satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 2.1 or Article VII.  If the Borrowers have elected to pay the amount of such drawing with funds from other sources and shall fail to reimburse the Issuing Bank as provided above, the unreimbursed amount of such drawing shall bear interest at the rate which would be payable on any outstanding Base Rate Advances which were then overdue from the date such amounts become payable (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) until payment in full.
The Borrowers' obligations under this Article III (including, without limitation, the Reimbursement Obligation) shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any set off, counterclaim or defense to payment which any Borrower may have or have had against the Issuing Bank or any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit or any other Person.  Each Borrower also agrees that the Issuing Bank and the Lenders shall not be responsible for, and the Borrowers' Reimbursement Obligation under Section 3.3 shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among any Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred or any claims whatsoever of any Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee.  The Issuing Bank shall not be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or omissions caused by the Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final nonappealable judgment.  The Borrowers agree that any action taken or omitted by the Issuing Bank under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct shall be binding on the Borrowers and shall not result in any liability of the Issuing Bank or any Lender to the Borrowers.  The responsibility of the Issuing Bank to the Borrowers in connection with any draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit shall, in addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited to determining that the documents (including each draft) delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment are in conformity with such Letter of Credit.

To the extent that any provision of any Letter of Credit Application related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the provisions of this Article III, the provisions of this Article III shall apply.
Borrowers hereby expressly agree that Borrowers' obligations relating to any Letter of Credit are secured by the Collateral.

The obligations of the Agent hereunder are only those expressly set forth herein.  All notices, payments, fees or other documents or items received by Agent from Borrowers shall be for the benefit of the Lenders, and Agent shall promptly, after receipt, deliver any documents or pro rata portion of fees and payments to each Lender (except where, pursuant to this Agreement, any Lender is not entitled to any fee or payment or is entitled to a lesser or greater portion of any fee or payment).  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent shall not be required to take any action with respect to any Event of Default, except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

Each Lender, including KeyBank, shall, ratably based on its Applicable Commitment Percentage, indemnify the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers) against any reasonable cost or expense (including counsel fees and disbursements), or any claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such as result from the Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final nonappealable judgment) that the Agent may suffer or incur in connection with any of the Transaction Documents or any action taken or omitted by the Agent thereunder.

Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.

Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent.

Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Transaction Documents.  After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent.
(a)           Any Lender may make assignments of all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Commitment, Incremental Revolving Loan Commitment or Term Loan Commitment, and all or a portion of the Term Loan and the Revolving Loans at the time owing to it) in accordance with the procedure set forth in the definition thereof and Section 2.4, which shall include, in the circumstances set forth therein, consent of Borrowers.

64
 
 
Agent's rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral, in addition to those rights granted herein and in any other agreement between Borrowers and Lenders now or hereafter in effect, shall be those of a secured party under the UCC and under any other applicable law.
Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Agent may or, at the request of the Required Lenders, shall, at any time and from time to time, notify any or all Account Debtors (other than for any Account that is not Collateral) of the Security Interest and may direct such Account Debtors to make all payments on receivables directly to Agent.
Whenever Agent may take possession of the Collateral pursuant to Section 12.1, Agent may take possession of the Collateral on Borrowers' premises or may remove the Collateral, or any part thereof, to such other places as the Agent may, in its sole discretion, determine.  If requested by Agent, Borrowers shall assemble the Collateral and deliver it to Agent at such place as may be designated by Agent.
Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Agent may or, at the request of the Required Lenders, shall, demand, collect, and sue for all monies and proceeds due, or to become due, on the Accounts that constitute Collateral (in either Borrowers' or Lenders' name at the Agent's option) with the right to enforce, compromise, settle, or discharge any or all Accounts that constitute Collateral.  If Agent takes any action contemplated by this section with respect to any Account, Borrowers shall not exercise any rights with respect to such Account, except as consented to by Agent.
Borrowers grant to Agent a royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use any and all patents, trademarks, and trade names now or hereafter owned by or licensed to Borrowers (to the extent the terms of any such license permit a further license to Agent), including, without limitation, the items set forth on ), effective upon, and solely for the purpose of disposing of Inventory after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default.
Schedule 5.1(d
 
65
 
 
Borrowers hereby authorize Agent to file such financing statements relating to the Collateral without Borrowers' signature thereon as Agent may deem appropriate, and appoints Agent as Borrowers' attorney-in-fact to perform all other acts which Agent deems appropriate to perfect and continue the Security Interest and to protect, preserve, and realize upon the Collateral, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  Without limiting the foregoing, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, or at any other time,  if any event or circumstance with respect to the Borrowers shall occur such that the Agent in its reasonable discretion believes that the prospect of payment of all or any part of the Indebtedness or the performance by the Borrowers under the Transaction Documents is impaired or such event or circumstance may result in a Material Adverse Effect, Agent may take such action as is necessary to create and perfect the Security Interest in Unencumbered Aircraft; provided that the Agent shall give prompt written notice to the Borrowers upon taking such action.
Upon Borrowers' failure to perform any of its duties under the Transaction Documents, including, without limitation, the duty to obtain insurance as specified in Section 8.7, the Agent or the Required Lenders may, but shall not be obligated to, perform any or all such duties.
Without in any way requiring notice to be given in the following manner, Borrowers agree that any notice by Agent of sale, disposition, or other intended action hereunder, or in connection herewith, whether required by the UCC or otherwise, shall constitute reasonable notice to Borrowers if such notice is mailed by regular or certified mail, postage prepaid, at least ten (10) calendar days prior to such action, to Borrowers' address or addresses specified on the signature page hereof or to any other address which Borrowers have specified in writing to Agent as the address to which notices hereunder shall be given to Borrowers.
No course of dealing among Borrowers, Agent and Lenders and no delay or omission by Agent or Lenders in exercising any right or remedy under the Transaction Documents or with respect to any Indebtedness shall operate as a waiver thereof or of any other right or remedy, and no single or partial exercise thereof shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy.  All rights and remedies of Agent and Lenders are cumulative.
 
66
 
 
Agent and Lenders shall have no obligation to take, and Borrowers shall have the sole responsibility for taking, any and all steps to preserve rights against any and all Account Debtors and against any and all prior parties to any note, chattel paper, draft, trade acceptance, or other instrument for the payment of money covered by the Security Interest whether or not in Agent's or Lenders' possession.  Agent and Lenders shall not be responsible to Borrowers for loss or damage resulting from Agent's or Lenders' failure to enforce any Accounts or to collect any moneys due, or to become due, thereunder or other proceeds constituting Collateral hereunder.  Borrowers waive protest of any note, check, draft, trade acceptance, or other instrument for the payment of money constituting Collateral at any time held by Agent or Lenders on which Borrowers are in any way liable and waives notice of any other action taken by Agent or Lenders, including, without limitation, notice of Agent's or Lenders' intention to accelerate the Indebtedness or any part thereof.
Without limiting any other right of Lenders, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Agent or any Lender, at its sole election, may apply to the Indebtedness any and all property of any Borrower held by such Person in any capacity, and may exercise a right of setoff against any monies owed to such Person by any Borrower.  If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Term Loans, Revolving Loans, or participations in Letter of Credit Outstandings or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Term Loans, Revolving Loans and participations in Letter of Credit Outstandings and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Term Loans, Revolving Loans and participations in Letter of Credit Outstandings and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Term Loans, Revolving Loans and participations in Letter of Credit Outstandings and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in Letter of Credit Outstandings and Swingline Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to a Borrower or any Consolidated Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).  Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
 
67
 
 
The Borrowers agree to pay on demand all costs and expenses of the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, and amendment of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents, and the other documents to be delivered hereunder, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Agent with respect thereto and with respect to advising the Agent as to its rights and responsibilities under the Transaction Documents.  The Borrowers further agree to pay on demand all costs and expenses of the Agent and the other Lenders, if any (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), in connection with the enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings, or otherwise) of the Transaction Documents and the other documents to be delivered hereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrowers shall not be obligated to pay any expenses of the Agent that are incurred due to the failure of the Agent to act in accordance with this Agreement.
The Required Lenders shall have the authority to grant any consents or waivers or approve any amendments to the Transaction Documents; provided, however, that unanimous approval of the Lenders shall be required for any amendment for the purpose of any of the following:  (a) increases in the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitment or Term Commitment except in each case as provided in Section 2.3, (b) reductions of principal, interest or fees payable other than as permitted under Section 2.1(j), (c) extensions of scheduled maturities or times for payments, (d) the release of any Collateral, except in connection with sales of assets in accordance with the terms hereof, (e) any amendment to required voting percentages or related definitions, including without limitation the definition of "Required Lenders," or (f) any amendment to Section 4.8 or Section 12.11, to the extent such amendment would alter any current or future distribution or payment received by any Lender.
The rights and benefits of Lenders hereunder shall, if Lenders so agree, inure to any party acquiring any interest in the Indebtedness or any part thereof, provided such assignee is an Eligible Assignee and agrees in writing to be bound by the terms hereof.
Lenders and Borrowers, as used herein, shall include the successors or assigns of those parties, except that no Borrower shall have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein.
 
68
 
 
No modification, rescission, waiver, release, or amendment of any provision of this Agreement shall be made, except by a written agreement signed by Borrowers and the Required Lenders (except as otherwise provided in Section 13.2).
This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and by Lenders and Borrowers on separate counterparts, each of which, when so executed and delivered, shall be an original, but all of which shall together constitute one and the same Agreement.  A counterpart hereof executed and delivered by facsimile shall be effective as an original for all applicable purposes.
Any financial calculation to be made, all financial statements and other financial information to be provided, and all books and records to be kept in connection with the provisions of this Agreement, shall be in accordance with GAAP; provided, however, that in the event changes in GAAP after the First Closing Date shall be mandated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or any similar accounting body of comparable standing, or should be recommended by Borrowers' certified public accountants, to the extent such changes would affect any financial calculations to be made in connection herewith, such changes shall be implemented in making such calculations only from and after such date as Borrowers and Lenders shall have amended this Agreement to the extent necessary to reflect such changes in the financial and other covenants to which such calculations relate.
(a)           If after receipt of any payment of all, or any part of, the Indebtedness, Lenders are, for any reason, compelled to surrender such payment to any Person because such payment is determined to be void or voidable as a preference, an impermissible setoff, or a diversion of trust funds, or for any other reason, the Transaction Documents shall continue in full force and Borrowers shall be liable, and shall indemnify and hold Agent and Lenders harmless for, the amount of such payment surrendered.  The provisions of this section shall be and remain effective notwithstanding any contrary action which may have been taken by Agent or Lenders in reliance upon such payment, and any such contrary action so taken shall be without prejudice to Agent's or Lenders' rights under the Transaction Documents and shall be deemed to have been conditioned upon such payment having become final and irrevocable.  The provisions of this Section 13.8(a) shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents.
(b)           Borrowers agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Agent and Lenders from and against any and all liabilities, claims, damages, penalties, expenditures, losses, or charges, including, but not limited to, all costs of investigation, monitoring, legal representations, remedial response, removal, restoration, or permit acquisition, which may now, or in the future, be undertaken, suffered, paid, awarded, assessed, or otherwise incurred by Lenders as a result of the presence of, Release of, or threatened Release of Hazardous Substances on, in, under, or near the property owned, leased or operated by any Borrower or any Consolidated Subsidiary.  The liability of Borrowers under the covenants of this Section 13.8(b) is not limited by any exculpatory provisions in this Agreement or any other documents securing the Indebtedness and shall survive repayment of the Indebtedness or any transfer or termination of this Agreement regardless of the means of such transfer or termination.  Borrowers agree that neither Agent nor Lenders shall be liable to Borrowers or any Consolidated Subsidiary for the completeness or accuracy of any Environmental Report or the information contained therein.

(c)           Borrowers agree to pay, indemnify, and hold Agent and Lenders harmless from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses, or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, counsel and special counsel fees and disbursements in connection with any litigation, investigation, hearing, or other proceeding) with respect, or in any way related, to the existence, execution, delivery, enforcement, performance, and administration of this Agreement and any other Transaction Document (collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"), except to the extent that any of the foregoing arises out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party being indemnified, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final nonappealable judgment.  The provisions of this Section 13.8(c) shall survive repayment of the Indebtedness.
This Agreement is, and is intended to be, a continuing Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect until the full and final payment of all of the Indebtedness in immediately available funds and termination of all Revolving Credit Commitments and Term Loan Commitments.  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Borrowers may terminate this Agreement at any time by giving Lenders a written notice of termination within the time periods required in Sections and 2.1(j) and 2.2(c), upon the expiration of which time periods all outstanding Indebtedness shall be due and payable in full without presentation, demand, or further notice of any kind, whether or not all or any part of such Indebtedness is otherwise due and payable pursuant to the agreement or instrument evidencing same.  Lenders may terminate this Agreement immediately and without notice upon the occurrence of an Event of Default.  Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement or elsewhere to the contrary, the Security Interest, Lenders' rights and remedies under the Transaction Documents and Borrowers' obligations and liabilities under the Transaction Documents, shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect until all of the Indebtedness outstanding, or contracted or committed for (whether or not outstanding), together with interest accruing thereon after such notice, shall be finally and irrevocably paid in full.  No Collateral shall be released or financing statement terminated until such final and irrevocable payment in full of the Indebtedness in immediately available funds.  Thereafter, Lenders shall (at Borrowers' expense) release or terminate all security interests, liens and encumbrances held by Agent on the Collateral.

From time to time, Borrowers shall take such action and execute and deliver to Agent and/or Lenders such additional documents, instruments, certificates, and agreements as Agent and/or Lenders may reasonably request to effectuate the purposes of the Transaction Documents. In addition, promptly upon request by the Agent, the Borrowers shall (and, subject to the limitations hereinafter set forth, shall cause each of their Consolidated Subsidiaries to) take such additional actions as the Agent may reasonably require from time to time in order (a) to carry out more effectively the purposes of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, (b) to subject to the Security Interest created by any of the Transaction Documents any personal property of the Borrowers and each of the Consolidated Subsidiaries set forth in Article V hereof, (c) to perfect and maintain the validity, effectiveness and priority of any of the Transaction Documents and the Security Interest intended to be created thereby, and (d) to better assure, convey, grant, assign, transfer, preserve, protect and confirm to the Agent and Lenders the rights granted or now or hereafter intended to be granted to the Agent and Lenders under any Transaction Document or under any other document executed in connection therewith.

In connection with each pledge of stock and stock equivalents, the Borrowers shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Agent, irrevocable proxies and stock powers and/or assignments, as applicable, duly executed in blank.

If any provision of this Agreement is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such provision shall be ineffective in such jurisdiction only to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability, and such prohibition or unenforceability shall not invalidate the balance of such provision to the extent it is not prohibited or unenforceable nor render prohibited or unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

This Agreement, the Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference, and the other Transaction Documents constitute the entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and supersede all prior negotiations, understandings, and agreements between such parties with respect to such transactions, including, without limitation, those expressed in any commitment letter delivered by Agent or Lenders to Borrowers.
 
72
 
 
This Agreement, and the transactions evidenced hereby, shall be governed by, and construed under, the internal laws of the State of Colorado, without regard to principles of conflicts of law, as the same may from time to time be in effect, including, without limitation, the UCC.
Borrowers and Lenders agree that any action or proceeding to enforce, or arising out of, the Transaction Documents may be commenced in any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Colorado, and Borrowers and Lenders waive personal service of process and agree that a summons and complaint commencing an action or proceeding in any such court shall be properly served and shall confer personal jurisdiction if served by registered or certified mail to Borrowers or Lenders, as appropriate, or as otherwise provided by the laws of the State or the United States.

BORROWERS REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OR AGENT OF LENDERS HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT LENDERS WILL NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THIS RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL WAIVER.  BORROWERS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT LENDERS HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 13.20.
Oral agreements or commitments to loan money, extend credit or to forbear from enforcing repayment of a debt, including promises to extend or renew such debt, are not enforceable.  To protect Borrowers and Lenders from misunderstanding or disappointment, any agreements covering such matters are contained in the Transaction Documents, which are the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the parties hereto.
Each of the Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential); (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority; (c) to the extent  required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process; (d) to any other party to this Agreement; (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder; (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this section, to (i) any permitted assignee of or participant in any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, or (ii) any direct or indirect contractual counterparty or prospective counterparty (or such contractual counterparty's or prospective counterparty's professional advisor) to any credit derivative transaction relating to obligations of the Borrowers; (g) with the consent of the Borrowers; (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this section, or (ii) becomes available to the Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrowers; or (i) if the applicable Lender is an insurance company, to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any other similar organization to the extent requested in connection with a review of such Lender.  In addition, the Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement (but not about the Borrowers) to market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry, and service providers to the Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration and management of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.  For the purposes of this section, "Information" means all information received from Borrowers or any Consolidated Subsidiary relating to Borrowers or any Consolidated Subsidiary or its respective business, other than any such information that is available to Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by Borrowers or any Consolidated Subsidiary.  Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.
 
73
 
 
Each Lender that is subject to the Act (as hereinafter defined) and the Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into Law October 26, 2001)) (the "Act"), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrowers, which information includes the name and address of the Borrowers and other information that will allow such Lender or the Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrowers in accordance with the Act.
PATRIOT
(a)           Each Borrower agrees that its obligations and liabilities (including the Indebtedness) under this Agreement and all other Transaction Documents are joint and several obligations regardless of which Borrower receives the proceeds of the Transactions or the manner in which the Borrowers, the Agent or the Lenders account therefor in their respective records.  Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that, for purposes of the Transaction Documents, the Borrowers constitute a single integrated financial enterprise and that each receives a benefit from the availability of credit under this Agreement to each other Borrower.
(b)           Each Borrower acknowledges that it will enjoy significant benefits from the business conducted by the other Borrowers because of, , their combined ability to bargain with other Persons including without limitation, their ability to receive the credit extensions under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, which would not have been available to an individual Borrower acting alone.  Each Borrower has determined that it is in its best interest to procure the credit facilities contemplated hereunder, with the credit support of the other Borrowers as contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.
inter alia
 
74
 
(c)           The Agent and the Lenders have advised the Borrowers that they are unwilling to enter into this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and make available the credit facilities extended hereby or thereby to a Borrower unless the other Borrowers agree, among other things, to be jointly and severally liable for the due and proper payment of the Indebtedness of the other Borrowers under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.  Each Borrower has determined that it is in its best interest and in pursuit of its purposes that it so induce the Agent and the Lenders to extend credit pursuant to this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents (i) because of the desirability to each Borrower of the credit facilities hereunder and the interest rates and the modes of borrowing available hereunder; (ii) because a Borrower may engage in transactions jointly with other Borrowers; and (iii) because a Borrower may require, from time to time, access to funds under this Agreement for the purposes herein set forth.  Each Borrower, individually, expressly understands, agrees and acknowledges, that the credit facilities contemplated hereunder would not be made available on the terms herein in the absence of the collective credit of the Borrowers and the joint and several liability of all such Persons.  Accordingly, each Borrower individually acknowledges that the benefit of the accommodations made under this Agreement to the Borrowers as a whole constitutes reasonably equivalent value, regardless of the amount of the indebtedness actually borrowed by, advanced to, or the amount of credit provided to, any individual Borrower.
(d)           Notwithstanding anything herein, in the Notes or in any other Transaction Document to the contrary, in any action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state or federal bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if, as a result of applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, including Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or any applicable provisions of comparable state law (collectively, "Fraudulent Transfer Laws"), the obligations of a Borrower under this Agreement, the Notes or any other Transaction Document would, after giving effect to (i) all other liabilities of such Borrower, contingent or otherwise, that are relevant under such Fraudulent Transfer Laws (specifically excluding, however, any liabilities of such Borrower in respect of intercompany Consolidated Debt to another Borrower); and (ii) the value as assets of such Borrower (as determined under the applicable provisions of such Fraudulent Transfer Laws) and of any rights of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar rights held by such Borrower, be held or determined to be void, invalid or unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account of the amount of its liability under this Agreement, the Notes or any other Transaction Document, then the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by such Borrower, any Lender, the Agent or any other Person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and enforceable and not subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined in such action or proceeding.
(e)           Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, the Agent is hereby authorized, without notice or demand and without affecting the liability of any Borrower hereunder, to, at any time and from time to time, (i) renew, extend or otherwise increase the time for payment of the Indebtedness; (ii) with the written agreement of Borrowers, accelerate or otherwise change the terms relating to the Indebtedness or otherwise modify, amend or change the terms of any promissory note or other agreement, document or instrument now or hereafter executed by any Borrower and delivered to Agent; (iii) accept partial payments of the Indebtedness; (iv) take and hold security or collateral for the payment of the Indebtedness or for the payment of any guaranties of the Indebtedness and exchange, enforce, waive and release any such security or collateral; (v) apply such security or collateral and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as Agent, in its sole discretion, may determine; (vi) settle, release, compromise, collect or otherwise liquidate the Indebtedness and any security or collateral therefor in any manner; and (vii) exercise, in its sole discretion, any right, remedy or combination thereof that may then be available to Agent, without affecting or impairing the Indebtedness of any Borrower. Except as specifically provided in this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, Agent shall have the exclusive right to determine the time and manner of application of any payments or credits, whether received from any Borrower or any other source, and such determination shall be binding on all Borrowers.  All such payments and credits may be applied, reversed and reapplied, in whole or in part, to any of the Indebtedness as Agent shall determine in its sole discretion without affecting the validity or enforceability of the Indebtedness of any other Borrower.
 
 
75
 
 
(f)           Each Borrower hereby agrees that, except as hereinafter provided, its liability with respect to the Indebtedness hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of (i) the absence of any attempt to collect the Indebtedness from any obligor or other action to enforce the same; (ii) the waiver or consent by Agent with respect to any provision of any instrument evidencing the Indebtedness, or any part thereof, or any other agreement heretofore, now or hereafter executed by a Borrower (other than a Borrower with respect to which such waiver or consent is granted) and delivered to Agent; (iii) the failure by Agent to take any steps to perfect and maintain its security interest in, or to preserve its rights to, any security or collateral for the Indebtedness; (iv) the institution of any proceeding under the United States Bankruptcy Code, or any similar proceeding, by or against a Borrower or Agent's election in any such proceeding of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the United States Bankruptcy Code; (v) any borrowing or grant of a security interest by a Borrower as debtor-in-possession, under Section 364 of the United States Bankruptcy Code; (vi) the disallowance, under Section 502 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, of all or any portion of Agent's claim(s) for repayment of any of the Indebtedness; or (vii) any other circumstance other than payment in full of the Indebtedness which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor or surety.
(g)           Each Borrower hereby waives (i) any right of redemption with respect to the Collateral after the sale hereunder, and all rights, if any, of marshalling of the Collateral or other collateral or security for the Indebtedness; and (ii) any right (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require the Agent or any Lender to (A) proceed against any other Borrower or any other Person, (B) proceed against or exhaust any other collateral or security for any of the Indebtedness, or (C) pursue any remedy in the Agent's or any Lender's power whatsoever.  Each Borrower hereby waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any other Borrower or any other Person other than payment in full of the Indebtedness, including, without limitation, any defense based on or arising out of the disability of any other Borrower or any other Person, or the unenforceability of the Indebtedness or any part thereof for any reason, or the cessation for any reason of the liability of any other Borrower other than payment in full of the Indebtedness.  The Agent may, at its election, foreclose on any security held by the Agent by one or more judicial or non-judicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by applicable law), or exercise any other right or remedy the Agent may have against any other Borrower or any other Person, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Borrower hereunder except to the extent the Indebtedness has been paid in full.  Each Borrower waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the Agent, even though that election of remedies, such as non-judicial foreclosure with respect to security for a guaranteed obligation, has destroyed such Borrower's rights of subrogation and reimbursement against any other Borrower.
 
76
 
 
(h)           Until all Indebtedness has been paid and satisfied in full and all Revolving Credit Commitments and Term Loan Commitments hereunder are terminated, no payment made by or for the account of a Borrower including, without limitation, (i) a payment made by such Borrower on behalf of the liabilities of any other Borrower; or (ii) a payment by any other person under any guaranty, shall entitle such Borrower, by subrogation or otherwise, to any payment from any other Borrower or from or out of any other Borrower's property and such Borrower shall not exercise any right or remedy against any other Borrower or any property of any other Borrower by reason of any performance of such Borrower of its joint and several liability hereunder.
(i)           Any notice given by one Borrower hereunder shall constitute and be deemed to be notice given by all Borrowers, jointly and severally.  Notice given by Agent or Lenders to AMC hereunder or pursuant to any other Transaction Documents in accordance with the terms hereof shall constitute notice to each and every Borrower.  The knowledge of one Borrower shall be imputed to all Borrowers and any consent by one Borrower shall constitute the consent of and shall bind all Borrowers.
(j)           This Section 13.24 is intended to define the relative rights of Borrowers and nothing set forth in this section is intended to or shall impair the Indebtedness of Borrowers, jointly and severally, to pay any amounts as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents.  Nothing contained in this section shall limit the liability of any Borrower to pay the credit facilities made directly or indirectly to that Borrower and accrued interest, fees and expenses with respect thereto or for which such Borrower shall be primarily liable.
(k)           The parties hereto acknowledge that any rights of contribution and indemnification of a Borrower against another Borrower shall constitute assets of each Borrower to which such contribution and indemnification is owing.  The rights of any indemnifying Borrower against the other Borrowers shall be exercisable upon the full and indefeasible payment of the Indebtedness and the termination of the credit facilities hereunder.
(l)           This Agreement is a primary and original obligation of each of the Borrowers and each of the Borrowers shall be liable for all existing and future Indebtedness of any other Borrower as fully as if such Indebtedness were directly incurred by such Borrower.
 
77
 
 
(m)           Each Borrower further agrees that its Indebtedness hereunder shall not be impaired in any manner whatsoever by any bankruptcy, extensions, moratoria or other relief granted to any other Borrower pursuant to any statute presently in force or hereafter enacted.
Upon the First Closing Date, the Original Loan Agreement shall be simultaneously amended and restated pursuant to the terms hereof.
Each Borrower (a) ratifies and reaffirms the liens and security interests granted to the Lenders and to the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders in connection with the Original Loan Agreement and the amendments and joinders thereto and (b) agrees that the Security Interest granted under this Agreement is a continuation of such existing liens and security interests and shall relate back to the date such existing liens and security interests were first granted.
 
78
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first above written.

Exhibit 99.1
 
The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company
 
DENVER, CO, July 5, 2011  Air Methods Corporation (Nasdaq: AIRM), the largest air medical  transportation company in the world, announced today that it has successfully closed, together with its bank group, led by KeyBank National Association (NYSE: KEY), a five-year Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Facility).  The Amended Credit Facility is comprised of a $100 million revolving line of credit and subject to the completion of Air Methods acquisition of Omniflight Helicopters, Inc. (Omniflight) and other standard closing conditions, a $200 million term loan.  The Amended Credit Facility replaces Air Methods current revolving line of credit of $50 million and its $50 million term loan, which were scheduled to mature in September 2012.
 
The Amended Credit Facility allows Air Methods to increase the revolving line of credit and/or the term loan by up to an additional $50 million in the future, subject to lender participation.  The Credit Facility is secured by assets of Air Methods and certain of its subsidiaries.
 
A copy of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement will be filed in the coming days with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Air Methods also announced that on June 28, 2011, it voluntarily withdrew its premerger notification and report under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (HSR Act) filed on June 6, 2011 in connection with its contemplated acquisition of Omniflight.  Air Methods re-filed its premerger notification and report with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on June 30, 2011 in order to begin a new waiting period under the HSR Act and provide the FTC with additional time to conclude its review of the proposed acquisition.  The FTC's review is a routine part of the approval process of major proposed transactions.
 
Air Methods remains committed to working cooperatively with the FTC as they complete their review of the proposed acquisition.  Based on the date that Air Methods re-filed its premerger notification and report, Air Methods anticipates that the new waiting period under the HSR Act will expire at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, on July 30, 2011 unless this period is terminated earlier.

Air Methods Reports 2Q2011 Results and 3Q2011 Update
DENVER, CO., August 4, 2011 -- Air Methods Corporation (Nasdaq: AIRM), the largest air medical transportation company in the world, reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2011 and provided an update on July 2011 community-based patient transports.  For the quarter, revenue increased 8% from $139.2 million to $150.2 million in the current-year quarter.  For the six-month period, revenue increased 9% to $282.1 million, compared with $257.7 million in the prior-year six-month period.
 
For the quarter, net income decreased 21% to $10.1 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, as compared with prior-year second quarter net income of $12.8 million, or $1.02 per diluted share.  Net income for the six-month period increased 25% to $16.1 million, or $1.26 per diluted share, compared to $12.9 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, for the prior-year six-month period.  As previously disclosed, the current-year second quarter results include a pre-tax, non-cash loss of approximately $0.8 million, compared with a loss of $0.1 million in the prior-year quarter, associated with the mark to market of a fuel derivative.  In addition, the current-year quarter includes $0.3 million in transaction costs associated with the recently completed acquisition of OF Air Holdings and its subsidiaries (together, Omniflight).  The current-year quarter also includes a pre-tax loss on disposition of assets of $0.3 million, compared with a pre-tax gain of $0.1 million in the prior-year quarter.  The remaining decrease in quarterly earnings, as compared with the prior-year period, was attributed to lower than anticipated community-based patient transports attributed to higher weather cancellations, and to higher maintenance expenditures.
 
For the second quarter, community-based revenue increased 9% to $94.1 million compared to $86.6 million in the prior year, while segment net income decreased 4% to $19.7 million from $20.4 million.  Total community-based patient transports decreased by 2% to 10,309, as compared with 10,507 in the prior-year quarter.  Community-based patient transports for bases open greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) decreased 6%, or 659 patient transports, as compared with the prior-year quarter.  Weather cancellations for these same base locations increased by 343 compared with the prior-year quarter.  Net revenue per community-based transport was $9,008 for the current-year quarter, compared with $8,181 in the prior-year quarter, a 10% increase.  Hospital-based revenue decreased by 1% to $48.6 million compared to $49.1 million in the prior-year period, while segment net income decreased 61% to $2.0 million from $5.1 million.  External revenue within the Products Division increased $4.0 million, or 112%, compared with the prior-year quarter, while external segment net income increased by 154% to $1.2 million in the current-year quarter. Consolidated maintenance expense increased by $5.5 million or 30%, as compared with the prior-year quarter, despite a 1% decrease in flight volume.  This increase was partially attributed to a $1.2 million increase in aircraft blade replacement costs and lower than average maintenance expenditures experienced in the prior-year quarter.
 
The Company also provided a preliminary update on July 2011 flight volume.  Total community-based transports were 3,856 during July 2011 compared with 3,646 in July 2010, a 6% increase.  Same-Base Transports during the month of July decreased by 14 transports as compared with July 2010, while weather cancellations decreased by 209 as compared with the prior-year month for these same bases.
 
 
 
Aaron Todd, CEO, stated, We are pleased to have experienced a return to more moderate weather during the month of July.  We are also encouraged that we have been able to achieve healthy growth in net revenue per community-based transport, despite some minor deterioration in payer mix over the past year.  We look forward to the anticipated benefit associated with our recently completed acquisition of Omniflight over future periods.  We have engaged our plan of integration and expect to fully execute this plan over the next six months.  Our financial projections associated with the acquisition continue to be in-line with previously-disclosed expectations.
 
The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern.  Interested parties can access the call by dialing (877) 883-0656 (domestic) or (706) 643-8826 (international) or by accessing the web cast at .

Exhibit 99.2
The #1 Airborne Healthcare Company
 
 
DENVER, CO, August 1, 2011  Air Methods Corporation (Nasdaq: AIRM), the largest air medical transportation company in the world, announced today that it has successfully completed its acquisition of OF Air Holdings Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Omniflight Helicopters, Inc. (together, Omniflight). Omniflight provides air medical transport services throughout the United States and provides these services under both the community-based and hospital-based service delivery models, utilizing a fleet of approximately 100 helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. Omniflight is headquartered in Addison, Texas, with operations in 18 states involving over 75 base locations.
 
In connection with the closing of the acquisition of Omniflight, Air Methods successfully closed on a $200 million term loan with its bank group, led by KeyBank National Association (NYSE: KEY). The $200 million term loan, plus additional cash on hand, was used to finance the acquisition of Omniflight.
 
Aaron Todd, CEO of Air Methods stated, We are very pleased to have completed all the necessary steps to close our acquisition of Omniflight within two weeks of our original expectation.  Closing this transaction during the peak summer months should provide greater financial offset to non-recurring transaction and transition costs which will be expensed during the initial months following closing.  The interest rate on our term loan is approximately 2.5%, which fluctuates with the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR).  Our original pro-forma consolidated financial statements assumed an average rate of 5% cost of funds, thus providing added cushion from our initial projections.  We continue to believe that the operational efficiencies associated with this combination will help ensure that Air Methods remains cost competitive, while still maintaining its very high safety and quality standards.

See the disclosure contained in Item 5.02 below regarding the Plan (as defined below) and the 2011 EVA (as defined below), which is incorporated herein by reference.

Performance Pay Plan
On September 30, 2011, the Board of Directors (the Board) of Air Methods Corporation (the Company), at the recommendation of the Companys Compensation Committee, approved the Air Methods Corporation Performance Pay Plan (the Plan).
The Plan is subject to shareholder approval.  The Company plans to seek shareholder approval of the Plan at its 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  Upon the adoption and approval of the Plan by the Company's shareholders, the Company intends that annual cash incentive payments to certain executives under the Plan and any programs established thereunder will qualify as performance-based compensation and be fully deductible by the Company for federal income tax purposes under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code").  In the event that shareholder approval is not obtained at the 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, no bonus award will be payable pursuant to the Plan or any programs established thereunder.
The purposes of the Plan are to (i) place a significant portion of the compensation of the Plan participants at risk by tying such compensation to specific measurable goals designed to drive shareholder value, and (ii) exempt bonuses paid thereunder from the deduction limitations of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.  The Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee.
Key terms of the Plan include, among other things:

2011-2014 Bonus Program
Concurrently with the adoption of the Plan and subject to the terms thereof, the Board adopted and established the 2011-2014 Bonus Program under the Plan (the 2011 EVA).

The 2011 EVA participants are Michael D. Allen, Trent J. Carman, Howard L. Ragsdale, Edward T. Rupert, Paul H. Tate and Aaron D. Todd.  All capitalized terms that are not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms under the 2011 EVA.
The amounts that the participants may receive under the 2011 EVA will be based upon the Economic Value Added (as defined below) during the period of time commencing July 1, 2011 and ending on June 30, 2014 (the Performance Period).  Under the 2011 EVA, the Economic Value Added shall be the sum of: (a) the Closing Valuation (b) the Opening Valuation.  The foregoing valuations shall be determined as follows:
minus
The Compensation Committee will determine the Economic Value Added after the expiration of the Performance Period, but in no event later than September 1, 2014.  In the event the Economic Value Added is a positive number, each Participant shall be entitled to receive a certain percentage (as set forth in Section 3 of the 2011 EVA) of the increase in the Economic Value Added (the Distributable EVA).  The Distributable EVA due under the 2011 EVA shall be payable in three equal installments on each of September 12, 2014, January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2016 (each a Payment Date, and collectively, the Payment Dates).  However, to receive any such bonus payment, the Participant must be employed by the Company and hold the same, or an equivalent or more senior position (as set forth in Section 2 of the 2011 EVA) on each of the scheduled Payment Dates.

In accordance with the terms of the 2011 EVA, the Compensation Committee may, in its reasonable discretion, make adjustments to the Economic Value Added to properly measure the Companys performance during the Performance Period.
Copies of the Plan and the 2011 EVA are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing descriptions of the Plan and the 2011 EVA are qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Plan and the 2011 EVA.

Exhibit 10.2
 
The following terms and conditions set forth the 2011  2014 Bonus Program established under the Air Methods Corporation Performance Pay Plan (the ).  In the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of this program and the terms and conditions of the Performance Pay Plan, the terms and conditions of the Performance Pay Plan shall control.
Performance Pay Plan
The 2011  2014 Bonus Program is designed to measure financial performance of the Company in terms of Economic Value Added or EVA (as defined below) and to provide incentive compensation solely in the event EVA is positive during the Performance Period (positive EVA being the Performance Goal for the Performance Period).  A portion of any positive EVA during the Performance Period will then be available for distribution to program Participants (the ).  Each Participants bonus compensation will generally be equal to a percentage of the Distributable EVA, as established for the Participant in Section 3 below.  However, it is anticipated that the bonus compensation otherwise payable to a Participant will be reduced by the Committee pursuant to Section 4 if such reduction is in the best interests of the stockholders of the Company.
Distributable EVA
The Performance Period for this bonus program shall begin July 1, 2011 and shall end on June 30, 2014.
The following chart sets forth the Participants in the 2011  2014 Bonus Program and the percentage of Distributable EVA established for each Participant:
 
 
 
 
As soon as administratively practicable after the end of the Performance Period (but in no event later than September 1, 2014), the Committee shall certify in writing (which certification may be in the form of minutes of the Committee) the Bonus Amount (if any) to which each Participant is entitled as a result of the EVA for the Performance Period, which Bonus Amount shall be determined in accordance with this Section.  The Committees written certification shall detail in writing the results of each step in the bonus determination process described below.
  The Committee shall certify in writing (which certification may be in the form of minutes of the Committee) the EVA for the Performance Period.  In making its determination, the Committee shall rely on the auditedfinancial statements of the Company; provided, however, if the Companys audited financial statements are not available, the Company shall rely on the unaudited financial statements of the Company.  The Committee shall make adjustments in determining EVA to properly measure the Companys performance during the Performance Period in accordance with Section 5.1 of the Performance Pay Plan.  Any adjustments made by the Committee shall be described in the certification of the EVA calculation, as required by this Section, and the description shall include the reasoning for such adjustment.   In the event EVA for the Performance Period is not a positive number, no Bonus Amounts shall be payable pursuant to this program and no further determinations need be made by the Committee.
Step 1  Calculate EVA for the Performance Period.
 
 
After the Committee certifies the EVA for the Performance Period, the Committee shall determine the Distributable EVA for the Performance Period, which shall be equal to:
Step 2  Calculate Distributable EVA for the Performance Period.  
  After the Committee determines the Distributable EVA for the Performance Period, the Committee shall calculate the initial bonus amount for each Participant, which shall be equal to:
Step 3  Calculate Initial Bonus Amounts for Each Participant.
 
  After the Committee determines the initial bonus amount for each Participant, it shall then determine the actual Bonus Amount payable to each Participant.  The actual Bonus Amount for a Participant shall equal the initial bonus amount for such Participant any reduction in the initial bonus amount for such Participant determined by the Committee to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.  It is anticipated, but not required, that the Committee will reduce the initial bonus amount to which any Participant is otherwise entitled if senior management fails to adequately (i) develop non-core products, and/or (ii) build infrastructure for human resources and information technology departments.  It is anticipated further that other reductions to the initial bonus amount of any Participant shall be instituted by the Committee solely in the event of extraordinary circumstances.  The Committee is not required to reduce any initial bonus amounts pursuant to this Section, and all reductions shall be determined individually on a Participant-by-Participant basis.  In no event may the reduction of any Participants initial bonus amount result in an increase to the actual Bonus Amount for any other Participant.
Step 4  Determine Final Bonus Amounts for each Participant.

(ii)  if the resignation or termination for Cause occurs after the end of the regularly scheduled Performance Period but prior to a Payment Date, the Participant shall forfeit any unpaid portion of the Bonus Amount as of the date of termination.  For example, if the Participant voluntarily resigns from the Company or is terminated for Cause on June 30, 2015, the Participant would not be entitled to receive any unpaid portion of the Bonus Amount which would have otherwise been payable on January 1, 2016.
 
 
 
 
 
(b)           .  In the event the Participant is terminated without Cause or is demoted prior to January 1, 2016 and prior to any of the other events set forth in subsections (a), (c) or (d) of this Section 5.3, then:
Termination Without Cause; Demotion
(i)  if the termination without Cause or demotion occurs prior to the end of the regularly scheduled Performance Period, the Participant shall forfeit any right to receive any Bonus Amount hereunder.
(ii)  if the Participant is terminated without Cause or is demoted after the end of the regularly scheduled Performance Period, any portion of the Bonus Amount that has not yet been paid as of the date of termination shall become payable immediately.
(c)             In the event the Participant dies or becomes Disabled prior to January 1, 2016 and prior to any of the other events set forth in subsections (a), (b) or (d) of this Section 5.3, then:
Death; Disability.
(i)  if the death or Disability occurs prior to the end of the regularly scheduled Performance Period, the Company shall treat the Performance Period as having ended (with respect to the affected Participant only) on the date of death or Disability and shall determine EVA, Distributable EVA, and the affected Participants Bonus Amount as of such date.  The Participants Bonus Amount as so calculated shall become payable immediately.
(ii)  if the death or Disability occurs after the end of the regularly scheduled Performance Period, any portion of the Bonus Amount that has not yet been paid as of the date of death or Disability shall become payable immediately.

Change in Control.
 
(i)  if the Change in Control occurs prior to the end of the regularly scheduled Performance Period, the Company or any successor in such Change in Control transaction shall, in its sole and absolute discretion, either (A) treat the Performance Period as having ended on the date of the Change in Control, in which case the Company shall determine EVA, Distributable EVA, and individual Bonus Amounts for all Participants as of such date, and Bonus Amounts as so calculated shall be paid in full on the date of the Change in Control, or (B) elect to continue the terms hereof in which case the Performance Period shall continue as if such Change in Control had not occurred and payment (if any) shall be made in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Section 5.
 
 
 
 
(ii)  if the Change in Control occurs after the end of the regularly scheduled Performance Period, any Bonus Amounts that have not yet been paid shall become payable immediately.
           .  Each Bonus Amount that becomes payable under this program shall be paid solely from the general assets of the Company.  Nothing herein shall be construed to create a trust or to establish or evidence any Participants claim of any right other than as an unsecured general creditor with respect to any payment to which he may be entitled.
5.3

Pro Forma Financial Information
The following are attached to this Form 8-K/A as Exhibit 99.3 and incorporated herein by reference: (a) the unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2011, as adjusted for the acquisition of Omniflight, as if the acquisition had occurred on June 30, 2011; and (b) the unaudited pro forma combined statements of income for the six months ended June 30, 2011, and the year ended December 31, 2010, which combines the historical operations of the Company with the historical operations of Omniflight as if the transaction had occurred on January 1, 2010 (collectively, the Pro Forma Statements).
Note that in Omniflights historical financial statements used in the Pro Forma Statements attached hereto, certain aircraft leases were classified as capital leases based upon certain default clauses deemed to be subjective and Omniflights interpretation of the maximum amount they could be required to pay to the lessor in the event of default. In the Companys historical financial statements used in the Pro Forma Statements attached hereto, aircraft leases with similar provisions are classified as operating leases based upon the Companys differing interpretation of the maximum amount they could be required to pay to the lessor in the event of default.
In light of the foregoing, the Company has submitted a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission requesting clarification regarding the appropriate GAAP interpretation of ASC 840-10-25-14, which may impact the Companys presentation for aircraft leases.

EXHIBIT INDEX
                            
Exhibit No.
Description
 
 

Exhibit 99.3
 
On August 1, 2011, Air Methods Corporation (the Company) acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of OF Air Holdings Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Omniflight Helicopters, Inc. (together, Omniflight), for a cash purchase price of $200 million, subject to final determination of working capital, as defined in the merger agreement, as of the closing date. The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet presents the historical financial information of the Company as of June 30, 2011, as adjusted for the acquisition of Omniflight, as if the acquisition had occurred on June 30, 2011.
The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined statements of income for the six months ended June 30, 2011, and the year ended December 31, 2010, combine the historical operations of the Company with the historical operations of Omniflight as if the transaction had occurred on January 1, 2010. Because Omniflights fiscal year-end was previously March 31, Omniflights historical statement of income for the year ended March 31, 2011, was combined with the Companys statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2010, for purposes of the pro forma presentation for the year ended December 31, 2010. The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined statement of income for the six months ended June 30, 2011, combine the historical operations of the Company for the six months ended June 30, 2011 with the six months for Omniflight, including the three months ended March 31, 2011. These same three months are also included in the pro forma statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2010.
The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting whereby the total estimated purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition based on their estimated fair values as of the effective date of the acquisition. The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements have been prepared by the Companys management based upon the historical financial statements of the Company and Omniflight and preliminary estimates of fair values, which are subject to change pending a final analysis of the fair values and useful lives, as applicable. These pro forma statements may not be indicative of the results that actually would have occurred if the combination had been in effect on the dates indicated or which may be obtained in the future. The pro forma financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements included in the Companys previous filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In Omniflights historical financial statements used in the accompanying pro forma financial statements, certain aircraft leases were classified as capital leases based upon certain default clauses deemed to be subjective and Omniflights interpretation of the maximum amount they could be required to pay to the lessor in the event of default. In the Companys historical financial statements used in the accompanying pro forma financial statements, aircraft leases with similar provisions are classified as operating leases based upon the Companys differing interpretation of the maximum amount they could be required to pay to the lessor in the event of default.
In light of the foregoing, the Company has submitted a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission requesting clarification regarding the appropriate GAAP interpretation of ASC 840-10-25-14, which may impact the Companys presentation for aircraft leases. The effects of any change in the Companys presentation of aircraft leases are not included in the accompanying unaudited pro forma combined financial statements.

Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are presented to reflect the acquisition of Omniflight by the Company using the acquisition method of accounting whereby the total estimated purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition based on their estimated fair values as of the effective date of the acquisition.
The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet presents the historical financial information of the Company, as of June 30, 2011, as adjusted for the acquisition of Omniflight, as if the transaction had occurred on June 30, 2011. The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined statements of income for the six months ended June 30, 2011, and the year ended December 31, 2010, combine the historical operations of the Company with the historical operations of Omniflight as if the transaction had occurred on January 1, 2010. Certain reclassifications have been made to the historical Omniflight financial statement presentation to conform to the Companys basis of presentation.
These pro forma statements may not be indicative of the results that actually would have occurred if the combination had been in effect on the dates indicated or which may be obtained in the future. The Company recorded approximately $250,000 in transaction costs related to the acquisition of Omniflight in its historical statement of income for the six months ended June 30, 2011, included in this pro forma presentation. In the year ending December 31, 2011, the Company expects to incur the following nonrecurring expenses relating to the acquisition and integration of Omniflight into the Companys operations: approximately $1.1 million in additional transaction costs, $1.4 million in stay bonuses and severance for Omniflight employees, and $2.8 million related to the consolidation of Omniflights Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate into the Companys certificate. These nonrecurring charges are not included in pro forma income statements included in this document.

Fiscal Periods Presented
Prior to the acquisition, Omniflights fiscal year-end was March 31. In the accompanying unaudited pro forma combined statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2010, Omniflights historical statement of income for the year ended March 31, 2011, was combined with the Companys statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2010. The unaudited pro forma combined statement of income for the six months ended June 30, 2011, includes the three months ended March 31, 2011, for Omniflight. These same three months are also included in the pro forma statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2010. Summarized operating information about the duplicated quarter is as follows:

On November 9, 2011, Air Methods Corporation (the Company) announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2011. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report. The information contained in this report, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (Exchange Act), nor shall information be deemed incorporated by reference in any registration statement, proxy statement, or other report filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
As previously disclosed, the Company is awaiting a response from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the appropriate GAAP interpretation of ASC 840-10-25-14, which may impact the Companys presentation for aircraft leases. Consequently, the consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarter ended September 30, 2011, to be filed with the Companys Form 10-Q have not been reviewed by an independent public accountant in accordance with Statement of Auditing Standards No. 100, Interim Financial Information (SAS 100). Because such review by the Companys independent registered public accounting
firm has not been performed, the Companys Form 10-Q filed on November 9, 2011, will be deemed deficient.
In light of the foregoing issues, the Company suspended the use of the Form S-8 Registration Statement that registers shares of the Companys common stock that are acquired pursuant to the Companys 401(k) Plan.  As a result, the Company notified its directors and executive officers that the 401(k) Plan will be subject to a blackout period during which all 401(k) Plan participants will be unable to direct investments into the Companys stock fund under the 401(k) Plan.  The blackout period is necessary because the Registration Statement on Form S-8 that registers shares of the Companys common stock that are acquired in connection with the 401(k) Plan will not be available for use until the Company has timely filed all periodic reports with the SEC.
 
The blackout period is currently expected to be lifted when the Company has filed the necessary amendments to any of its deficient filings, including amendments to Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011, and Form 8-K/A filed on October 17, 2011. The Company expects to take such actions once it has received guidance from the SEC on the lease accounting issue described above. The Company is unable to predict at this time when it will be able to do so, but based on conversations with the SEC to date, the Company expects to hear from the SEC on or before December 1, 2011, but there are no guarantees that the SEC will issue any guidance on the issue by such date, or at any time.
As a result, pursuant to Regulation BTR, on November 9, 2011, the Company sent notices to its directors and executive officers notifying them that the Companys blackout period then in effect would be extended and, until notice is provided that such blackout period is terminated, they are prohibited from purchasing, selling, or otherwise acquiring or transferring, directly or indirectly, any of the Companys common shares or any other equity security of the Company and related derivative securities to the extent that common shares or any other equity security was acquired in connection with employment as an executive officer or services as a director.
This notice regarding the blackout period was provided to executive officers and directors to ensure compliance with Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Rule 104 of Regulation BTR. A copy of the notice sent to the directors and executive officers regarding the blackout period is attached as Exhibit 99.2 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
Advance notice of the blackout period to our directors and executive officers was not possible due to events that were unforeseeable and circumstances that were beyond the reasonable control of the Company.
Inquiries regarding the blackout period should be directed to Crystal L. Gordon, Vice President and Associate General Counsel, Air Methods Corporation, 7301 South Peoria Street, Englewood, Colorado, 80112; Telephone: (303)792-7400.

Air Methods Reports 3Q2011 Results and 4Q2011 Update
Fully-Diluted Earnings Per-Share of $1.44 Includes $0.11 Per-Share Impact of Transaction,
Severance and Other Transition Costs Associated with Recent Acquisition
DENVER, CO., November 9, 2011 -- Air Methods Corporation (Nasdaq: AIRM) reported results for the quarter ended September 30, 2011. Revenue increased 20% to $185.2 million from $153.9 million in the year-ago quarter.  For the nine-month period, revenue increased 14% to $467.2 million, up from $411.6 million in the prior-year nine-month period.  For the quarter, net income decreased slightly to $18.5 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, as compared with 2010 third quarter net income of $18.6 million, or $1.48 per diluted share. Net income for the nine-month period increased 10% to $34.5 million, or $2.70 per diluted share, compared to $31.5 million, or $2.51 per diluted share, for the prior-year period.
 
On August 1, 2011, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of OF Air Holdings Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Omniflight Helicopters, Inc. (together, Omniflight). The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 include the consolidated operations of Omniflight since the date of the acquisition.  Net revenue from Omniflights operations for the two months ended September 30, 2011 was $26.7 million.  Pre-tax earnings were reduced by approximately $1.5 million and $1.8 million for the 2011 three- and nine-month periods, respectively, for transaction costs and employee severance expenses related to the acquisition of Omniflight.  Pre-tax earnings for both periods were further reduced by approximately $0.9 million in total related to incremental, non-recurring costs of transitioning Omniflights general and administrative functions into existing Air Methods departments. Amortization expense of intangible assets acquired in the acquisition equaled $0.7 million for the two months ended September 30, 2011.
 
As previously disclosed, the Company is awaiting a response from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding an interpretation under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles that may impact the Companys presentation for aircraft leases, as further described in the Companys 10-Q for the third quarter 2011 filed with the SEC today. With guidance from the SEC, the Company will be able to complete a final version of its financial statements contained in the 10-Q and the Companys independent public accounting firm will be able complete its review of such financial statements. On todays conference call (referenced below), management will provide preliminary estimates of financial impact should potential reclassification be required.
Third Quarter Highlights
Revenue from Community-Based Services increased 28% to $123.4 million from $96.1 million, while segment net income increased 19% to $32.3 million during the third quarter, as compared with segment net income of $27.0 million in the prior-year quarter. Net community-based services revenue generated from Omniflight patient transports during the two months ended September 30, 2011 was $21.3 million.  Net revenue per community-based transport increased 6% to $9,229 compared with $8,720 in the prior-year quarter. Increase in net revenue per community-based transport was partially offset by a lower percentage (3%) of Omniflight patients with private insurance, as compared with Air Methods insured
patient percentages. Total community-based patient transports increased 21% to 13,173 in the current-year quarter from 10,876 in the prior-year quarter. Community-based patient transports for bases open greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) and excluding Omniflight transports decreased 9%, or 908 transports, as compared with the prior-year quarter.  The great majority of this decrease was realized during the month of September. Weather cancellations for these same-base locations decreased by 55 transports compared with the prior-year quarter.
 
 
 
 
Revenue from Hospital-Based Services increased by 5% to $53.1 million from $50.6 million, while segment net income increased by 14% to $5.1 million in the current-year quarter from $4.5 million during the prior-year third quarter.  Hospital-based services revenue generated from Omniflight hospital contracts during the two months ended September 30, 2011 was $5.4 million. This revenue increase was partially offset by conversion of hospital-based services to community-based services which decreased divisional revenue by $2.8 million.
Consolidated maintenance expense for the current-year quarter decreased by 17%, or $4.1 million, despite an increase in flight volume of 27%.  This decrease was partially attributed to a $1.6 million credit related to a negotiated revision in an agreement covering main rotor blade replacement costs for a particular aircraft model.  The six-month period ended June 30, 2011 included $1.3 million of maintenance expense related to this same agreement.  Fuel costs increased $2.8 million during the current-year quarter as compared to the prior-year quarter, representing a 47% increase per hour flown.
Revenue from our Products Division, excluding revenue generated from internal projects, increased to $8.7 million from $7.3 million in the prior-year quarter, a 20% increase. Segment net income, excluding internal projects, decreased slightly to $1.9 million from $2.3 million in the prior-year quarter.
 
The Company also provided an update on preliminary October 2011 flight volume. Total community-based transports during October 2011 were 4,815 compared with 3,855 during October 2010, reflecting a 25% increase.  The increase is entirely attributed to the acquisition of Omniflight. Total October 2011 volume compares with 5,074 and 4,314 community-based patient transports in August and September 2011, respectively, the first two months of combined operations with Omniflight. Same-Base Transports (excluding Omniflight transports) for October decreased 581 transports, or 15%, while weather cancellations for these same bases increased by 165 transports.
 
Aaron Todd, Chief Executive Officer, stated, We are on-target with our original expectations for financial performance since our acquisition of Omniflight. Although severe weather in September dramatically affected our overall flight volume, strong reimbursement and reduced maintenance expenditures provided positive offsets.  We are encouraged by the rebound in flight volume during the month of October as compared with September, since September is typically a stronger flight volume month. The decrease in October Same-Base Transports is primarily attributed to the strength of the prior-year month. October 2010 community-based patient transports were 16% higher than the monthly average for the entire year and 26% higher than October 2009.
 
The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern.

Exhibit 99.2
INTERNAL MEMO
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Regulation BTR promulgated thereunder, this notice is to inform you, as directors and executive officers of Air Methods Corporation (the Company), that the Companys 401(k) Plan (the 401(k) Plan) will be subject to a blackout period during which all 401(k) Plan participants will be unable to purchase shares in the 401(k) Plan. The blackout only prevents participants from making additional investments in the Companys common stock through the 401(k) Plan; participants will still be able to reallocate assets in their accounts from the Companys common stock fund into the other investment options offered under the 401(k) Plan.
 
The blackout period is currently expected to be lifted when the Company has filed the necessary amendments to any of its deficient filings, including amendments to Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 and Form 8-K/A filed on October 17, 2011.  The Company expects to take such actions once it has received guidance from the SEC on the lease accounting issue described below.  In reliance on the unforeseeable circumstances exemption under Section 306(a), the unknown and evolving facts pertaining to the lease accounting issue and the Companys ability to file a complete 10-Q put the Company in a position where it was unable to give advance notice of the blackout period to you.
 
The blackout period is a result of the Companys failure to timely file its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011.  As you are aware, the Company is awaiting a response from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the appropriate GAAP interpretation of ASC 840-10-25-14, which may impact the Companys presentation for aircraft leases.  Consequently, the consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 to be filed with the Companys Form 10-Q have not been reviewed by an independent public accountant in accordance with Statement of Auditing Standards No. 100, Interim Financial Information (SAS 100).  Because such review by the Companys independent registered public accounting firm has not been performed, the Companys Form 10-Q filed on November 9, 2011 will be deemed deficient.
 
Pursuant to Section 306(a), during the blackout period, all executive officers and directors of the Company will be prohibited from trading in all Company equity securities (Service Securities) acquired by them in connection with their service and/or employment with the Company in such capacities. As a result, during the blackout period, you will not be able to directly or indirectly, acquire, dispose of or transfer any Service Securities, subject to certain limited exceptions.  
Until you have received further notice from the Company, please contact me to determine whether an exception applies to a transaction by you in Service Securities.
 
Once the Company terminates this blackout period, you will be permitted to resume transactions in the Companys common stock and other equity securities, subject to the requirements of our Insider Trading Policy and applicable law.

At the conclusion of today's prepared remarks, we will open the call for a question and answer session.  I would like to remind everyone, this conference call includes statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meetings of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  This conference call includes certain forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties.
 
With that having been said, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Aaron Todd, Chief Executive Officer of Air Methods Corporation.
 
 
As Trent will be offering more details in a moment concerning our third quarter financial results in his remarks, I wanted to spend most of my time offering an update on the Omniflight transition and other recent events.
 
Let me just say the Omniflight transition is going extremely well and our financial outlook for increased net cash flows and earnings is on track.  One issue which arose during the transition had to do with differences in methodologies used by both companies to account for aircraft leases.  While the key terms and structures of our aircraft leases are very similar, just prior to closing Omniflight's auditors requested that Omniflight reclassify the majority of their aircraft leases from operating leases to capital lease accounting.  The result of this was to increase capital lease obligations by approximately $37 million but also increase earnings before income taxes, interest and depreciation and amortization expenses, or EBITDA, by approximately $7 million for the year ended March 31, 2011.

As a result of this change, purchased EBITDA based on the year ended March 31, 2011 Omniflight results was $34 million and total consideration paid was approximately $237 million.  This represents a purchase price of approximately 7 times EBITDA, one multiple lower than previously estimated, which is a good thing.
 
Air Methods has continued to present its aircraft leases as operating leases in the Form 10-Q released today.  If the SEC or the Company choose to have the leases reclassified as capital leases, the preliminary estimated financial impact would be as follows.  EBITDA for the fiscal year ended 2010 would increase by approximately $50 million.  Capital lease obligations would increase by approximately $280 million or less than six times EBITDA.  Since the Company's stock trades in excess of six times EBITDA, this change would be favorable to our enterprise value based on market multiples of EBITDA.  EPS for fiscal year 2010 is currently estimated to be less than a 4 percent reduction to prior-year earnings.  Similar effects will be estimated for the fiscal year ending 2011.  These estimates are pending adjustments for historical aircraft refinancing and dispositions and appropriate audit and review procedures.
 
Of course, there is no economic impact associated with the reclassifications, only timing of expense and gain or loss recognition.  In other words, anything associated with the reclassification that would reduce historical earnings would result in increased future earnings, and anything that would increase historical earnings would result in reduced future earnings if the reclassification were required.
 
Other updates related to the Omniflight transition include the following.  To date we have eliminated 92 net overhead positions as a result of the acquisition.  This represents nearly a $7 million reduction in annual compensation not including the additional reducing effect on employee benefits and taxes.  As mentioned in our press release, total transaction and severance costs expensed during the third quarter were $1.5 million.  An additional $0.9 million was expensed associated with general and administrative costs to transition or wind out pre-closing activities.  Preliminary purchase accounting allocated a significant portion of the purchase price in excess of fair market value of tangible assets to specifically identifiable assets.  This resulted in approximately $325,000 of monthly amortization expense for future periods associated with allocation of purchase price.

EBITDA increased from $36.2 million in the prior-year third quarter on a consolidated basis to $43.1 million in the current-year quarter.  To see EBITDA increase almost $7 million due to primarily to the benefits of the acquisition for 2 of the 3 months is very encouraging.  Keep in mind, this increase is despite the $2.4 million in nonrecurring transaction and transition costs expensed during the quarter.
 
Turning to other matters, the following key achievements have been realized since our last conference call.  As previously announced, we were successful in securing a long-term contract with Community Health Systems to facilitate and coordinate their air medical transport needs.  They transported over 14,700 patients last year, of which our community-based locations transported approximately 1000 of these patients.  We are presently launching these services in approximately 10 percent of their locations with regional launches to follow in the coming months.  We believe this contract is a watershed event as their medical service providers will hopefully now be selected as much for their quality and safety as well as their proximity to the patient.  We are honored to be partnered with Community Health in this worthy effort.
 
In August 2011 we successfully converted four bases of operation from a hospital-based services model to the community-based model.  We have never converted 6 bases including these 4 since the beginning of the year and have opened 5 additional community-based locations based on new relationships and market opportunities.  We are in discussions with several major hospital-based customers for possible conversions from hospital-based services to modify or full  fully outsourced community-based services.  We were also awarded a new contract with a non-Air Methods Hospital customer to retrofit four EC-145 twin-engine helicopters with EMS interiors.
 
With that before me, I will turn the call over to Trent offer further details on our third-quarter results.  a.

EBITDA for the trailing 12 period ended September 30 was $115 million, and as Aaron mentioned previously, for the quarter it was approximately $43 million.  And as you know, you can reconcile EBITDA by adding interest expense, depreciation, amortization and subtracting gain on disposition to income before income taxes plans.
 
On a 3-month lag basis, the Company's payer mix for the 3 months ended June 30, 2011 was 37 percent insurance, 28 percent Medicare, 20 percent Medicaid and 15 percent uninsured.  This compares to 35 percent insurance, 32 percent Medicare, 22 percent Medicaid and 11 percent for uninsured, for the 3 months ended March 30, 2011.
 
For the 12 months ended June 30, 2011, the payer mix was 36 percent insurance, 30 percent Medicare, 21 percent Medicaid and 13 percent uninsured.  Cash collections from our insured patients continues to remain very strong.  For the 12 months ended March 30,  March 31, 2011, cash collections as a percentage of the gross charge for insured patients was 80 percent.  This collection percentage has been 80 percent or more since the beginning of 2010.  Cash payments as a percent of our gross charge for Medicare and Medicaid were 28 percent and 11 percent, respectively, for this same period.
 
Cash flow generated by the Company during the first three quarters was $23.7 million.  The Company used $29.7 million of cash primarily to fund the purchase of 16 previously leased aircraft.  The Company had a net debt position, which is a total of all indebtedness, including the Omni capital leases less cash, of approximately $291 million at the end of the quarter.  Approximately $240 million of this debt relates to the Omni [acquisition] indebtedness on their capital leases.  The Company currently operates 397 aircraft in the fleet, and the Company currently operates 173 community bases.

Now, I think some of the analysts have, I think, conservatively estimated 1000 of those 3000 could be realized with existing operations.  And, obviously, some of our hospital customers will benefit if they meet these standards and criteria as part of the relationship.  And then, certainly, we will do all that we can to add additional aircraft or relocate aircraft to be the needs of Community Health as one of their qualified and preferred providers.  And so we are phasing it in just to make sure that we don't overwhelm the system and that we make sure that we run the process very smoothly.
 
But I don't think anyone's expectation that this is going to take more than two, three quarters to roll out.  But if we encounter some difficulties, it may take longer than that.
 
 
 
And without going into specifics as to why that was elevated as a priority to them, they were, I think, very much on the forefront of recognizing that as an organization of I think it's 132 hospitals, the majority of which are sending institutions rather than receiving centers, that they have a responsibility to not just use whoever happens to be the closest, but that they are looking at various  all these other critical factors as well.  And so that's really the backdrop for it.

Yes, we have had initial discussions with other larger providers, keeping in mind that some providers may be much larger, hospital service providers, but they may be primarily receiving centers and there's always very and degrees of influence over which air medical service gets utilized.  But certainly there has been receptiveness to the discussions, and we would hope to further our relationships with other providers as well.

The reason why it has been difficult to get a definitive answer from the SEC is this has implications to many corporations throughout the country because the GE Capital's, the Bank of America's, the Wells Fargo's  they all have these same provisions in the leases.  It's basically you have a material adverse event that is subjective in nature and therefore brings subjectivity into how you determine the  compute the 90 percent test.  So without getting too technical, it doesn't have  I don't think it has  if we were to restate as a result of a need to reclassify, it would not have  I don't believe would have a  I think it would have a very positive influence on our EBITDA, our enterprise value to EBITDA ratios.  And if you just use an 8 multiple, for example, it would reflect an increase in share price of approximately $10.
 
On the other hand, those that value the company based upon multiples of earnings per share  that one is fairly minimal in its effect.  It could be slightly decreased.  I think the initial calculation showed about a $0.17 per share shave on the 2010 results.  But that number is likely going to go down as we are still going through the buyouts and the dispositions that could result in gains and other deferrals of gains that would further reduce that.
 
So the reason why we chose to go ahead and file the Q with that uncertainty is we wanted to get the shareholders as much information as possible.  We hope to get an answer in the next few weeks from the SEC.  And if there is a delay in that, then we may have to make our best estimate of what we should do.  But it's  at least now this information is all out there and there's no delay in our filings.

ITEM 3.01    Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing
On November 11, 2011, Air Methods Corporation (the Company) received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff of the Nasdaq Stock Market (the Staff) stating that the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1).  The Company anticipated receiving such letter because, as previously disclosed, the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Form 10-Q) for the quarter ended September 30, 2011, which was filed on November 9, 2011 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) had not been reviewed by an independent public accountant in accordance with Statement of Auditing Standards No. 100, Interim Financial Information (SAS 100), thereby causing the Form 10-Q to be untimely filed with the SEC.
Under Nasdaq rules, the Company now has 60 calendar days to submit to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules. If Nasdaq accepts the Companys plan, then Nasdaq can grant up to 180 calendar days to the Company to regain compliance. The Company expects to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules prior to the date on which it would need to submit a plan to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules.
As previously disclosed, the Company is awaiting a response from the SEC regarding the appropriate GAAP interpretation of ASC 840-10-25-14, which may impact the Companys presentation for aircraft leases.  At this time, the Company is continuing to quantify the impact of a potential change in presentation of its aircraft leases, as well as correspond with the SEC.  Based on conversations with the SEC to date, the Company expects to hear from the SEC on or before December 1, 2011, but there are no guarantees that the SEC will issue any guidance on the issue by such date, or at any time.
A copy of the press release announcing receipt of the Staff letter is attached as
Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated by reference to this Item 3.01.
Certain statements contained in this Form 8-K are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements, include, without limitation, the timing for the Company to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules, statements regarding the timing and anticipated response of the SEC as to the lease accounting issue referenced herein, and the impact of such lease accounting issue on the Companys financial statements.  Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, review of the Companys financial statements by an independent registered public accounting firm; the possibility of a restatement or revision of the Companys financial statements, the Companys ability to regain compliance with Nasdaq listing rules and other matters set forth in the Companys filings with the SEC. The Company is under no obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Item 4.02(a) 
Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
As previously announced, Air Methods Corporation (the Company) was waiting for a response from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions Office of the Chief Accountant (the SEC) to its inquiry regarding the appropriate GAAP interpretation of the maximum amount that the Company could be required to pay as described in ASC 840-10-25-14, in the event of a non-performance-related default, for purposes of evaluating lease classification.  On November 18, 2011, the SEC indicated that it disagreed with the Companys past interpretation of the maximum amount that it could be required to pay in the event of a subjectively determined default in the Companys aircraft leases.  As a result, most of the Companys aircraft leases previously classified as operating leases will now be classified as capital leases in the Companys consolidated financial statements.
 
Based on the SECs response, on November 18, 2011, management concluded, after discussion with KPMG LLP, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, that the Company should restate its consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010 included in the Companys December 31, 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the consolidated interim financial statements included in the Companys Forms 10-Q as of and for the quarter and year to date periods ended March 31, 2011; June 30, 2011 and September 30, 2011, and related 2010 comparative prior quarter and year to date periods included in those Form 10-Qs, and accordingly, those financial statements should no longer be relied upon.
 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and members of the Companys management have discussed the matters disclosed in this Item 4.02(a) with KPMG LLP. The Company intends to file amended Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q/A as of and for the quarter and year to date periods, including the 2010 comparative prior year periods ended March 31, 2011; June 30, 2011 and September 30, 2011; and amended results for the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010 (reported within its Form 10-K for fiscal year 2010) before the end of December 2011 or as soon practicable thereafter.  In addition, the Company will be filing an amendment to its Form 8-K/A filed on October 17, 2011 to include the consolidated financial statements of OF Air Holdings Corporation, the consent of its independent registered public accounting firm, and to adjust the pro forma financial statements included therein as a result of the restated Air Methods Corporation financial statements.
 
Management has considered, and is continuing to evaluate, the effect of  the restatement on the Companys prior conclusions of the adequacy of its internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of each of the applicable restatement periods. The Company will amend any disclosures pertaining to its evaluation of such controls and procedures as appropriate in connection with filing the amendments to its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 and Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March 30, 2011; June 30, 2011, and September 30, 2011.

Exhibit 99.1
 
DENVER, CO., November 22, 2011  Air Methods Corporation (Nasdaq: AIRM) announced today that the Company will restate its financial results after receiving a response from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The SEC responded to the Companys previous request for guidance concerning the appropriate GAAP interpretation of the maximum amount that the Company could be required to pay as described in ASC 840-10-25-14, in the event of a non-performance-related default. As a result of the restatement, most of the Companys aircraft leases previously classified as operating leases will now be classified as capital leases in the Companys consolidated financial statements. The periods covered by the restatement are the year ended December 31, 2010 and the quarters ended March 31, 2011; June 30, 2011 and September 30, 2011.  The Company expects to file the restated financial statements before the end of December 2011 or as soon as practicable thereafter.
 
Based on the Companys preliminary calculations, the Company expects the earnings per share for fiscal year 2010 and the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 to decrease from $3.50 to approximately $3.37 and $2.70 to approximately $2.66, respectively.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for fiscal year 2010 and the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 is expected to increase by $48 million and
$36 million, respectively, while capital lease obligations as of September 30, 2011 are expected to increase by approximately $263 million.   KPMG LLP, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, and management are still in the process of reviewing these adjustments and therefore these amounts could change.
 
Aaron Todd, Air Methods chief executive officer, stated, We are respectful of the guidance we have just received from the SEC and will promptly adjust our accounting methodology to conform to this guidance.  While these changes will result in slight reductions in earnings per share (less than 4% for fiscal year 2010), the increase in EBITDA compared with the increase in capital lease obligations should more appropriately reflect the Companys enterprise value when computed based on multiples of EBITDA.
 
Additional information regarding the restatement is included in the Form 8-K filed by the Company on November 22, 2011 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Pilot(s) who currently receive IFR supplemental pay shall continue to do so for the duration of this agreement.
Appendix A, Section 8  Definitions
       The Pilots salary is based upon 182  work shifts per year.  A work shift is defined as a minimum of 12 and up to a fourteen (14) hours of duration.  A work shift does not include training, meetings and travel to or from training or meetings on an off work day.
Work Shift:
A Pilots annual annual rate of pay as identified in Appendix A, Section 1 and not including Supplemental Pay, ACCRA Geographical Differential Pay, Overtime Pay, Workover Shift Pay or any other additional compensation.
Base Pay:
  
        A Pilots base hourly rate shall be calculated by dividing his  base pay as identified in Appendix A, Section 1, by 2190 hours.
Base Hourly Rate:
    Is defined as one and one half (1 ) times a Pilots base hourly rate times twelve (12) hours.  Workover Pay does not include supplemental pay and ACCRA.
Workover Shift Pay:
  Is defined as the Base Hourly Rate (defined in Appendix A) times one and one half.
Overtime Hourly Rate:
   Is defined as being scheduled for and reporting for a potential revenue producing shift on a regularly scheduled day off that was not the result of a trade or swap.
Workover Shift:

Travel time is compensated but will not be counted toward hours worked (unless the Pilot is flying the aircraft to the disaster site).  Travel time will be the actual time of the trip and should not include any time zone adjustments.
FEMA (Short Notice) Disaster Response Pay:
A Pilot on flight status will be paid the workover hourly rate for hours worked while on shift.  A Pilot off flight status will be paid at the normal hourly rate of pay (which excludes supplemental pay) for the hours spent off shift.
 
46
 
 
When a Pilot is released by management from the disaster work site, they will be paid their normal rate (excluding supplemental pay) of pay until the first available flight lands at the home destination plus two (2) hours*.
*If an employee drives to and from the disaster area, travel time should be reported and verification from Mapquest.com should be provided with the timesheet documenting the estimated travel time.
A Pilot must log all travel time and work shifts while on disaster relief and provide a copy of their original work schedule (prior to disaster duty) to payroll.  A Pilot will not be paid for any missed shifts that they gave up due to covering in a disaster.

We hereby consent to the incorporation by reference in the Registration Statements on Form S-3 (No. 333.163467) and Form S-8 (Nos. 33-24980, 33-46691, 33-55750, 33-65370, 33-75742, 333-108599, 333-138771, and 333-168633) of Air Methods Corporation of our report dated July 26, 2011 relating to the financial statements of OF Air Holdings Corp. and Subsidiaries, which appears in this Amendment No. 2 to the Current Report on Form 8-K/A of Air Methods Corporation dated December 22, 2011.

Exhibit 99.3
 
1
 
The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are presented to reflect the acquisition of Omniflight by the Company using the acquisition method of accounting whereby the total estimated purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition based on their estimated fair values as of the effective date of the acquisition.
The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet presents the historical financial information of the Company, as of June 30, 2011, as adjusted for the acquisition of Omniflight, as if the transaction had occurred on June 30, 2011. The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined statements of income for the six months ended June 30, 2011, and the year ended December 31, 2010, combine the historical operations of the Company with the historical operations of Omniflight as if the transaction had occurred on January 1, 2010. Certain reclassifications have been made to the historical Omniflight financial statement presentation to conform to the Companys basis of presentation.
These pro forma statements may not be indicative of the results that actually would have occurred if the combination had been in effect on the dates indicated or which may be obtained in the future. The Company recorded approximately $250,000 in transaction costs related to the acquisition of Omniflight in its historical statement of income for the six months ended June 30, 2011, included in this pro forma presentation. In the year ending December 31, 2011, the Company expects to incur the following nonrecurring expenses relating to the acquisition and integration of Omniflight into the Companys operations: approximately $1.1 million in additional transaction costs, $1.4 million in stay bonuses and severance for Omniflight employees, and $2.8 million related to the consolidation of Omniflights Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate into the Companys certificate. These nonrecurring charges are not included in pro forma income statements included in this document.
The Company has restated most of its operating leases related to aircraft in its fleet that should have been classified as capital leases based upon certain provisions included in the aircraft lease agreements. Specifically, the leases have certain default clauses, including material adverse change, cross-default provisions and other provisions which are not objectively determinable or do not represent pre-defined criteria at the inception of the lease. As a result, the maximum consideration the Company could be required to pay the lessor in the event of a default is included in the lease payments for lease classification purposes at the inception of the lease. For these leases, the maximum consideration usually approximates or exceeds the cost of the aircraft at the inception of the lease and, when included in minimum lease payments for purposes of applying ASC 840-10-25-1(d) (i.e., the 90% test), results in capital lease classification, in accordance with the guidance for default covenants related to non-performance as discussed in ASC 840-10-25-14. The Company has made an accounting policy election to exclude the maximum consideration it could be required to pay the lessor in the event of default from the calculation of the present value of the minimum lease payments in measuring the capital lease asset and related obligation, since there is no likely scenario whereby an aircraft lessor would require the Company to pay the full stipulated loss value in the event of a non-performance-related default, and, therefore, this maximum consideration has a remote probability of payment.

As a result of the restatement, the Company has recorded additional capital lease assets and related capital lease obligations on the consolidated balance sheets. The impact of deferred rent and unfavorable lease liability related to the acquisition of CJ System Aviation Group, Inc., (CJ) in 2007 was also reversed from other assets, other accrued liabilities, and other liabilities. Goodwill associated with the acquisition of CJ was revised to reflect capital lease classification and appropriate fair value measurement of CJ leases as of the acquisition date. The Company also adjusted its deferred income tax liability to take into account the temporary differences created to reflect the capital lease obligations and assets for financial reporting purposes. Lease payments related to these aircraft are now recognized as principal reductions in the capital lease obligations and interest expense, rather than as aircraft rental expense. The consolidated statements of income also include depreciation on the capital lease assets over the terms of the respective leases. Rental expense related to the few remaining aircraft operating leases has now been combined into aircraft operations in the consolidated statements of income, due to immateriality.
Prior to the acquisition, Omniflights fiscal year-end was March 31. In the accompanying unaudited pro forma combined statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2010, Omniflights historical statement of income for the year ended March 31, 2011, was combined with the Companys statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2010. The unaudited pro forma combined statement of income for the six months ended June 30, 2011, includes the three months ended March 31, 2011, for Omniflight. These same three months are also included in the pro forma statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2010. Summarized operating information about the duplicated quarter is as follows:
The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements reflect the following adjustments:

To the Board of Directors of
 
OF Air Holdings Corp.:
 
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, preferred stock and stockholders deficit, and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of OF Air Holdings Corp. and its subsidiaries at March 31, 2011 and 2010 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.  As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is not currently in compliance with required covenants related to certain of the Companys term loans and its revolving line of credit.  This raises substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.  Managements plan to address this is also described in Note 1.  The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
 
As discussed in Note 2, the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2010 have been restated to correct an error.
 
As discussed in Note 16, on June 1, 2011, an agreement of sale was entered into by the Company.

March 31, 2011 and 2010
 
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.  The Company has incurred significant losses before taxes from operations.  As of March 31, 2011, the Company has $181.4 million in debt outstanding.  This includes $41.0 million which is due in fiscal 2012 including $3.7 million under the Companys $10.0 million revolving line of credit (2010 Revolver) and $7.7 million under the 2010 Term Loan A ("2010 Term Loan A") which matured on June 29, 2011 and $28.6 million in current year payments due on the Companys 2010 Term Loan B ("2010 Term Loan B").  The 2010 Revolver was utilized to fund working capital needs and is a component of the Companys working capital and cash management system.  The Company was unable to pay the full amount outstanding under the 2010 Term Loan A at the maturity date.
 
The Company's 2010 Revolver and 2010 Term Loan A were due on June 29, 2011 and June 30, 2011, respectively. The amounts were not paid when due and as a result the Companys lender has issued a Reservation of Rights letter to the Company noting it is in default and that the lender is considering its options while maintaining all of their current rights and remedies.  The Company's Subordinated Debt and Capital Lease Obligations include cross defaults which default those agreements if other borrowings including the Senior Debt are in default. This results in those obligations being in default and as a result are classified as current obligations.
 
The Company is currently considering its options with respect to the default conditions associated with their obligations referred to above. Management of the Company believes the pending sale of the Company as described in Note 16 will provide the liquidity necessary to satisfy the requirements of their obligations and remove the default conditions. Additionally, management of the Company has also been actively working with their current lenders with respect to their options under their obligations such as a possible extension or refinancing of the amounts due under their obligations. There is no assurance as to the completion of the sale or the Company's ability to refinance or extend their obligations. Accordingly, this raises substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.
 
The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence.

The Company has restated certain of their operating leases related to aircraft in their fleet that should have been classified as capital leases based upon certain provisions included in the agreements.
 
Specifically, the leases have events of default including material adverse change and cross default provisions which are not objectively determinable or do not represent pre-defined criteria at the inception of the lease.  As a result, the maximum consideration the Company could be required to pay the lessor in the event of a default is included in the lease payments for lease classification purposes at the inception of the lease.  For these leases, this amount usually approximates or exceeds the cost of the aircraft at the inception of the lease and results in capital lease classification.
 
The measurement of the amount recorded for the capital lease obligation is based upon the rent payments specified in the respective leases discounted using the Company's incremental borrowing rate at the inception of the lease.  The corresponding leased asset is depreciated over the term of the lease.
 
The amounts recorded as rental expense including the impact of straight line rents and the deferred gain of $4.6 million from the sale leaseback of aircraft in periods prior to April 1, 2009 were also reversed from accrued liabilities, deferred rent and other liabilities.  The Company also revised the presentation of their tax accounts to take into account the temporary differences created to reflect the capital lease obligation and assets for financial reporting purposes.  This had no net impact on the Company's tax provision as the Company has a full valuation allowance in place for all periods presented.
 
The Company's Term Loans, Revolver, and Subordinated Debt contain default provisions which do not allow for capital leases. This results in a default condition existing at the balance sheet date for both years presented. As the Company has not obtained a waiver for the condition, the Company's obligations are subject to being called by the lender and as a result are reflected as current obligations. Related debt acquisition costs are also classified as current.
 
The Company recorded the following adjustments to their March 31, 2010 accounts to reflect the correction of the error from the previous periods.

The Company also adjusted their accumulated deficit as of March 31, 2009 by $3,304,599.  This reflects the cumulative adjustment for all periods prior to April 1, 2009 on a net of tax basis for the affected capital leases.
 
The Company also corrected the presentation in the statement of cash flows for 2010 to reflect the reduction in the capital lease obligations as a financing cash outflow of $6,775,469, rather than as a component of operating cash flows.
 
 
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of OF Air Holdings Corp. (OF Air or the Company) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Kestrel Acquisition Corp. (KAC), Omniflight, Inc. (OI) and Omniflight Helicopters, Inc. (OHI).  The Company has numerous OHI subsidiaries, including Native Air Services, Inc. (NAS), Native American Air Ambulance, Inc. (NAAA or Native Air) and Enchantment Aviation, Inc. (Enchantment or Southwest Medevac).  Additionally, Native American Air Ambulance LLC, which is 49% owned by the Company has been consolidated in the accounts of OF Air due to the degree of control exercised by the Company. During fiscal 2011, the Company merged KAC and OI into OF Air to consolidate the number of legal entities. This had no impact on the Company's accounts.

  OF Air Holdings Corp. and Subsidiaries
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
  
March 31, 2011 and 2010
 
Business
The Company provides emergency healthcare and air medical transportation services to hospitals, medical centers, and other agencies throughout the United States.
 
Formation of Business
OF Air was formed on August 31, 2005 by affiliates of Wind Point Partners LLP, a private equity firm, for the purpose of acquiring all the outstanding stock of KAC (the parent company of OHI).  On October 31, 2005, all of the outstanding common stock of KAC was purchased by OF Air for a total purchase price of $196.1 million, net of debt assumed, of $9.8 million.
 
Sale of Flying A
On May 15, 2009, the Company sold the outstanding stock of Flying A for a total of $450,000 resulting in a gain of $122,000, not including selling costs.  The Flying A was originally purchased as part of the Southwest Medevac (SWME) stock acquisition on July 20, 2007.
 
 
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents are liquid investments that have original maturities of three months or less.
 
Concentration of Cash on Deposit and Uninsured Cash Balances
In the normal course of business, the Company maintains bank balances in excess of federally insured limits.  The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk to cash.
 
Revenue and Accounts Receivable
Fixed fee revenue under the Companys operating agreements with hospitals is recognized ratably on a monthly basis over the terms of the agreements.  Revenue relating to air operations and medical transport services is recognized upon completion of the services.  Revenue and accounts receivable are presented net of allowances for contracted discounts and uncompensated care based upon payer mix, payer reimbursement schedules and historical collection experience.  Estimates of contractual allowances and uncollectible receivables are initially determined based on historical collection rates and adjusted periodically based on actual collections.
 
Trade receivables are generally due within 30 days.  Receivables due from patients and third-party payor companies at March 31, 2011 and 2010, before allowances, were $85.4 million and $73.6 million.  Allowances have historically been within managements expectations.  Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation.  The Company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
 
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost.  All maintenance and repairs, including scheduled aircraft component overhauls and replacements, are expensed when incurred.  Major modifications and costs incurred to place aircraft in service are capitalized.  Improvements to leased helicopters are included in rotables in the accompanying financial statements.  Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method taking into consideration estimated values that will be realized upon sale or other disposition over the following estimated useful lives:

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
  
March 31, 2011 and 2010
 
 
Improvements to leased property and equipment are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease period or useful life of the improvements.  The original cost of rotables is capitalized and depreciated over a 6 year life.  Overhauls of aircraft and aircraft parts that extend the useful life are capitalized and depreciated over a 6 year life.
 
Capital Leases
Leases meeting certain capital lease criteria are capitalized and the present value of the related lease payments is recorded as a liability.  Assets under capital leases are capitalized using the Companys incremental borrowing rate at the inception of the lease.  Depreciation of capitalized leased assets is computed on the straight-line method over the lease term.
Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of medical supplies used in flight operations.  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (determined on an average cost basis) or market.  The Company provides reserves against inventories it believes to be slow moving or obsolete to state inventories at estimated net realizable value.
 
Long-lived Assets
The Company evaluates its long-lived assets in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, which requires reviewing long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate.  If long-lived assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded in the period the determination was made.
 
Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated selling costs.
 
Goodwill
Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired.  Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently as impairment indicators arise.  Impairment tests, which involve the use of estimates related to the fair market value of the business operations with which goodwill is associated, are performed annually at the end of the Companys fiscal year (See Note 7).

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
  
March 31, 2011 and 2010
 
Intangible Assets and Noncompetition Agreements
Intangible assets consist of trade names and independent and traditional customer relationships.  The trade names have been determined to have an indefinite useful life.  Intangible assets that are determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are evaluated annually for impairment.  Intangible assets with indefinite lives are also evaluated annually to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life.  Assets with finite lives are subject to amortization over the useful lives of the assets.  The useful lives have been determined based on the period over which the assets are expected to generate future cash flows.  The independent and traditional customer relationships are being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated average life of 5 years and 15 years, respectively.  The trade names are deemed to have an indefinite life and, accordingly, are not being amortized, but are subject to impairment testing on an annual basis in accordance with ASC 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (See Note 7).
 
Debt Issue Costs
Costs associated with debt issuances are capitalized and amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the terms of the related debt agreements.  Previously capitalized costs related to debt instruments which have been modified significantly or settled are treated in accordance with ASC 470 Debt.
 
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740Income TaxesASC 740 requires an asset and liability approach, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events, which have been recognized in the Companys financial statements or tax returns.  A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
 
.  
 
Effective April 1, 2009, the Company adopted accounting for uncertain tax positions (ASC 740-10-25), which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements.  The Company recognizes the tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities.  The tax benefits recognized from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement.  To the extent that the expected tax outcome of these matters changes, such changes in estimates will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made.  There was no impact as a result of the adoption of this standard.
 
Maintenance and Periodic Inspections
Maintenance and periodic inspections of aircraft and aircraft equipment that do not extend the aircrafts useful life are expensed when incurred.
 
Stock Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock based compensation under the provisions of ASC 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation.  Under the provisions of ASC 718, stock-based compensation expense is recognized for all stock option awards granted based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718.  The resulting compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Companys financial instruments consist primarily of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and debt instruments.  The carrying amounts of financial instruments other than debt instruments are representative of their fair values due to their short maturities.  Management estimates the fair value of their debt instruments by using current applicable rates for similar instruments.  Management believes the current stated rates for their debt approximate market rates given their current credit spreads for variable debt and the rate of interest on their fixed rate instruments. Management believes the fair value of their debt approximates its carrying value.
 
Reclassifications
Certain amounts on the prior year cash flow statement have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.  The reclassifications had no effect on net assets or net income.
 
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
 
 
On January 1, 2010, the Company entered into an agreement with Heli-One American Support, LLC (Heli-One) to outsource its regionally performed helicopter fleet heavy maintenance, inventory management and record keeping.  The Fleet Maintenance Support Agreement (FMSA) details the services to be provided by Heli-One for a period of 10 years (initial term of contract) under a Power by the Hour (PBH) arrangement for the materials management and record keeping, a labor rate for the maintenance services and a time and material rate for excluded services or upgrade items.  In addition, on January 1, 2010, the Company sold its aircraft parts inventory, rotable pool and certain tooling and maintenance equipment to Heli-One for a purchase price of approximately $6.0 million under an Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement (APA).  A loss of $2.8 was recorded on the sale.
 
On April 29, 2011, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with Heli-One to terminate all services provided by Heli-One under the FMSA effective March 31, 2011 and resolve any outstanding matters under the APA and FMSA.  The Company agreed to pay $2.0 million in settlement of all claims by Heli-One against the Company for all non-PBH rate services, material, and true-ups with respect to the FMSA through March 15, 2011. The Company had previously accrued $2.3 million related to these non-PBH services and recognized the difference between the settlement amount and the amount previously accrued as a reduction of the contract termination costs of $0.3 million.  The loss on contract termination also included the write-off of the remaining deferred inventory charge of $0.6 million resulting from the original sale of inventory to Heli-One that was previously being amortized over the life of the contract. As part of the agreement the Company agreed to forgive outstanding accounts receivable due from Heli-One, resulting in a write-off of outstanding receivables totaling $0.4 million. The Company also agreed that no further billings for reimbursable expenses would be issued to Heli-One. Reimbursable expenses not yet billed totaled $0.3 million for parts that were paid for by the Company that should have been covered under the FMSA. Heli-One was also absolved from any future buy-out credits resulting from future obligations to perform services. This resulted in a liability $0.4 million being recorded as certain obligations became the Company's due to the waiver of buy-out credits owed by Heli-One. The Company also incurred other miscellaneous costs to terminate the contract of $0.1 million. Finally as part of the agreement, the Company agreed to payment of $2.0 million for complete and final settlement and termination of the FMSA.

There were additional terms of the settlement that did not have an accounting impact as a result of the contract termination.  These items included the Companys payment of PBH charges for the months of February and March 2011 totaling $2.5 million, which were accrued and accounted for as power by the hour maintenance costs. Both parties also agreed to a non-solicitation of employees through the period ended January 1, 2013. With respect to parts and components that were in the Company's possession, Heli-One agreed to replace all rental components with components of a minimum build standard that were lien-free, provide parts owed for specified heavy maintenance activities, and allow the Company to submit an offer to purchase the consignment stock held at the Companys locations. The Company agreed and assigned future maintenance owed to the Company by a third party maintenance provider, Turbomeca, which the Company had previously incurred and paid as power by the hour maintenance costs. As part of the Heli-One settlement, the future maintenance to be provided to the Company was transferred to Heli-One.
 
 
In March 2011, the Company made the decision to sell some of its ventilators.  This medical equipment had a net book value of $131,000.  Management of the Company reduced the carrying value of the ventilators to their estimated fair value of $55,000 as of March 31, 2011 and segregated them from assets in service.  This resulted in a loss of $76,000.  Management of the Company made the decision to sell these assets to standardize the type of ventilator used across all of the bases.  Net proceeds from the sale of the ventilators will be applied towards the lease payments of new ventilators.
 
In October 2009, the Company made the decision to sell six aircraft in their fleet, as well as some related inventory.  These aircraft, and the related inventory, had a net book value of $2.4 million.  Management of the Company reduced the carrying value of these aircraft, and the related inventory, to their estimated fair value of $0.8 million as of March 31, 2010 and has segregated them from assets in service.  This resulted in a loss of $1.6 million.  Management of the Company made the decision to sell these assets to move to a more efficient aircraft as well as to streamline the fixed wing fleet.  Net proceeds of $0.8 million from the sale of these aircraft were used to reduce amounts due under the Companys credit agreements and supplement working capital needs.
 
On March 9, 2009, the Company made the decision to sell seven aircraft in their fleet.  These aircraft had a net book value of $5.1 million.  Management of the Company reduced the carrying value of these aircraft to their estimated fair value of $2.6 million as of March 31, 2009 and has segregated them from assets in service.  This resulted in a loss of $2.5 million.  Management of the Company made the decision to sell these assets to move to more efficient aircraft and eliminate excess capacity in their fleet.  All seven of these aircraft were sold in fiscal 2010 for $2.3 million.  Net proceeds from the sale of these aircraft were used to reduce amounts due under the Companys credit agreements.

Stock Options
In June 2007, the Companys board of directors approved the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (2007 Plan) which provides for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and other stock awards to employees, directors, and advisors.  The maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be made subject to awards under the 2007 Plan is 55,000.  The 2007 Plan is administered by a committee of the Companys board of directors which has discretion to select the persons to participate in the 2007 Plan, determine the size and type of award, determine the terms and conditions of the awards in a manner consistent with the 2007 Plan, specify the exercise price and term of any option granted, provided that the term may not exceed ten years.
 
During the year ended March 31, 2009, options to purchase 36,500 shares of stock, with an exercise price of $1.00, were granted at a weighted average fair value of $0.39.  During the years ended March 31, 2011 and March 31, 2010 a total of 1,500 and 7,500 options, respectively, were cancelled.  As of March 31, 2011 there are 6,900 vested options and a total of 11,500 outstanding options.  The Company recognized no stock-based compensation expense during the years ended March 31, 2011 and March 31, 2010.  Total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based awards as of March 31, 2011, was $1,854 and is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average vesting term of 1.58 years.  These amounts were determined based upon managements estimate of the fair value of the options on the grant date as prescribed under ASC 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation.
 
Stock Appreciation Rights
In November 2008, the Companys board of directors approved the 2008 Stock Appreciation Rights Plan (2008 SARs Plan) which provides for the granting of stock appreciation rights to employees, officers, directors, and consultants.  The 2008 Plans Administrator (Administrator) is authorized to determine the eligible persons to whom and the time or times at which such awards shall be granted and to impose such terms, limitations, restrictions and conditions upon any such award.  The stock appreciation rights (SARs) may be granted individually or in tandem with other types of awards.
 
Each individual grant specifies a participation percentage being awarded to the grantee.  This participation percentage is to be applied, upon the sale of the Company to an independent third party, to the difference between the aggregate consideration received upon the sale and an aggregate baseline equity value.  The aggregate baseline equity value is the sum of a beginning baseline value of $53.5 million plus or minus equity contributions and distributions and an accrued return on the aggregate baseline equity value at 10% per annum, compounded annually.  In lieu of receiving cash, the grantee may elect to receive shares of common stock at any time prior to the consummation of the sale.
 
At March 31, 2011, five employees, three former employees, two board members and one nonemployee had received grants with a total participation factor of 10.6%.  These grants are scheduled to vest through January 2014 or upon the sale of the company.  The total vested participation percentage at March 31, 2011 is 4.98%.  The Company does not believe these grants will have a material impact on the financial statements.

EXHIBIT 99.1
DENVER, Feb. 29, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Air Methods Corporation (Nasdaq:AIRM), the global leader in air medical transportation, reported revenue and net income for the year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2011.
For the year, revenue increased 18% to $660.5 million compared to $562.0 million in the prior year. Net income increased 9% to $46.6 million, or $3.63 per diluted share, in the current year from $42.8 million, or $3.39 per diluted share, in the prior year. Earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization, and income tax expenses (EBITDA) increased 13% to $170.9 million compared to $150.7 million in the prior year.    
For the fourth quarter, revenue increased 29% to $193.3 million as compared with $150.4 million during the prior-year period. Net income decreased slightly to $12.4 million, or $0.96 per diluted share, compared to net income of $12.5 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. EBITDA increased 15% to $47.8 million compared to $41.5 million in the prior-year quarter. 
On August 1, 2011, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of OF Air Holdings Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Omniflight Helicopters, Inc. (together, Omniflight). The results of operations for the year and quarter ended December 31, 2011 include the consolidated operations of Omniflight since the date of the acquisition. Pre-tax earnings were reduced by approximately $2.3 million and $0.5 million for the year and fourth quarter, respectively, for transaction costs and employee severance expenses related to the acquisition of Omniflight. Pre-tax earnings for both periods were further reduced by $2.2 million for retrospective compensation paid to pilots associated with the negotiation of a new collective bargaining agreement. The quarter ended December 31, 2011 also included $0.3 million and $0.9 million in pre-tax expense associated with the financial restatement and asset dispositions, respectively. 
Fourth Quarter Highlights
Revenue from Community-Based Services increased 44% to $134.4 million from $93.6 million, while segment net income increased 17% to $25.8 million during the fourth quarter, as compared with segment net income of $22.0 million in the prior-year quarter. Net revenue per community-based transport increased 10% to $10,099 compared with $9,175 in the prior-year quarter. Total community-based patient transports increased 30% to 13,128 in the current-year quarter from 10,071 in the prior-year quarter. Community-based patient transports for bases open greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) and excluding Omniflight transports decreased 10%, or 1,031 transports, as compared with the prior-year quarter. Weather cancellations for these same-base locations decreased by 105 transports compared with the prior-year quarter.
Revenue from Hospital-Based Services increased by 3% to $50.5 million from $49.1 million, while segment net income decreased to $1.6 million in the current-year quarter from $2.8 million during the prior-year quarter. This decrease in earnings is attributed primarily to the retrospective pilot compensation referenced above.
Consolidated maintenance expense for the current-year quarter increased by only 16%, or $3.6 million, despite an increase in flight volume of 22%. Fuel costs for community-based operations increased $2.2 million during the current-year quarter as compared to the prior-year quarter, representing a 74% increase. This increase is attributed to a 30% increase in community-based patient transports and $0.5 million pre-tax loss associated with mark-to market of 2011 and 2012 fuel hedges.    
Revenue from our United Rotorcraft (formerly Products) Division, excluding revenue generated from internal projects, increased to $8.4 million from $7.7 million in the prior-year quarter, a 9% increase. Segment net income, excluding internal projects, decreased to $1.3 million from $2.2 million in the prior-year quarter.
The Company also provided an update on preliminary January 2012 flight volume and net revenue per community-based transport. Total community-based transports during January 2012 were 4,167 compared with 2,842 during January 2011, reflecting a 47% increase. Same-Base Transports (excluding Omniflight transports) for January decreased 6 transports, or less than 1%, while weather cancellations for these same bases decreased by 512 transports. Preliminary net revenue per community-based transport during January 2012 increased to $10,118 compared with $9,049 during January 2011, a 12% increase.  
Aaron Todd, Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are pleased with the annual and quarterly results in light of Omniflight transaction and transition costs and the upfront expense associated with our successful negotiation of a new collective bargaining agreement with our pilots. We are pleased with the increases to earnings and EBITDA that the Omniflight acquisition has produced to-date. We are essentially complete with our transition activities and look forward to the benefit of a full year of combined operations, with fully-realized synergies and elimination of costs associated with the acquisition and transition. Recent softness in Same-Base Transports has been more than offset by better than anticipated reimbursement. Mild weather in January, combined with continued strength in reimbursement, has given us a strong start for the first month of 2012."

The information contained in this report, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,nor shall information be deemed incorporated by reference in any registration statement, proxy statement, or other report filed under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, unless the Company specifically incorporates that information into those documents by reference.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(d) The following exhibit is filed as part of this report:
99.1 Press Release dated May 3, 2012.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
DENVER, May 3, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Air Methods Corporation (Nasdaq:AIRM), the global leader in air medical transportation, reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 and provided an update on April 2012 flight volume. For the quarter, revenue increased 45% to $190.8 million from $131.9 million in the prior-year quarter. Net income for the first quarter of 2012 was $12.5 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, compared with net income of $5.7 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2011. The current-year quarter includes the consolidated results of operations of OF Air Holdings Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Omniflight Helicopters, Inc. (together, Omniflight), which was acquired on August 1, 2011. The prior-year quarter included a pre-tax, non-cash gain of $1.0 million for the mark to market of a fuel derivative, compared with a gain of less than $0.1 million in the current-year quarter. Earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses (EBITDA) increased by 55%, to $46.6 million in the current-year quarter from $30.1 million in the prior-year quarter. (See the table at the end of this release for a reconciliation of EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, to GAAP.)
Community-based patient transports were 12,673 during the current-year quarter, compared with 8,870 in the prior-year quarter, a 43% increase. Patients transported for community bases in operation greater than one year and excluding Omniflight bases (Same-Base Transports) decreased by 3%, or 258 transports, while weather cancellations for these same bases decreased by 935 transports compared with the prior-year quarter. Requests for community-based service decreased 7% for bases open greater than one year. Net revenue per community-based transport increased 17% from $8,837 to $10,303 in the current-year quarter reflecting current and prior-year price increases.   
Maintenance expense increased $7.3 million, or 39%, compared with the prior-year quarter, while flight hours increased 30%. Increase in maintenance expense per flight hour is attributed to typical quarterly fluctuations associated with scheduled and unscheduled maintenance events.  Fuel expense increased by $1.8 million, or 47% (excluding effect of fuel derivatives), compared with the prior-year quarter. This increase is attributed to a 43% increase in community-based patient transports and the impact of fuel price increases.
For the first quarter, community-based divisional revenue increased 65% to $132.0 million, compared to $80.0 million in the prior year, while segment net income increased to $25.3 million from $10.3 million. Hospital-based divisional revenue increased 12% to $51.6 million from $46.1 million in the prior-year period, while segment net income decreased to $0.8 million compared with $3.8 million in the prior-year quarter. The decrease in hospital-based segment net income was primarily attributed to increase in aircraft maintenance expense of $3.6 million. United Rotorcraft Division's external revenue increased 25% to $7.2 million compared with $5.8 million in the prior-year quarter, while its external segment net income increased by $0.7 million as compared with the prior-year quarter. 
The Company also provided an update on preliminary April 2012 flight volume. Total community-based transports increased 48% to 4,745 during April 2012, compared with 3,215 in April 2011. April 2012 Same-Base Transports increased by 88 transports, or 3%, as compared with April 2011. Weather cancellations during April 2012 for these same bases decreased by 327 compared with the prior-year month. 
Aaron Todd, CEO, stated, "We are pleased with the strong start to our 2012 fiscal year. The clear benefit of our acquisition of Omniflight is reflected in these results, as we have now essentially concluded the integration of our two companies. Favorable impact of milder weather conditions, combined with higher than anticipated reimbursement rates, have more than offset higher maintenance expenditures and fuel expenses during the quarter. Although requests for service for bases open greater than one year declined 7% during the first quarter, this decline was only 2.5% during April 2012, compared with the prior-year period. We are ahead of pace to achieve our budgeted earnings expectations." 
The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern. Interested parties can access the call by dialing (877) 883-0656 (domestic) or (706) 643-8826 (international) or by accessing the web cast at www.airmethods.com.

: Forward-looking statements in this news release are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements in this press release that are "forward-looking statements" are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, the size, structure and growth of the Company's air medical services and United Rotorcraft Division; the collection rates for patient transports; the continuation and/or renewal of air medical service contracts; the ability of the Company to successfully finalize the integration of Omniflight; the anticipated synergies associated with the acquisition of Omniflight; extreme weather conditions across the U.S., and other matters set forth in the Company's filings with the SEC.  The Company is under no obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Forward Looking Statements
This press release discusses EBITDA, which is not calculated in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).  The Company defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and gain or loss on disposition of assets. A table is provided in this press release to reconcile such non-GAAP financial measure to net income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. Such table below includes all information reasonably available to the Company at the date of this press release and adjustments that the Company can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include, but are not limited to, acquisitions and divestitures of businesses and goodwill and other asset impairments.
About Non-GAAP Financial Information:
To supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, management believes that this non-GAAP measure provides useful information about the Company's core operating results and thus is appropriate to enhance the overall understanding of the Company's past financial performance and its prospects for the future. Management believes the additions and subtractions from net income used to calculate EBITDA reflect the measurements that its bank creditors and third party stock analysts use in evaluating the Company. These adjustments to the Company's GAAP results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of the Company's underlying operational results and trends and performance. Management uses this non-GAAP measure to evaluate the Company's financial results. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to financial results determined in accordance with GAAP.

DENVER, July 18, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Air Methods Corporation (Nasdaq:AIRM), the global leader in air medical transportation, reported that preliminary 2012 second quarter earnings significantly exceed expectations. Preliminary fully-diluted earnings per share are expected to range between $2.30 and $2.40 for the quarter ended June 30, 2012. Prior-year second quarter fully-diluted earnings per share were $0.77. Preliminary earnings improvement above original expectations is attributed to growth in same-base transports, improved reimbursement for community-based transports, and lower maintenance expense per flight hour.
Total community-based patient transports were 15,134 during the current-year quarter, compared with 10,309 in the prior-year quarter, a 47% increase. This growth primarily reflects additional transports associated with the Company's acquisition of OF Air Holdings and its subsidiaries (together, Omniflight) effective August 1, 2011, as well as from new community-based expansions. Patients transported for community bases in operation greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) increased 290 transports or 3%, while weather cancellations for these same bases decreased by 1,070 transports compared with the prior-year quarter.
Preliminary net revenue per community-based transport for the second quarter of 2012 increased 18% to $10,619 compared with the prior-year second quarter result of $9,008 per transport. Net revenue per community-based transport for the second quarter of 2012 increased 3% compared with the first quarter of 2012. 
Preliminary maintenance expense reflects a slight reduction compared with the prior-year quarter, despite a 34% increase in flight hours.
The Company noted that these preliminary results are subject to final quarter-end closing and review procedures and are therefore subject to change. 
Aaron Todd, CEO, stated, "The full benefit of our acquisition of Omniflight is reflected in these preliminary quarterly results. Fewer weather cancellations, continued strength within our net reimbursement per transport, and moderating maintenance expenditures have driven strong organic growth as well. Because the second half of 2012 will continue to benefit from our acquisition of Omniflight, due in part to the elimination of transaction and severance costs expensed during the second half of 2011, we anticipate continued added growth above normal organic growth expectations."
The Company expects to report financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2012 after the close of the market on Thursday, August 2, 2012. The Company has scheduled a conference call for Thursday, August 2, 2012 at 4:15 p.m. Eastern to discuss these results. Interested parties can access the call by dialing (877) 883-0656 (domestic) or (706) 643-8826 (international) or by accessing the web cast at www.airmethods.com.

EXHIBIT 99.1
DENVER, Aug. 2, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Air Methods Corporation (Nasdaq:AIRM), the global leader in air medical transportation, reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 and provided an update on July 2012 community-based patient transports. For the quarter, revenue increased 48% from $150.2 million to $222.5 million in the current-year quarter. For the six-month period, revenue increased 47% to $413.3 million, compared with $282.1 million in the prior-year six-month period. Financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 include operations associated with the Company's acquisition of OF Air Holdings and its subsidiaries (together, Omniflight) effective August 1, 2011.
For the quarter, net income increased 217% to $31.4 million, or $2.43 per diluted share, as compared with prior-year second quarter net income of $9.9 million, or $0.77 per diluted share. Net income for the six-month period increased 181% to $43.9 million, or $3.39 per diluted share, compared to $15.6 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, for the prior-year six-month period. The current-year second quarter results include pre-tax severance expenses of $1.1 million ($0.05 per share after tax effect).
For the second quarter, community-based revenue increased 72% to $161.9 million compared to $94.1 million in the prior year, while segment net income increased 178% to $54.5 million from $19.6 million. Total community-based patient transports increased by 47% to 15,134, as compared with 10,309 in the prior-year quarter. Community-based patient transports for bases open greater than one year and excluding Omniflight bases (Same-Base Transports) increased 3% or 296 patient transports, as compared with the prior-year quarter. Weather cancellations for these same base locations decreased by 1,070 compared with the prior-year quarter. Net revenue per community-based transport was $10,609 for the current-year quarter, compared with $9,008 in the prior-year quarter, an 18% increase. Hospital-based revenue increased by 9% to $53.0 million compared to $48.6 million in the prior-year period, while segment net income increased 155% to $4.6 million from $1.8 million. External revenue within the United Rotorcraft division was unchanged at $7.5 million compared with the prior-year quarter, while external segment net income decreased by 33% to $0.9 million in the current-year quarter. Consolidated maintenance expense decreased by $0.3 million or 1%, as compared with the prior-year quarter, despite a 34% increase in flight volume. Fuel expense per flight hour was unchanged during the quarter, compared with the prior-year period. 
The Company also provided an update on preliminary July 2012 flight volume. Total community-based transports were 5,053 during July 2012, compared with 3,785 in July 2011, a 34% increase. Same-Base Transports during the month of July decreased by 157 transports, or 4%, as compared with July 2011, while weather cancellations decreased by 36, as compared with the prior-year month for these same bases.    
Aaron Todd, CEO, stated, "During our second quarter, growth in Same-Base Transports attributed to milder weather, increase in net revenue per community-based transport, decrease in maintenance expense per flight hour, and the accretive financial performance of our Omniflight acquisition have combined to create strong top-line and bottom-line results. The Company continues to enjoy solid organic growth as well. Excluding revenue generated from Omniflight operating bases, our revenue would have grown 22%. We remain very optimistic for continued strength in our operating results for the remainder of 2012, especially when considering that the second half of 2012 will benefit from a full six months of combined operations and the non-recurrence of transaction and severance costs associated with the Omniflight acquisition."
The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern.

Section 409A Savings Clause
 
(a)           It is the intention of the parties that compensation or benefits payable under this Agreement not be subject to the additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A of the Code and this Agreement shall be interpreted accordingly.  To the extent such potential payments or benefits could become subject to additional tax under such Section, the parties shall cooperate to amend this Agreement with the goal of giving Executive the economic benefits described herein in a manner that does not result in such tax being imposed.
 
(b)           Each payment or benefit made pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a separate payment for purposes of Code Section 409A and each payment made in installments shall be treated as a series of separate payments for purposes of Code Section 409A, to the extent permitted under applicable law.  In addition, payments or benefits pursuant to Section 5 shall be exempt from the requirements of Code Section 409A to the maximum extent possible as short-term deferrals pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), as involuntary separation pay pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), as exempt reimbursements under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v), and/or under any other exemption that may be applicable, and this Agreement shall be construed accordingly.
 
(c)           For purposes of this Agreement, phrases such as termination of employment, when used to describe when cash severance payments may be made, shall be deemed to mean separation from service, as defined in Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.  For clarity, if Executive ceases to be an employmee but does not incur a separation from service under Code Section 409A, the Company shall calculate the amount of cash severance pay under Section 5 based on the date of Executives state law employment termination, but such cash severance pay will only be paid at such time as Executive incurs a separation from service under Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

(e)           All taxable reimbursements provided hereunder that are deferred compensation subjet to the requirements of Code Section 409A shall be made not later than the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred.   Any such taxable reimbursements or any taxable in-kind benefits provided in one calendar year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits to be provided in any other taxable year.
 
20.           .
Excise Tax Provisions
 
(a)           Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of Executive (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise)  (a ) including, by example and not by way of limitation, acceleration (by the Company or otherwise) of the date of vesting or payment under any plan, program, arrangement or agreement of the Company, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999 or any interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax together with any such interest and penalties, shall be referred to as the ), then there shall be made a calculation under which such Payments provided to Executive are reduced to the extent necessary so that no portion thereof shall be subject to the Excise Tax (the ).  A comparison shall then be made between (A) Executives Net After-Tax Benefit (as defined below) assuming application of the 4999 Limit; and (B) Executives Net After-Tax Benefit without application of the 4999 Limit.  If (B) exceeds (A) by $50,000 or more, then no limit on the Payments shall be imposed by this Section 20.  Otherwise, the amount payable to Executive shall be reduced so that no such Payment is subject to the Excise Tax.   shall mean the sum of (x) all payments that Executive receives or is entitled to receive that are in the nature of compensation and contingent on a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b)(2) (either, a ), less (y) the amount of federal, state, local and employment taxes and Excise Tax (if any) imposed with respect to such payments.

(b)           In the event that a reduction in Payments is required pursuant to this Section, then, except as provided below with respect to Payments that consist of health and welfare benefits, the reduction in Payments shall be implemented by determining the Parachute Payment Ratio (as defined below) for each Payment and then reducing the Payments in order beginning with the Payment with the highest Parachute Payment Ratio.  For Payments with the same Parachute Payment Ratio, such Payments shall be reduced based on the time of payment of such Payments, with amounts being paid furthest in the future being reduced first.  For Payments with the same Parachute Payment Ratio and the same time of payment, such Payments shall be reduced on a pro-rata basis (but not below zero) prior to reducing Payments next in order for reduction.  For purposes of this Section,  shall mean a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the applicable Payment as determined for purposes of Code Section 280G, and the denominator of which is the financial present value of such Parachute Payment, determined at the date such payment is treated as made for purposes of Code Section 280G (the ).  In determining the denominator for purposes of the preceding sentence (1) present values shall be determined using the same discount rate that applies for purposes of discounting payments under Code Section 280G; (2) the financial value of payments shall be determined generally under Q&A 12, 13 and 14 of Treasury Regulation 1.280G-1; and (3) other reasonable valuation assumptions as determined by the Company shall be used.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Payments that consist of health and welfare benefits shall be reduced after all other Payments, with health and welfare Payments being made furthest in the future being reduced first.  Upon any assertion by the Internal Revenue Service that any such Payment is subject to the Excise Tax, Executive shall be obligated to return to the Company any portion of the Payment determined by the Professional Services Firm to be necessary to appropriately reduce the Payment so as to avoid any such Excise Tax.

(c)            All determinations required to be made under this Section 20, including whether and when a Payment is cut back pursuant to Section 20(a) and the amount of such cut-back, and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by a professional services firm designated by the Board that is experienced in performing calculations under Section 280G (the ) which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and Executive.  If the Professional Services Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Section 280G Transaction, the Board shall appoint another qualified professional services firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Professional Services Firm hereunder).  All fees and expenses of the Professional Services Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.

In exchange for my right to receive payments and other benefits under Section 5 of my Employment Agreement, I agree to give up all My Claims against the Employer and give up all other actions, causes of action, claims or administrative complaints that I have against the Employer.  I will not bring any lawsuits or administrative claims against the Employer relating to the claims that I have released nor will I allow any lawsuits or claims to be brought or continued on my behalf or in my name.  The money and other consideration I receive pursuant to Section 5(b) or (c) of my Employment Agreement is a full and fair payment for the release of My Claims and the Employer does not owe me anything further for My Claims.  Separate from this agreement, I will also receive the Accrued Obligations (as defined in my Employment Agreement).

My decision to sign or not to sign this Release is my own voluntary decision made with full knowledge that the Employer has advised me to consult with an attorney.

I am legally able and entitled to receive the entire sum of money being paid to me by the Employer in settlement of My Claims.  I have not assigned or pledged any of My Claims or any portion of them to any third person.  I am a resident of the State of Colorado and have executed this Release within the State of Colorado.  I understand and agree that this Release contains all the agreements between the Employer and me relating to this settlement, and that it supersedes all prior negotiations and agreements relating to the subject matter hereof.
 
 
I understand that I have twenty-one (21) days from the day that I receive this Release, not counting the day upon which I receive it, to consider whether I wish to sign this Release.  If I cannot make up my mind in that time, the Employer may or may not allow more time.  I acknowledge that if I sign this Release before the end of the twenty-one (21) day period, it will be my personal, voluntary decision to do so.
 
 
I understand that I may rescind (that is, cancel) this Release for any reason within seven (7) calendar days after I sign and deliver it to the Employer.  I understand that my notice rescinding this agreement must be in writing and hand-delivered or mailed to the Employer.  If mailed, my notice rescinding this agreement must be:

Nothing herein shall prohibit any party (1) from disclosing that I am no longer employed by the Company; (2) from responding truthfully to any governmental investigation, legal process or inquiry related thereto, (3) from making traditional competitive statements in the course of promoting a competing business (other than in violation of Sections 5 or 6 of the Employment Agreement); or (4) from making a good faith rebuttal of the other partys untrue or misleading statement.
 
 
A-3
 
 
 
Sections 6 through 15 and 17 through 23 of the Employment Agreement (but subject to Executives right to receive the payments and benefits provided under Section 5 of the Employment Agreement) shall survive the termination of my employment and are incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth.
 
 
This Release shall be deemed to have been executed and delivered within the State of Colorado, and my rights and obligations and the rights and obligations of the Employer hereunder shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and governed by, the laws of the State of Colorado without regard to principles of conflict of laws.
 
 
Any dispute or controversy arising out of interpretation or enforcement of this Release shall be resolved pursuant to the terms set forth in Section 22 of the Employment Agreement.
 
 
If any provision of this Release is declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid for any reason, such invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions.  On the contrary, such remaining provisions shall be fully severable, and this Release shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid provisions never had been inserted in the Release.

Section 409A Savings Clause
 
(a)           It is the intention of the parties that compensation or benefits payable under this Agreement not be subject to the additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A of the Code and this Agreement shall be interpreted accordingly.  To the extent such potential payments or benefits could become subject to additional tax under such Section, the parties shall cooperate to amend this Agreement with the goal of giving Executive the economic benefits described herein in a manner that does not result in such tax being imposed.
 
(b)           Each payment or benefit made pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a separate payment for purposes of Code Section 409A and each payment made in installments shall be treated as a series of separate payments for purposes of Code Section 409A, to the extent permitted under applicable law.  In addition, payments or benefits pursuant to Section 5 shall be exempt from the requirements of Code Section 409A to the maximum extent possible as short-term deferrals pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), as involuntary separation pay pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), as exempt reimbursements under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v), and/or under any other exemption that may be applicable, and this Agreement shall be construed accordingly.
 
(c)           For purposes of this Agreement, phrases such as termination of employment, when used to describe when cash severance payments may be made, shall be deemed to mean separation from service, as defined in Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.  For clarity, if Executive ceases to be an employmee but does not incur a separation from service under Code Section 409A, the Company shall calculate the amount of cash severance pay under Section 5 based on the date of Executives state law employment termination, but such cash severance pay will only be paid at such time as Executive incurs a separation from service under Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.
 
 
12
 
 
(d)           If Executive is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code and would receive any payment sooner than 6 months after Executives separation from service that, absent the application of this Section 19(d), would be subject to additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A of the Code as a result of such status as a specified employee, then such payment shall instead be payable on the date that is five (5) days following the earliest to occur of (i) 6 months after Executives separation from service, or (ii) Executives death.
 
(e)           All taxable reimbursements provided hereunder that are deferred compensation subjet to the requirements of Code Section 409A shall be made not later than the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred.   Any such taxable reimbursements or any taxable in-kind benefits provided in one calendar year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits to be provided in any other taxable year.
 
20.           .
Excise Tax Provisions
 
(a)           Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of Executive (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise)  (a ) including, by example and not by way of limitation, acceleration (by the Company or otherwise) of the date of vesting or payment under any plan, program, arrangement or agreement of the Company, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999 or any interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax together with any such interest and penalties, shall be referred to as the ), then there shall be made a calculation under which such Payments provided to Executive are reduced to the extent necessary so that no portion thereof shall be subject to the Excise Tax (the ).  A comparison shall then be made between (A) Executives Net After-Tax Benefit (as defined below) assuming application of the 4999 Limit; and (B) Executives Net After-Tax Benefit without application of the 4999 Limit.  If (B) exceeds (A) by $50,000 or more, then no limit on the Payments shall be imposed by this Section 20.  Otherwise, the amount payable to Executive shall be reduced so that no such Payment is subject to the Excise Tax.   shall mean the sum of (x) all payments that Executive receives or is entitled to receive that are in the nature of compensation and contingent on a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b)(2) (either, a ), less (y) the amount of federal, state, local and employment taxes and Excise Tax (if any) imposed with respect to such payments.

(b)           In the event that a reduction in Payments is required pursuant to this Section, then, except as provided below with respect to Payments that consist of health and welfare benefits, the reduction in Payments shall be implemented by determining the Parachute Payment Ratio (as defined below) for each Payment and then reducing the Payments in order beginning with the Payment with the highest Parachute Payment Ratio.  For Payments with the same Parachute Payment Ratio, such Payments shall be reduced based on the time of payment of such Payments, with amounts being paid furthest in the future being reduced first.  For Payments with the same Parachute Payment Ratio and the same time of payment, such Payments shall be reduced on a pro-rata basis (but not below zero) prior to reducing Payments next in order for reduction.  For purposes of this Section,  shall mean a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the applicable Payment as determined for purposes of Code Section 280G, and the denominator of which is the financial present value of such Parachute Payment, determined at the date such payment is treated as made for purposes of Code Section 280G (the ).  In determining the denominator for purposes of the preceding sentence (1) present values shall be determined using the same discount rate that applies for purposes of discounting payments under Code Section 280G; (2) the financial value of payments shall be determined generally under Q&A 12, 13 and 14 of Treasury Regulation 1.280G-1; and (3) other reasonable valuation assumptions as determined by the Company shall be used.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Payments that consist of health and welfare benefits shall be reduced after all other Payments, with health and welfare Payments being made furthest in the future being reduced first.  Upon any assertion by the Internal Revenue Service that any such Payment is subject to the Excise Tax, Executive shall be obligated to return to the Company any portion of the Payment determined by the Professional Services Firm to be necessary to appropriately reduce the Payment so as to avoid any such Excise Tax.

(c)          All determinations required to be made under this Section 20, including whether and when a Payment is cut back pursuant to Section 20(a) and the amount of such cut-back, and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by a professional services firm designated by the Board that is experienced in performing calculations under Section 280G (the ) which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and Executive.  If the Professional Services Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Section 280G Transaction, the Board shall appoint another qualified professional services firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Professional Services Firm hereunder).  All fees and expenses of the Professional Services Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.

In exchange for my right to receive payments and other benefits under Section 5 of my Employment Agreement, I agree to give up all My Claims against the Employer and give up all other actions, causes of action, claims or administrative complaints that I have against the Employer.  I will not bring any lawsuits or administrative claims against the Employer relating to the claims that I have released nor will I allow any lawsuits or claims to be brought or continued on my behalf or in my name.

I have read this Release carefully and understand its terms.  I am hereby being advised by the Employer to consult with an attorney prior to signing this Release.  My decision to sign or not to sign this Release is my own voluntary decision made with full knowledge that the Employer has advised me to consult with an attorney.

I am old enough to sign this Release and to be legally bound by the agreements that I am making.  I represent that I have not filed for personal bankruptcy or been involved in any personal bankruptcy proceeding between the time any of My Claims accrued and date of my signature below.  I am legally able and entitled to receive the entire sum of money being paid to me by the Employer in settlement of My Claims.  I have not assigned or pledged any of My Claims or any portion of them to any third person.  I am a resident of the State of Colorado and have executed this Release within the State of Colorado.  I understand and agree that this Release contains all the agreements between the Employer and me relating to this settlement, and that it supersedes all prior negotiations and agreements relating to the subject matter hereof.
 
 
I understand that I have twenty-one (21) days from the day that I receive this Release, not counting the day upon which I receive it, to consider whether I wish to sign this Release.  If I cannot make up my mind in that time, the Employer may or may not allow more time.  I acknowledge that if I sign this Release before the end of the twenty-one (21) day period, it will be my personal, voluntary decision to do so.
 
 
I understand that I may rescind (that is, cancel) this Release for any reason within seven (7) calendar days after I sign and deliver it to the Employer.  I understand that my notice rescinding this agreement must be in writing and hand-delivered or mailed to the Employer.  If mailed, my notice rescinding this agreement must be:

Nothing herein shall prohibit any party (1) from disclosing that I am no longer employed by the Company; (2) from responding truthfully to any governmental investigation, legal process or inquiry related thereto, (3) from making traditional competitive statements in the course of promoting a competing business (other than in violation of Sections 5 or 6 of the Employment Agreement); or (4) from making a good faith rebuttal of the other partys untrue or misleading statement.

Sections 6 through 15 and 17 through 23 of the Employment Agreement (but subject to Executives right to receive the payments and benefits provided under Section 5 of the Employment Agreement) shall survive the termination of my employment and are incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth.
 
 
This Release shall be deemed to have been executed and delivered within the State of Colorado, and my rights and obligations and the rights and obligations of the Employer hereunder shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and governed by, the laws of the State of Colorado without regard to principles of conflict of laws.
 
 
Any dispute or controversy arising out of interpretation or enforcement of this Release shall be resolved pursuant to the terms set forth in Section 22 of the Employment Agreement.

Section 409A Savings Clause
 
(a)            It is the intention of the parties that compensation or benefits payable under this Agreement not be subject to the additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A of the Code and this Agreement shall be interpreted accordingly.  To the extent such potential payments or benefits could become subject to additional tax under such Section, the parties shall cooperate to amend this Agreement with the goal of giving Executive the economic benefits described herein in a manner that does not result in such tax being imposed.
 
(b)           Each payment or benefit made pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a separate payment for purposes of Code Section 409A and each payment made in installments shall be treated as a series of separate payments for purposes of Code Section 409A, to the extent permitted under applicable law.

(c)           For purposes of this Agreement, phrases such as termination of employment, when used to describe when cash severance payments may be made, shall be deemed to mean separation from service, as defined in Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.  For clarity, if Executive ceases to be an employmee but does not incur a separation from service under Code Section 409A, the Company shall calculate the amount of cash severance pay under Section 5 based on the date of Executives state law employment termination, but such cash severance pay will only be paid at such time as Executive incurs a separation from service under Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.
 
(d)           If Executive is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code and would receive any payment sooner than 6 months after Executives separation from service that, absent the application of this Section 19(d), would be subject to additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A of the Code as a result of such status as a specified employee, then such payment shall instead be payable on the date that is five (5) days following the earliest to occur of (i) 6 months after Executives separation from service, or (ii) Executives death.

(e)           All taxable reimbursements provided hereunder that are deferred compensation subjet to the requirements of Code Section 409A shall be made not later than the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred.   Any such taxable reimbursements or any taxable in-kind benefits provided in one calendar year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits to be provided in any other taxable year.

Excise Tax Provisions
 
(a)           Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of Executive (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise)  (a ) including, by example and not by way of limitation, acceleration (by the Company or otherwise) of the date of vesting or payment under any plan, program, arrangement or agreement of the Company, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999 or any interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax together with any such interest and penalties, shall be referred to as the ), then there shall be made a calculation under which such Payments provided to Executive are reduced to the extent necessary so that no portion thereof shall be subject to the Excise Tax (the ).  A comparison shall then be made between (A) Executives Net After-Tax Benefit (as defined below) assuming application of the 4999 Limit; and (B) Executives Net After-Tax Benefit without application of the 4999 Limit.  If (B) exceeds (A) by $50,000 or more, then no limit on the Payments shall be imposed by this Section 20.  Otherwise, the amount payable to Executive shall be reduced so that no such Payment is subject to the Excise Tax.   shall mean the sum of (x) all payments that Executive receives or is entitled to receive that are in the nature of compensation and contingent on a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b)(2) (either, a ), less (y) the amount of federal, state, local and employment taxes and Excise Tax (if any) imposed with respect to such payments.

(b)           In the event that a reduction in Payments is required pursuant to this Section, then, except as provided below with respect to Payments that consist of health and welfare benefits, the reduction in Payments shall be implemented by determining the Parachute Payment Ratio (as defined below) for each Payment and then reducing the Payments in order beginning with the Payment with the highest Parachute Payment Ratio.  For Payments with the same Parachute Payment Ratio, such Payments shall be reduced based on the time of payment of such Payments, with amounts being paid furthest in the future being reduced first.  For Payments with the same Parachute Payment Ratio and the same time of payment, such Payments shall be reduced on a pro-rata basis (but not below zero) prior to reducing Payments next in order for reduction.  For purposes of this Section,  shall mean a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the applicable Payment as determined for purposes of Code Section 280G, and the denominator of which is the financial present value of such Parachute Payment, determined at the date such payment is treated as made for purposes of Code Section 280G (the ).  In determining the denominator for purposes of the preceding sentence (1) present values shall be determined using the same discount rate that applies for purposes of discounting payments under Code Section 280G; (2) the financial value of payments shall be determined generally under Q&A 12, 13 and 14 of Treasury Regulation 1.280G-1; and (3) other reasonable valuation assumptions as determined by the Company shall be used.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Payments that consist of health and welfare benefits shall be reduced after all other Payments, with health and welfare Payments being made furthest in the future being reduced first.  Upon any assertion by the Internal Revenue Service that any such Payment is subject to the Excise Tax, Executive shall be obligated to return to the Company any portion of the Payment determined by the Professional Services Firm to be necessary to appropriately reduce the Payment so as to avoid any such Excise Tax.

(c)           All determinations required to be made under this Section 20, including whether and when a Payment is cut back pursuant to Section 20(a) and the amount of such cut-back, and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by a professional services firm designated by the Board that is experienced in performing calculations under Section 280G (the ) which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and Executive.  If the Professional Services Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Section 280G Transaction, the Board shall appoint another qualified professional services firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Professional Services Firm hereunder).  All fees and expenses of the Professional Services Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.

In exchange for my right to receive payments and other benefits under Section 5 of my Employment Agreement, I agree to give up all My Claims against the Employer and give up all other actions, causes of action, claims or administrative complaints that I have against the Employer.  I will not bring any lawsuits or administrative claims against the Employer relating to the claims that I have released nor will I allow any lawsuits or claims to be brought or continued on my behalf or in my name.  The money and other consideration I receive pursuant to Section 5(b) or (c) of my Employment Agreement is a full and fair payment for the release of My Claims and the Employer does not owe me anything further for My Claims.  Separate from this agreement, I will also receive the Accrued Obligations (as defined in my Employment Agreement).

I am old enough to sign this Release and to be legally bound by the agreements that I am making.  I represent that I have not filed for personal bankruptcy or been involved in any personal bankruptcy proceeding between the time any of My Claims accrued and date of my signature below.  I am legally able and entitled to receive the entire sum of money being paid to me by the Employer in settlement of My Claims.  I have not assigned or pledged any of My Claims or any portion of them to any third person.  I am a resident of the State of Colorado and have executed this Release within the State of Colorado.  I understand and agree that this Release contains all the agreements between the Employer and me relating to this settlement, and that it supersedes all prior negotiations and agreements relating to the subject matter hereof.

If I cannot make up my mind in that time, the Employer may or may not allow more time.  I acknowledge that if I sign this Release before the end of the twenty-one (21) day period, it will be my personal, voluntary decision to do so.
 
 
I understand that I may rescind (that is, cancel) this Release for any reason within seven (7) calendar days after I sign and deliver it to the Employer.

Nothing herein shall prohibit any party (1) from disclosing that I am no longer employed by the Company; (2) from responding truthfully to any governmental investigation, legal process or inquiry related thereto, (3) from making traditional competitive statements in the course of promoting a competing business (other than in violation of Sections 5 or 6 of the Employment Agreement); or (4) from making a good faith rebuttal of the other partys untrue or misleading statement.
 
 
A-3
 
 
 
Sections 6 through 15 and 17 through 23 of the Employment Agreement (but subject to Executives right to receive the payments and benefits provided under Section 5 of the Employment Agreement) shall survive the termination of my employment and are incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth.
 
 
This Release shall be deemed to have been executed and delivered within the State of Colorado, and my rights and obligations and the rights and obligations of the Employer hereunder shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and governed by, the laws of the State of Colorado without regard to principles of conflict of laws.
 
 
Any dispute or controversy arising out of interpretation or enforcement of this Release shall be resolved pursuant to the terms set forth in Section 22 of the Employment Agreement.
 
 
If any provision of this Release is declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid for any reason, such invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions.  On the contrary, such remaining provisions shall be fully severable, and this Release shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid provisions never had been inserted in the Release.

Section 409A Savings Clause
 
(a)           It is the intention of the parties that compensation or benefits payable under this Agreement not be subject to the additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A of the Code and this Agreement shall be interpreted accordingly.  To the extent such potential payments or benefits could become subject to additional tax under such Section, the parties shall cooperate to amend this Agreement with the goal of giving Executive the economic benefits described herein in a manner that does not result in such tax being imposed.
 
(b)           Each payment or benefit made pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a separate payment for purposes of Code Section 409A and each payment made in installments shall be treated as a series of separate payments for purposes of Code Section 409A, to the extent permitted under applicable law.  In addition, payments or benefits pursuant to Section 5 shall be exempt from the requirements of Code Section 409A to the maximum extent possible as short-term deferrals pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), as involuntary separation pay pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), as exempt reimbursements under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v), and/or under any other exemption that may be applicable, and this Agreement shall be construed accordingly.
 
(c)           For purposes of this Agreement, phrases such as termination of employment, when used to describe when cash severance payments may be made, shall be deemed to mean separation from service, as defined in Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.  For clarity, if Executive ceases to be an employmee but does not incur a separation from service under Code Section 409A, the Company shall calculate the amount of cash severance pay under Section 5 based on the date of Executives state law employment termination, but such cash severance pay will only be paid at such time as Executive incurs a separation from service under Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.
 
 
12
 
 
(d)           If Executive is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code and would receive any payment sooner than 6 months after Executives separation from service that, absent the application of this Section 19(d), would be subject to additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A of the Code as a result of such status as a specified employee, then such payment shall instead be payable on the date that is five (5) days following the earliest to occur of (i) 6 months after Executives separation from service, or (ii) Executives death.
 
(e)           All taxable reimbursements provided hereunder that are deferred compensation subjet to the requirements of Code Section 409A shall be made not later than the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred.   Any such taxable reimbursements or any taxable in-kind benefits provided in one calendar year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits to be provided in any other taxable year.
 
20.           .
Excise Tax Provisions
 
(a)           Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of Executive (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise)  (a ) including, by example and not by way of limitation, acceleration (by the Company or otherwise) of the date of vesting or payment under any plan, program, arrangement or agreement of the Company, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999 or any interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax together with any such interest and penalties, shall be referred to as the ), then there shall be made a calculation under which such Payments provided to Executive are reduced to the extent necessary so that no portion thereof shall be subject to the Excise Tax (the ).  A comparison shall then be made between (A) Executives Net After-Tax Benefit (as defined below) assuming application of the 4999 Limit; and (B) Executives Net After-Tax Benefit without application of the 4999 Limit.  If (B) exceeds (A) by $50,000 or more, then no limit on the Payments shall be imposed by this Section 20.  Otherwise, the amount payable to Executive shall be reduced so that no such Payment is subject to the Excise Tax.   shall mean the sum of (x) all payments that Executive receives or is entitled to receive that are in the nature of compensation and contingent on a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b)(2) (either, a ), less (y) the amount of federal, state, local and employment taxes and Excise Tax (if any) imposed with respect to such payments.

(b)           In the event that a reduction in Payments is required pursuant to this Section, then, except as provided below with respect to Payments that consist of health and welfare benefits, the reduction in Payments shall be implemented by determining the Parachute Payment Ratio (as defined below) for each Payment and then reducing the Payments in order beginning with the Payment with the highest Parachute Payment Ratio.  For Payments with the same Parachute Payment Ratio, such Payments shall be reduced based on the time of payment of such Payments, with amounts being paid furthest in the future being reduced first.  For Payments with the same Parachute Payment Ratio and the same time of payment, such Payments shall be reduced on a pro-rata basis (but not below zero) prior to reducing Payments next in order for reduction.  For purposes of this Section,  shall mean a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the applicable Payment as determined for purposes of Code Section 280G, and the denominator of which is the financial present value of such Parachute Payment, determined at the date such payment is treated as made for purposes of Code Section 280G (the ).  In determining the denominator for purposes of the preceding sentence (1) present values shall be determined using the same discount rate that applies for purposes of discounting payments under Code Section 280G; (2) the financial value of payments shall be determined generally under Q&A 12, 13 and 14 of Treasury Regulation 1.280G-1; and (3) other reasonable valuation assumptions as determined by the Company shall be used.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Payments that consist of health and welfare benefits shall be reduced after all other Payments, with health and welfare Payments being made furthest in the future being reduced first.  Upon any assertion by the Internal Revenue Service that any such Payment is subject to the Excise Tax, Executive shall be obligated to return to the Company any portion of the Payment determined by the Professional Services Firm to be necessary to appropriately reduce the Payment so as to avoid any such Excise Tax.

(c)          All determinations required to be made under this Section 20, including whether and when a Payment is cut back pursuant to Section 20(a) and the amount of such cut-back, and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by a professional services firm designated by the Board that is experienced in performing calculations under Section 280G (the ) which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and Executive.  If the Professional Services Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Section 280G Transaction, the Board shall appoint another qualified professional services firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Professional Services Firm hereunder).  All fees and expenses of the Professional Services Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.

In exchange for my right to receive payments and other benefits under Section 5 of my Employment Agreement, I agree to give up all My Claims against the Employer and give up all other actions, causes of action, claims or administrative complaints that I have against the Employer.  I will not bring any lawsuits or administrative claims against the Employer relating to the claims that I have released nor will I allow any lawsuits or claims to be brought or continued on my behalf or in my name.  The money and other consideration I receive pursuant to Section 5(b) or (c) of my Employment Agreement is a full and fair payment for the release of My Claims and the Employer does not owe me anything further for My Claims.  Separate from this agreement, I will also receive the Accrued Obligations (as defined in my Employment Agreement).  My rights to receive the other payments and benefits due under Section 5(b) or (c) of my Employment Agreement shall be effective only after receipt by the Employer of this Release, signed by me and properly notarized, and after the expiration of the seven (7) day revocation period mentioned in Section 5, below.

Even though the Employer will pay me to settle and release My Claims, the Employer does not admit that it is legally obligated to me, and the Employer denies that it is responsible or legally obligated for My Claims or that it has engaged in any improper conduct or wrongdoing against me.
 
I have read this Release carefully and understand its terms.  I am hereby being advised by the Employer to consult with an attorney prior to signing this Release.  My decision to sign or not to sign this Release is my own voluntary decision made with full knowledge that the Employer has advised me to consult with an attorney.

I represent that I have not filed for personal bankruptcy or been involved in any personal bankruptcy proceeding between the time any of My Claims accrued and date of my signature below.  I am legally able and entitled to receive the entire sum of money being paid to me by the Employer in settlement of My Claims.  I have not assigned or pledged any of My Claims or any portion of them to any third person.  I am a resident of the State of Colorado and have executed this Release within the State of Colorado.  I understand and agree that this Release contains all the agreements between the Employer and me relating to this settlement, and that it supersedes all prior negotiations and agreements relating to the subject matter hereof.
 
 
I understand that I have twenty-one (21) days from the day that I receive this Release, not counting the day upon which I receive it, to consider whether I wish to sign this Release.  If I cannot make up my mind in that time, the Employer may or may not allow more time.  I acknowledge that if I sign this Release before the end of the twenty-one (21) day period, it will be my personal, voluntary decision to do so.
 
 
I understand that I may rescind (that is, cancel) this Release for any reason within seven (7) calendar days after I sign and deliver it to the Employer.

Section 409A Savings Clause
 
(a)           It is the intention of the parties that compensation or benefits payable under this Agreement not be subject to the additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A of the Code and this Agreement shall be interpreted accordingly.  To the extent such potential payments or benefits could become subject to additional tax under such Section, the parties shall cooperate to amend this Agreement with the goal of giving Executive the economic benefits described herein in a manner that does not result in such tax being imposed.
 
(b)           Each payment or benefit made pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a separate payment for purposes of Code Section 409A and each payment made in installments shall be treated as a series of separate payments for purposes of Code Section 409A, to the extent permitted under applicable law.  In addition, payments or benefits pursuant to Section 5 shall be exempt from the requirements of Code Section 409A to the maximum extent possible as short-term deferrals pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), as involuntary separation pay pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), as exempt reimbursements under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v), and/or under any other exemption that may be applicable, and this Agreement shall be construed accordingly.
 
(c)           For purposes of this Agreement, phrases such as termination of employment, when used to describe when cash severance payments may be made, shall be deemed to mean separation from service, as defined in Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.  For clarity, if Executive ceases to be an employmee but does not incur a separation from service under Code Section 409A, the Company shall calculate the amount of cash severance pay under Section 5 based on the date of Executives state law employment termination, but such cash severance pay will only be paid at such time as Executive incurs a separation from service under Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.
 
 
12
 
 
(d)           If Executive is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code and would receive any payment sooner than 6 months after Executives separation from service that, absent the application of this Section 19(d), would be subject to additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A of the Code as a result of such status as a specified employee, then such payment shall instead be payable on the date that is five (5) days following the earliest to occur of (i) 6 months after Executives separation from service, or (ii) Executives death.
 
(e)           All taxable reimbursements provided hereunder that are deferred compensation subjet to the requirements of Code Section 409A shall be made not later than the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred.   Any such taxable reimbursements or any taxable in-kind benefits provided in one calendar year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits to be provided in any other taxable year.
 
20.           .
Excise Tax Provisions
 
(a)           Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of Executive (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise)  (a ) including, by example and not by way of limitation, acceleration (by the Company or otherwise) of the date of vesting or payment under any plan, program, arrangement or agreement of the Company, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999 or any interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax together with any such interest and penalties, shall be referred to as the ), then there shall be made a calculation under which such Payments provided to Executive are reduced to the extent necessary so that no portion thereof shall be subject to the Excise Tax (the ).  A comparison shall then be made between (A) Executives Net After-Tax Benefit (as defined below) assuming application of the 4999 Limit; and (B) Executives Net After-Tax Benefit without application of the 4999 Limit.  If (B) exceeds (A) by $50,000 or more, then no limit on the Payments shall be imposed by this Section 20.  Otherwise, the amount payable to Executive shall be reduced so that no such Payment is subject to the Excise Tax.   shall mean the sum of (x) all payments that Executive receives or is entitled to receive that are in the nature of compensation and contingent on a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b)(2) (either, a ), less (y) the amount of federal, state, local and employment taxes and Excise Tax (if any) imposed with respect to such payments.

(b)           In the event that a reduction in Payments is required pursuant to this Section, then, except as provided below with respect to Payments that consist of health and welfare benefits, the reduction in Payments shall be implemented by determining the Parachute Payment Ratio (as defined below) for each Payment and then reducing the Payments in order beginning with the Payment with the highest Parachute Payment Ratio.  For Payments with the same Parachute Payment Ratio, such Payments shall be reduced based on the time of payment of such Payments, with amounts being paid furthest in the future being reduced first.  For Payments with the same Parachute Payment Ratio and the same time of payment, such Payments shall be reduced on a pro-rata basis (but not below zero) prior to reducing Payments next in order for reduction.  For purposes of this Section,  shall mean a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the applicable Payment as determined for purposes of Code Section 280G, and the denominator of which is the financial present value of such Parachute Payment, determined at the date such payment is treated as made for purposes of Code Section 280G (the ).  In determining the denominator for purposes of the preceding sentence (1) present values shall be determined using the same discount rate that applies for purposes of discounting payments under Code Section 280G; (2) the financial value of payments shall be determined generally under Q&A 12, 13 and 14 of Treasury Regulation 1.280G-1; and (3) other reasonable valuation assumptions as determined by the Company shall be used.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Payments that consist of health and welfare benefits shall be reduced after all other Payments, with health and welfare Payments being made furthest in the future being reduced first.  Upon any assertion by the Internal Revenue Service that any such Payment is subject to the Excise Tax, Executive shall be obligated to return to the Company any portion of the Payment determined by the Professional Services Firm to be necessary to appropriately reduce the Payment so as to avoid any such Excise Tax.

(c)          All determinations required to be made under this Section 20, including whether and when a Payment is cut back pursuant to Section 20(a) and the amount of such cut-back, and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by a professional services firm designated by the Board that is experienced in performing calculations under Section 280G (the ) which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and Executive.  If the Professional Services Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Section 280G Transaction, the Board shall appoint another qualified professional services firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Professional Services Firm hereunder).  All fees and expenses of the Professional Services Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.

EXHIBIT 10.6
The following terms and conditions set forth the 2012  2014 Bonus Program established under the Air Methods Corporation Performance Pay Plan (the ).  In the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of this program and the terms and conditions of the Performance Pay Plan, the terms and conditions of the Performance Pay Plan shall control.
Performance Pay Plan
The 2012  2014 Bonus Program is designed to measure financial performance of the Company in terms of Economic Value Added or EVA (as defined below) and to provide incentive compensation solely in the event EVA is positive during the Performance Period (positive EVA being the Performance Goal for the Performance Period).  A portion of any positive EVA during the Performance Period will then be available for distribution to program Participants (the ).  Each Participants bonus compensation will be based on a percentage of the Distributable EVA, as established for the Participant in Section 3 below.  However, the bonus compensation otherwise payable to a Participant pursuant to this program is generally intended to be reduced in the discretion of the Committee to the extent necessary to avoid duplication of benefits among this program and the 2011-2014 Bonus Program established under the Performance Pay Plan (the ), and may be further reduced at the discretion of the Committee if an additional reduction is in the best interests of the stockholders of the Company.
Distributable EVA
2011-2014 Bonus Program
The Performance Period for this bonus program shall begin July 1, 2012 and shall end on June 30, 2014.
The following chart sets forth the Participants in the 2012  2014 Bonus Program and the percentage of Distributable EVA established for each Participant:
 
 
 
 
As soon as administratively practicable after the end of the Performance Period (but in no event later than September 1, 2014), the Committee shall certify in writing (which certification may be in the form of minutes of the Committee) the Bonus Amount (if any) to which each Participant is entitled as a result of the EVA for the Performance Period, which Bonus Amount shall be determined in accordance with this Section.  The Committees written certification shall detail in writing the results of each step in the bonus determination process described below.
  The Committee shall certify in writing (which certification may be in the form of minutes of the Committee) the EVA for the Performance Period.  In making its determination, the Committee shall rely on the auditedfinancial statements of the Company; provided, however, if the Companys audited financial statements are not available, the Company shall rely on the unaudited financial statements of the Company.  The Committee shall make adjustments in determining EVA to properly measure the Companys performance during the Performance Period in accordance with Section 5.1 of the Performance Pay Plan.  Any adjustments made by the Committee shall be described in the certification of the EVA calculation, as required by this Section, and the description shall include the reasoning for such adjustment.   In the event EVA for the Performance Period is not a positive number, no Bonus Amounts shall be payable pursuant to this program and no further determinations need be made by the Committee.
Step 1  Calculate EVA for the Performance Period.
 
 
After the Committee certifies the EVA for the Performance Period, the Committee shall determine the Distributable EVA for the Performance Period, which shall be equal to:
Step 2  Calculate Distributable EVA for the Performance Period.  
(x) EVA for the Performance Period by (y) three percent (3%).
multiplied
  After the Committee determines the Distributable EVA for the Performance Period, the Committee shall calculate the initial bonus amount for each Participant, which shall be equal to:
Step 3  Calculate Initial Bonus Amounts for Each Participant.
 
(x) Distributable EVA (y) the percentage set forth next to the Participants name in Section 3 hereof.
multiplied by
 
 
 
 
 
  After the Committee determines the initial bonus amount for each Participant, it shall then determine the actual Bonus Amount payable to each Participant.  The actual Bonus Amount for a Participant shall equal the initial bonus amount for such Participant any reduction in the initial bonus amount for such Participant determined by the Committee to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.  Although not required, the Committee is expected, except in extraordinary circumstances, to reduce each Participants initial bonus amount by the amount of any bonus payable to the Participant under the 2011-2014 Bonus Program that is attributable to EVA (as defined under the 2011-2014 Bonus Program) during the Performance Period.  It is further anticipated, but not required, that the Committee will reduce the initial bonus amount to which any Participant is otherwise entitled if senior management fails to adequately (i) develop non-core products, and/or (ii) build infrastructure for human resources and information technology departments.  It is anticipated that other reductions to the initial bonus amount of any Participant shall be instituted by the Committee solely in the event of extraordinary circumstances.  The Committee is not required to reduce any initial bonus amounts pursuant to this Section, and all reductions shall be determined individually on a Participant-by-Participant basis.  In no event may the reduction of any Participants initial bonus amount result in an increase to the actual Bonus Amount for any other Participant.
Step 4  Determine Final Bonus Amounts for each Participant.
minus
             The Committee shall notify each Participant in writing by September 4, 2014 of the Bonus Amount payable to the Participant under the program (if any).
5.1
Notification of Bonus Amounts.
           .  Subject to the provisions of Section 5.3, below, Bonus Amounts shall be paid to Participants in three (3) equal installments on each of September 12, 2014, January 1, 2015 and 2016 (each a  and collectively, the ); provided that the Participant remains employed by the Company and holds the same, equivalent, or more senior position as set forth in Section 2 hereof on each of the scheduled Payment Dates.

Payment Date
Payment Dates
           Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the provisions below shall apply in the event of the occurrence prior to January 1, 2016 of the Participants death, Disability, termination of employment, or upon a Change in Control:
5.3
Death, Disability, Termination of Employment; Change in Control.  
(a)             In the event the Participant voluntarily resigns from the Company or is terminated for Cause prior to January 1, 2016 and prior to any of the other events set forth in subsections (b), (c), or (d) of this Section 5.3, then:
Voluntary Resignation; Termination for Cause.
(i) if the resignation or termination for Cause occurs prior to the end of the regularly scheduled Performance Period, the Participant shall forfeit any right to receive any Bonus Amount hereunder.
 
 
 
 
(ii) if the resignation or termination for Cause occurs after the end of the regularly scheduled Performance Period but prior to a Payment Date, the Participant shall forfeit any unpaid portion of the Bonus Amount as of the date of termination.  For example, if the Participant voluntarily resigns from the Company or is terminated for Cause on June 30, 2015, the Participant would not be entitled to receive any unpaid portion of the Bonus Amount which would have otherwise been payable on January 1, 2016.
(b)           .  In the event the Participant is terminated without Cause or is demoted prior to January 1, 2016 and prior to any of the other events set forth in subsections (a), (c) or (d) of this Section 5.3, then:
Termination Without Cause; Demotion
(i)           if the termination without Cause or demotion occurs prior to the end of the regularly scheduled Performance Period, the Participant shall receive a Bonus Amount equal to the product of (x) the Bonus Amount to which the Participant would otherwise be entitled hereunder (determined in the ordinary course as of the end of the Performance Period, or, if a Change  in Control occurs prior to the end of the Performance Period, determined as of the date of the Change in Control in accordance with the methodology set forth in Section 5.3(d)(1)(A), below), (y) a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the number of days the Participant was employed during the Performance Period and (B) the denominator of which is 730.  Such amounts shall be paid on the earlier of (i) September 12, 2014, or (ii) the occurrence of a Change in Control.
multiplied by
(ii)          if the Participant is terminated without Cause or is demoted after the end of the regularly scheduled Performance Period, any portion of the Bonus Amount that has not yet been paid as of the date of termination shall become payable immediately.
(c)             In the event the Participant dies or becomes Disabled prior to January 1, 2016 and prior to any of the other events set forth in subsections (a), (b) or (d) of this Section 5.3, then:
Death; Disability.
(i) if the death or Disability occurs prior to the end of the regularly scheduled Performance Period, the Company shall treat the Performance Period as having ended (with respect to the affected Participant only) on the date of death or Disability and shall determine EVA, Distributable EVA, and the affected Participants Bonus Amount as of such date.  The Participants Bonus Amount as so calculated shall become payable immediately.
(ii) if the death or Disability occurs after the end of the regularly scheduled Performance Period, any portion of the Bonus Amount that has not yet been paid as of the date of death or Disability shall become payable immediately.
 
 
 
 
(d)             In the event of a Change in Control occurring prior to January 1, 2016 and prior to any of the other events set forth in subsections (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 5.3, then:
Change in Control.

The information contained in this report, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall information be deemed incorporated by reference in any registration statement, proxy statement, or other report filed under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, unless the Company specifically incorporates that information into those documents by reference.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(d) The following exhibit is filed as part of this report:
99.1
Press Release dated November 8, 2012.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
DENVER, Nov. 8, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Air Methods Corporation (Nasdaq:AIRM) reported results for the quarter ended September 30, 2012. Revenue increased 20% to $221.3 million from $185.2 million in the year-ago quarter. For the nine-month period, revenue increased 36% to $634.6 million, up from $467.2 million in the prior-year nine-month period. For the quarter, net income increased 50% to $27.8 million, or $2.14 per diluted share, as compared with 2011 third quarter net income of $18.5 million, or $1.44 per diluted share. Net income for the nine-month period increased 110% to $71.7 million, or $5.52 per diluted share, compared to $34.2 million, or $2.67 per diluted share, for the prior-year period. Financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 include operations associated with the Company's acquisition of OF Air Holdings and its subsidiaries (together, Omniflight) effective August 1, 2011. Accordingly, only two months of consolidated operations are reflected in the prior-year quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2011.
After-tax earnings for the current year quarter include $0.6 million net loss on disposition of assets. The current year after-tax quarterly earnings were further reduced by $0.9 million associated with the non-recurring cumulative effect of changes in expected blended state income tax rates. Prior-year after-tax earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 were reduced by approximately $1.4 million for transaction and non-recurring transition costs and employee severance expense related to the acquisition of Omniflight.
Effective September 1, 2012, the Company combined its community-based and hospital-based services divisions. This combination of the Company's two air medical services divisions was made in order to improve efficiency and coordination. Accordingly, net patient transport revenue (previously referred to as net community-based services revenue) no longer includes revenue from military base air medical services contracts. Air medical services contract revenue includes both fixed fee and hourly flight fee revenue associated with air medical service agreements with hospital and military customers. 
Third Quarter Highlights
Net patient transport revenue increased 28% to $153.1 million from $119.3 million. Net revenue per community-based transport (excluding military base services revenue) increased 14% to $10,316 compared with $9,054 in the prior-year quarter.  Total community-based patient transports increased 13% to 14,829 in the current-year quarter from 13,173 in the prior-year quarter. Community-based patient transports for bases open greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) and excluding Omniflight transports for July 2012 increased 3%, or 362 transports, as compared with the prior-year quarter. Weather cancellations for these same-base locations decreased by 172 transports compared with the prior-year quarter.  Air medical services contract revenue increased by 5% to $58.0 million from $55.4 million.
Consolidated maintenance expense for the current-year quarter increased by 27%, or $5.7 million, despite an increase in flight volume of only 5%. Excluding the impact of the fuel derivative agreements, the cost of aircraft fuel per flight hour increased 3% over the prior-year quarter. 
Revenue from our United Rotorcraft Division, excluding revenue generated from internal projects, decreased 4% to $8.4 million from $8.7 million in the prior-year quarter. Segment net income, excluding internal projects, decreased 12% to $1.7 million from $1.9 million in the prior-year quarter.
The Company also provided an update on preliminary October 2012 flight volume. Total community-based transports during October 2012 were 4,670 compared with 4,814 during October 2011, reflecting a 3% decrease. Same-Base Transports for October decreased 93 transports, or 2%, while weather cancellations for these same bases increased by 225 transports. 
Aaron Todd, Chief Executive Officer, stated, "During the third quarter of 2012, we completed our first full year of consolidated operations following the Omniflight acquisition. Our financial results have confirmed the accretive benefits of this acquisition and the realization of anticipated synergies. We are pleased to have experienced a return to Same-Base Transport growth during the third quarter, including on a weather-adjusted basis. Preliminary October 2012 flight volume also reflects growth in Same-Base Transports on a weather-adjusted basis. Our strong earnings growth during the current-year quarter has been achieved despite higher than anticipated maintenance expenditures."
The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern. Interested parties can access the call by dialing (877) 883-0656 (domestic) or (706) 643-8826 (international) or by accessing the web cast at www.airmethods.com.

Unless the Committee determines otherwise, and as set forth in the Restricted Stock Agreement, upon delivery of the Restricted Stock to the escrow agent, the Participant will have the rights of a stockholder with respect to the Restricted Shares, including the right to vote the Shares and to receive dividends or other distributions as described in Section 8.8.
Rights of Grantee
 
8.3           . Until all restrictions upon the shares of Restricted Stock awarded to a Participant have lapsed in the manner set forth in Section 8.4, the Shares shall not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by the Participant, nor pledged or otherwise hypothecated, nor will the certificates representing the Restricted Shares be delivered to the Participant.
Non-Transferability
 
 
5
 
 
8.4           . Restrictions upon shares of Restricted Stock awarded hereunder will lapse at such time or times and on such terms and conditions as the Committee may determine. The Restricted Stock Agreement evidencing the Restricted Stock Grant will set forth any such terms and conditions.
Lapse of Restrictions
 
8.5           . All shares of Restricted Stock will be forfeited and returned to the Company and all rights of the Participant with respect to such Restricted Share will terminate unless the Participant continues in the service of the Company until the expiration of a forfeiture period set forth in the Restricted Stock Agreement and satisfies any and all other conditions set forth in said Agreement. The Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine the forfeiture period (which may, but need not, lapse in installments) in any other terms or conditions applicable to any Restricted Stock Grant.
Forfeiture of Restricted Stock
 
8.6           . Notwithstanding anything in this Section VIII to the contrary, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, waive the forfeiture period and other conditions set forth in any Restricted Stock Agreement under appropriate circumstances, including, without limitation, the death, disability or retirement of the Participant or a material change in circumstances arising after the date of Grant, and subject to such terms and conditions (including, without limitation, forfeiture of a proportionate number of the Restricted Shares) as the Committee deems appropriate.
Waiver of Forfeiture
 
8.7           . Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee may modify outstanding awards of Restricted Stock or accept the surrender of outstanding Shares of Restricted Stock (to the extent that the restrictions on such Shares have not yet lapsed) and award new Restricted Stock Grants in substitution for them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no modification of an award will adversely alter or impair any rights or obligations under the Restricted Stock Agreement without the Participants consent.
Modification or Substitution
 
8.8           . At the time a grant of Restricted Stock is awarded, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, determine that the payment to the Participant of dividends, or a specified portion thereof, declared or paid on such Common Stock by the Company will be (i) deferred until the lapsing of the restrictions imposed upon such Common Stock and (ii) held by the Company for the account of Participant until such time. In the event that dividends are to be deferred, the Committee will determine whether such dividends are to be reinvested in additional Shares of Common Stock (which will be held as additional Shares of Restricted Stock) or held in cash. If deferred dividends are to be held in cash, there may be credited at the end of each year (or a portion thereof) interest on the amount of the account at the beginning of the year at a rate per annum as the Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine. Payment of deferred dividends in respect of the Shares of Restricted Stock (whether held in cash or as additional Restricted Shares) together with interest accrued thereon, if any, will be made upon the lapsing of restrictions imposed on the Shares in respect of which the deferred dividends were paid, and any dividends deferred, together with any interest accrued thereon, in any respect of any Restricted Shares, will be forfeited upon the forfeiture of such Shares of Restricted Stock.
Treatment of Dividends

8.9           . Upon the lapse of the restrictions on Shares of Restricted Stock, the Committee will cause a stock certificate to be delivered to the Participant with respect to such Shares, free of all restrictions hereunder.

IX.           .
Stock Appreciation Rights
 
9.1           . The Committee may, from time to time, grant Stock Appreciation Rights to a Participant with respect to not more than the number of shares of Common Stock which are, or may become, purchasable under any Stock Option held by the Participant. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, specify the terms and conditions of such rights, including without limitation the date or dates upon which such rights shall expire and become void and unexercisable; provided, however, that in no event shall such rights expire and become void and unexercisable later than the time when the related Stock Option is exercised, expires or terminates. Each Participant to whom Stock Appreciation Rights are granted shall be given written notice advising him of the grant of such rights and specifying the terms and conditions of the rights, which shall be subject to all the provisions of this Plan.
Grant of Stock Appreciation Rights
 
9.2           . Subject to Section 9.3, and in lieu of purchasing shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of a Stock Option held by him, a Participant may elect to exercise the Stock Appreciation Rights, if any, he has been granted and receive payment of the Redemption Value of all, or any portion, of the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Stock Option with respect to which he has been granted Stock Appreciation Rights; provided, however, that the Stock Appreciation Rights may be exercised only when the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to such Stock Option exceeds the exercise price of the Stock Option. A Participant shall exercise his Stock Appreciation Rights by delivering a written notice to the Committee specifying the number of shares with respect to which he exercises Stock Appreciation Rights and agreeing to surrender the right to purchase an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock subject to his Stock Option. If a Participant exercises Stock Appreciation Rights, payment of his Stock Appreciation Rights shall be made in accordance with Section 9.3 on or before the 74th day after the date of exercise of the Stock Appreciation Rights.
Exercise of Stock Appreciation Rights
 
9.3           . If a Participant elects to exercise Stock Appreciation Rights as provided in Section 9.2, the Committee may, in its absolute discretion, elect to pay any part or all of the Redemption Value of the shares with respect to which the Participant has exercised Stock Appreciation Rights in: (i) cash; (ii) shares of Common Stock; or (iii) any combination of cash and shares of Common Stock. The Committees election pursuant to this Section 9.3 shall be made by giving written notice to the Participant within said 74-day period, which notice shall specify the portion which the Committee elects to pay in cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination thereof. In the event any portion is to be paid in shares of Common Stock, the number of shares to be delivered shall be determined by dividing the amount which the Committee elects to pay in shares of Common Stock by the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on the date of exercise of the Stock Appreciation Rights. Any fractional share resulting from any such calculation shall be disregarded. Said shares, together with any cash payable to the Participant, shall be delivered within said 74-day period.
Form of Payment

X.            .  Nothing in this Plan shall confer upon the Participant the right to maintain its relationship with the Company or any Participating Subsidiary, whether as an Employee, Consultant or otherwise, nor shall it interfere in any way with any right of the Company, or any such Participating Subsidiary, to terminate its relationship with the Participant at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.
No Contract of Employment
 
XI.           .  A Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares of Common Stock subject to a Stock Option. Except as provided in Section 6.2, no adjustment shall be made in the number of shares of Common Stock issued to a Participant, or in any other rights of the Participant upon exercise of a Stock Option by reason of any dividend, distribution or other right granted to stockholders for which the record date is prior to the date of exercise of the Participants Stock Option.
No Rights as a Stockholder
 
XII.         .  No Equity Compensation Grants granted under this Plan, nor any other rights acquired by a Participant under this Plan, shall be assignable or transferable by a Participant, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution or, in the case of a Non-ISO, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined by the Code, Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), or the rules thereunder. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, permit an assignment or transfer of a Non-ISO by a Participant and the exercise thereof by a person other than such Participant, on such terms and conditions as the Committee in its sole discretion may determine. In the event of his death, the Stock Option, any Stock Appreciation Right, or the rights under a Restricted Stock Grant may be exercised by the Personal Representative of the Participants estate or, if no Personal Representative has been appointed, by the successor or successors in interest determined under the Participants will or under the applicable laws of descent and distribution.
Assignability
 
XIII.        .  If the Company or its stockholders enter into an agreement to dispose of all, or substantially all, of the assets or outstanding capital stock of the Company by means of a sale or liquidation, or a merger or reorganization in which the Company is not the surviving corporation, the Committee may, in its discretion, provide that rights under Equity Compensation Grants outstanding under the Plan as of the day before the consummation of such sale, liquidation, merger or reorganization, to the extent not vested or exercised, shall for all purposes under this Plan become vested and exercisable in full as of such date even though the dates of exercise or vesting established pursuant to an applicable Stock Option Agreement or Restricted Stock Agreement have not yet occurred.
Merger or Liquidation of the Company
 
XIV.        .  The Board may from time to time alter, amend, suspend or discontinue the Plan, including, where applicable, any modifications or amendments as it shall deem advisable in order that ISOs will be classified as incentive stock options under the Code, or in order to conform to any regulation or to any change in any law or regulation applicable thereto; provided, however, that no such action shall adversely affect the rights and obligations with respect to Stock Options at any time outstanding under the Plan; and provided further that no such action shall, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company, (i) increase the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be made subject to Stock Options (unless necessary to effect the adjustments required by Section 6.2), (ii) materially increase the benefits accruing to Participants under the Plan or (iii) materially modify the requirements as to eligibility for participation in the Plan.
Amendment

XV.         .  The Stock Options shall not be exercisable unless the purchase of such optioned shares is pursuant to an applicable effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or unless in the opinion of counsel to the Company, the proposed purchase of such optioned shares would be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and from the qualification requirements of any state securities law.

Stock Remittance
 
16.3          .

In the event that any Equity Compensation Grant is deemed to be deferred compensation that does not comply with the provisions of Code Section 409A, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Committee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to modify or amend such Equity Compensation Grant in its discretion with the intent of making such award comply with or be exempt from Code Section 409A.  However, in no event shall the Company, any Participating Subsidiary, the Board, the Committee, or any director or Committee member be liable to any Participant as a result of the application of Code Section 409A to any Equity Compensation Grant made hereunder.

XVII.       .  Neither the adoption of the Plan by the Board nor the submission of the Plan to stockholders of the Company for approval shall be construed as creating any limitations on the power or authority of the Board to adopt such other or additional incentive or other compensation arrangements of whatever nature as the Board may deem necessary or desirable or preclude or limit the continuation of any other plan, practice or arrangement for the payment of compensation or fringe benefits to employees, consultants and directors generally, or to any class or group of employees, consultants or directors, which the Company or any Participating Subsidiary now has lawfully put into effect, including, without limitation, any retirement, pension, savings and stock purchase plan, insurance, death and disability benefits, and executive short term incentive plans.

Air Methods Corporation Reports
Denver, CO., December 10, 2012  Air Methods Corporation (NASDAQ: AIRM), the global leader in air medical transportation, announced today that its board of directors has declared a special cash dividend of $7.00 per share (on a pre-split basis) on the Companys common stock, payable on December 28, 2012 to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 20, 2012.  The Company intends to fund the special cash dividend with available cash and additional borrowings under its senior credit facility.  The Company anticipates amending its senior credit facility by adding a new term loan facility of up to $100 million prior to payment of the cash dividend.
 
Aaron Todd, the Companys chief executive officer stated, Given our strong free-cash flows, access to low interest rate financing, and uncertainty in the tax code for 2013 and beyond, the Company believes this shareholder friendly action is appropriate.  Following this distribution, the Company will continue to enjoy strong financial flexibility, through operating cash flows and additional leverage capacity, for continued funding of potential acquisitions, buy-outs of leased aircraft, and future stock repurchases or cash dividends when deemed prudent by the board of directors.  We remain very bullish on continued growth in our existing business.

Subsequent to the filing of our Form 10-Qs for the quarterly periods ended June 30, 2012 and September 30, 2012, the Company identified inadvertent classification errors in its footnote disclosures for flight revenue, net of provision for contractual discounts but before provision for uncompensated care, between third-party payers and self-pay patients that had no impact on the Companys net trade accounts receivable, total revenue, operating income or net income for any of the periods presented.  As previously disclosed in the Companys Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2012, the Company combined two of its operating divisions on September 1, 2012 into a single segment and the government contract revenue previously reported as flight revenue earned from third-party payers was reclassified to air medical services contract revenue.
The Company intends to correct the errors in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2012.

On December 20, 2012, Air Methods Corporation (the Company) entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement with Sundance Helicopters, Inc. (Sundance), a Nevada corporation, The Eisenreich Family Trust u/a/d 7/9/90, The John A. Sullivan Trust u/a/d 4/12/2002 and The Granquist 2004 Trust u/a/d 3/26/2004,  as stockholders of Sundance, and Richard Eisenreich, John A. Sullivan and James A. Granquist, as guarantors.  Sundance is a helicopter tour operator based in Las Vegas, Nevada.  In connection with the stock purchase agreement, Air Methods entered into a definitive aircraft sale and purchase agreement with two affiliated entities of Sundance, SDH Capital Holdings LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, and Saguaro Rentals LLC, an Arizona limited liability company, pursuant to which the Company, or an affiliate of the Company, will purchase all of the aircraft owned by such entities and utilized by Sundance in its business.
The Company will acquire all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Sundance and the aircraft for an aggregate purchase price of $44 million in cash on a debt-free basis. The Company will fund the purchase price through its senior credit facility.  Of the purchase price, approximately $4.15 million will be paid into two escrows upon closing to secure post-closing indemnification obligations of the Sundance stockholders.  Amounts held in escrow for general indemnification obligations ($2.55 million) will be released on the 18-month anniversary of the closing date, subject to pending indemnification claims, if any, and amounts for certain identified tax obligations ($1.6 million) will be released following finalization of the matters covered by such indemnities.  The purchase price may also be decreased to the extent that the working capital of Sundance at closing is less than the agreed working capital target of approximately $1.34 million.
 
The parties agreed to customary representations, warranties and covenants in the purchase agreement. The stockholders of Sundance and the guarantors are prohibited for a period of five years following the consummation of the transaction from soliciting or hiring Sundance employees retained by the Company and from engaging in specified competitive activities. The purchase agreement also includes various other provisions customary for transactions of this nature.
The transaction is contingent upon certain customary closing conditions, including, without limitation, the termination of existing liens and the payoff of existing indebtedness of Sundance.  The transaction is expected to close by December 31, 2012.
The purchase agreement may be terminated at any time prior to closing by the mutual written consent of the Company and the stockholders, by the Company or the stockholders upon a material breach of the purchase agreement (subject to certain customary limitations) and by the Company or the stockholders if the transactions contemplated by the purchase agreement have not been consummated on or before December 31, 2012 (subject to certain customary limitations).
 
The Company issued a press release regarding the agreement to acquire Sundance on December 21, 2012. The press release is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

(e)
This Current Report on Form 8-K/A (this Amended Filing) of Air Methods Corporation (the Company) amends the Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company, originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 3, 2012 (the Initial Filing), solely by correcting inadvertent typographical errors in the Second Amended and Restated 2006 Equity Compensation Plan (the Second Amended and Restated Plan), filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Initial Filing.  Pursuant to the Initial Filing, the date on which the Second Amended and Restated Plan was approved by the Compensation Committee was erroneously reflected as September 26, 2012, the date on which the Second Amended and Restated Plan was approved by the Board was erroneously reflected as September 10, 2012 and the effective date of the Second Amended and Restated Plan was erroneously reflected as September 10, 2012.  The corrected Second Amended and Restated Plan filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Amended Filing, which replaces and supersedes the Second Amended and Restated Plan filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Initial Filing, corrects the dates on which the Second Amended and Restated Plan was approved by the Compensation Committee and the Board as September 10, 2012 and September 26, 2012, respectively, while correcting the effective date of the Second Amended and Restated Plan to September 26, 2012.
The description of the Second Amended and Restated Plan in this Amended Filing does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Second Amended and Restated Plan, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Amended Filing and is incorporated herein by reference.
Except as specifically described above, there are no changes or modifications to the Initial Filing.

Restricted Stock Grants

. The Committee may, from time to time, grant shares of Common Stock (Restricted Shares or Shares) to any Participant. The Committee shall establish all terms and conditions of the grant, including the number of Restricted Shares subject to the grant, the purchase price, if any to be paid by the Grantee for such shares and restrictions applicable to the Restricted Shares. The restrictions placed on the Restricted Shares may include restrictions on transfer of all or a portion of the Restricted Shares, provisions for the forfeiture of such Shares in specified circumstances, a right of the Company to repurchase the Restricted Shares and the conditions (including price) of such repurchase, and a right of first refusal in the Company to purchase the Shares before the Shares may be transferred to a third party. Each Restricted Stock Grant shall be evidenced by an agreement (Restricted Stock Agreement) between the Company and the Participant setting forth the terms of the Restricted Stock Grant.
Grants of Restricted Stock
 
8.2
 
. Shares of Common Stock that are issued as a Restricted Stock Grant shall be issued in the name of the Grantee as soon as reasonably practicable after the grant upon acceptance of the restrictions by the Grantee in a Restricted Stock Agreement. At the sole discretion of the Committee, certificates for the Restricted Stock will be deposited with an escrow agent (which may be the Company) designated by the Committee. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, and as set forth in the Restricted Stock Agreement, upon delivery of the Restricted Stock to the escrow agent, the Participant will have the rights of a stockholder with respect to the Restricted Shares, including the right to vote the Shares and to receive dividends or other distributions as described in Section 8.8.
Rights of Grantee
 
8.3
 
. Until all restrictions upon the shares of Restricted Stock awarded to a Participant have lapsed in the manner set forth in Section 8.4, the Shares shall not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by the Participant, nor pledged or otherwise hypothecated, nor will the certificates representing the Restricted Shares be delivered to the Participant.
Non-Transferability

8.4
 
. Restrictions upon shares of Restricted Stock awarded hereunder will lapse at such time or times and on such terms and conditions as the Committee may determine. The Restricted Stock Agreement evidencing the Restricted Stock Grant will set forth any such terms and conditions.
Lapse of Restrictions
 
8.5
 
. All shares of Restricted Stock will be forfeited and returned to the Company and all rights of the Participant with respect to such Restricted Share will terminate unless the Participant continues in the service of the Company until the expiration of a forfeiture period set forth in the Restricted Stock Agreement and satisfies any and all other conditions set forth in said Agreement. The Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine the forfeiture period (which may, but need not, lapse in installments) in any other terms or conditions applicable to any Restricted Stock Grant.
Forfeiture of Restricted Stock
 
8.6
 
. Notwithstanding anything in this Section VIII to the contrary, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, waive the forfeiture period and other conditions set forth in any Restricted Stock Agreement under appropriate circumstances, including, without limitation, the death, disability or retirement of the Participant or a material change in circumstances arising after the date of Grant, and subject to such terms and conditions (including, without limitation, forfeiture of a proportionate number of the Restricted Shares) as the Committee deems appropriate.
Waiver of Forfeiture
 
8.7
 
. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee may modify outstanding awards of Restricted Stock or accept the surrender of outstanding Shares of Restricted Stock (to the extent that the restrictions on such Shares have not yet lapsed) and award new Restricted Stock Grants in substitution for them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no modification of an award will adversely alter or impair any rights or obligations under the Restricted Stock Agreement without the Participants consent.
Modification or Substitution
 
8.8
 
. At the time a grant of Restricted Stock is awarded, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, determine that the payment to the Participant of dividends, or a specified portion thereof, declared or paid on such Common Stock by the Company will be (i) deferred until the lapsing of the restrictions imposed upon such Common Stock and (ii) held by the Company for the account of Participant until such time. In the event that dividends are to be deferred, the Committee will determine whether such dividends are to be reinvested in additional Shares of Common Stock (which will be held as additional Shares of Restricted Stock) or held in cash. If deferred dividends are to be held in cash, there may be credited at the end of each year (or a portion thereof) interest on the amount of the account at the beginning of the year at a rate per annum as the Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine. Payment of deferred dividends in respect of the Shares of Restricted Stock (whether held in cash or as additional Restricted Shares) together with interest accrued thereon, if any, will be made upon the lapsing of restrictions imposed on the Shares in respect of which the deferred dividends were paid, and any dividends deferred, together with any interest accrued thereon, in any respect of any Restricted Shares, will be forfeited upon the forfeiture of such Shares of Restricted Stock.
Treatment of Dividends

Stock Appreciation Rights
 
9.1
 
. The Committee may, from time to time, grant Stock Appreciation Rights to a Participant with respect to not more than the number of shares of Common Stock which are, or may become, purchasable under any Stock Option held by the Participant. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, specify the terms and conditions of such rights, including without limitation the date or dates upon which such rights shall expire and become void and unexercisable; provided, however, that in no event shall such rights expire and become void and unexercisable later than the time when the related Stock Option is exercised, expires or terminates. Each Participant to whom Stock Appreciation Rights are granted shall be given written notice advising him of the grant of such rights and specifying the terms and conditions of the rights, which shall be subject to all the provisions of this Plan.
Grant of Stock Appreciation Rights
 
9.2
 
. Subject to Section 9.3, and in lieu of purchasing shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of a Stock Option held by him, a Participant may elect to exercise the Stock Appreciation Rights, if any, he has been granted and receive payment of the Redemption Value of all, or any portion, of the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Stock Option with respect to which he has been granted Stock Appreciation Rights; provided, however, that the Stock Appreciation Rights may be exercised only when the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to such Stock Option exceeds the exercise price of the Stock Option. A Participant shall exercise his Stock Appreciation Rights by delivering a written notice to the Committee specifying the number of shares with respect to which he exercises Stock Appreciation Rights and agreeing to surrender the right to purchase an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock subject to his Stock Option. If a Participant exercises Stock Appreciation Rights, payment of his Stock Appreciation Rights shall be made in accordance with Section 9.3 on or before the 74th day after the date of exercise of the Stock Appreciation Rights.
Exercise of Stock Appreciation Rights
 
9.3
 
. If a Participant elects to exercise Stock Appreciation Rights as provided in Section 9.2, the Committee may, in its absolute discretion, elect to pay any part or all of the Redemption Value of the shares with respect to which the Participant has exercised Stock Appreciation Rights in: (i) cash; (ii) shares of Common Stock; or (iii) any combination of cash and shares of Common Stock. The Committees election pursuant to this Section 9.3 shall be made by giving written notice to the Participant within said 74-day period, which notice shall specify the portion which the Committee elects to pay in cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination thereof. In the event any portion is to be paid in shares of Common Stock, the number of shares to be delivered shall be determined by dividing the amount which the Committee elects to pay in shares of Common Stock by the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on the date of exercise of the Stock Appreciation Rights. Any fractional share resulting from any such calculation shall be disregarded. Said shares, together with any cash payable to the Participant, shall be delivered within said 74-day period.
Form of Payment

X.           
.  Nothing in this Plan shall confer upon the Participant the right to maintain its relationship with the Company or any Participating Subsidiary, whether as an Employee, Consultant or otherwise, nor shall it interfere in any way with any right of the Company, or any such Participating Subsidiary, to terminate its relationship with the Participant at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.
No Contract of Employment
 
XI.          
.  A Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares of Common Stock subject to a Stock Option. Except as provided in Section 6.2, no adjustment shall be made in the number of shares of Common Stock issued to a Participant, or in any other rights of the Participant upon exercise of a Stock Option by reason of any dividend, distribution or other right granted to stockholders for which the record date is prior to the date of exercise of the Participants Stock Option.
No Rights as a Stockholder
 
XII.         
.  No Equity Compensation Grants granted under this Plan, nor any other rights acquired by a Participant under this Plan, shall be assignable or transferable by a Participant, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution or, in the case of a Non-ISO, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined by the Code, Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), or the rules thereunder. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, permit an assignment or transfer of a Non-ISO by a Participant and the exercise thereof by a person other than such Participant, on such terms and conditions as the Committee in its sole discretion may determine. In the event of his death, the Stock Option, any Stock Appreciation Right, or the rights under a Restricted Stock Grant may be exercised by the Personal Representative of the Participants estate or, if no Personal Representative has been appointed, by the successor or successors in interest determined under the Participants will or under the applicable laws of descent and distribution.
Assignability
 
XIII.       
.  If the Company or its stockholders enter into an agreement to dispose of all, or substantially all, of the assets or outstanding capital stock of the Company by means of a sale or liquidation, or a merger or reorganization in which the Company is not the surviving corporation, the Committee may, in its discretion, provide that rights under Equity Compensation Grants outstanding under the Plan as of the day before the consummation of such sale, liquidation, merger or reorganization, to the extent not vested or exercised, shall for all purposes under this Plan become vested and exercisable in full as of such date even though the dates of exercise or vesting established pursuant to an applicable Stock Option Agreement or Restricted Stock Agreement have not yet occurred.
Merger or Liquidation of the Company
 
XIV.       
.  The Board may from time to time alter, amend, suspend or discontinue the Plan, including, where applicable, any modifications or amendments as it shall deem advisable in order that ISOs will be classified as incentive stock options under the Code, or in order to conform to any regulation or to any change in any law or regulation applicable thereto; provided, however, that no such action shall adversely affect the rights and obligations with respect to Stock Options at any time outstanding under the Plan; and provided further that no such action shall, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company, (i) increase the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be made subject to Stock Options (unless necessary to effect the adjustments required by Section 6.2), (ii) materially increase the benefits accruing to Participants under the Plan or (iii) materially modify the requirements as to eligibility for participation in the Plan.

DENVER, Feb. 28, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Air Methods Corporation (Nasdaq:AIRM), the global leader in air medical transportation, reported financial results for the year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2012.
For the year, revenue increased 29% to $850.8 million compared to $660.5 million in the prior year. Net income doubled to $93.2 million, or $2.39 per diluted share, in the current year from $46.6 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, in the prior year. Earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization, and income tax expenses (EBITDA) increased 51% to $257.4 million compared to $170.9 million in the prior year. (See the table at the end of this release for a reconciliation of EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, to GAAP.)
For the fourth quarter, revenue increased 12% to $216.2 million as compared with $193.3 million during the prior-year period. Net income increased 73% to $21.4 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, compared to net income of $12.4 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. EBITDA increased 26% to $60.0 million compared to $47.8 million in the prior-year quarter.
On August 1, 2011, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of OF Air Holdings Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Omniflight Helicopters, Inc. (together, Omniflight). The results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 included the consolidated operations of Omniflight since the date of the acquisition. Pre-tax earnings were reduced by approximately $2.3 million and $0.5 million for the year and fourth quarter, respectively, for transaction costs and employee severance expenses related to the acquisition of Omniflight. Pre-tax earnings for both prior-year periods were further reduced by $2.2 million for retrospective compensation paid to pilots associated with the negotiation of a new collective bargaining agreement.
Fourth Quarter Highlights
Net patient transport revenue increased 18% to $152.9 million from $129.8 million. Net revenue per patient transport increased 16% to $11,448 from $9,883 in the prior-year quarter. Total patient transports from community-based locations increased 2% to 13,334 from 13,128. Patient transports from community-based locations open greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) increased 34 transports, as compared with the prior-year quarter. Weather cancellations for these same-base locations increased by 479 transports compared with the prior-year quarter. Air medical services contract revenue increased by 5% to $56.1 million from $53.3 million. 
Consolidated maintenance expense for the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to the prior-year period increased by 10%, or $2.6 million, while flight volume decreased by 3%. Fuel costs increased by $0.9 million during the current-year quarter as compared to the prior-year quarter, representing a 17% increase.
Revenue from our United Rotorcraft Division, excluding revenue generated from internal projects, decreased to $5.6 million from $8.4 million in the prior-year quarter, a 34% decrease. Excluding internal projects, the division generated a net loss of $0.6 million in the current-year quarter compared to net income of $1.3 million in the prior-year quarter.
The Company also provided an update on preliminary January 2013 flight volume and net revenue per patient transport. Total community-based transports during January 2013 were 3,979 compared with 4,167 during January 2012, reflecting a 5% decrease. Same-Base Transports for January decreased 251 transports, or 6%, while weather cancellations for these same bases increased by 378 transports.  Preliminary net revenue per patient transport during January 2013 increased to $10,186 compared with $9,884 during January 2012, a 3% increase.  
Aaron Todd, Chief Executive Officer, stated, "The year 2012 represented the first full year of combined operations since our acquisition of Omniflight. While the operational strengths and efficiencies from this combination have certainly been reflected in these operating results, we also enjoyed strong growth from organic expansion activities and successful marketing of our core services. We anticipate acceleration of base expansion and hospital-based conversion activities in 2013 and look forward to continued growth within our core businesses."

Statements in this press release that are "forward-looking statements", including statements regarding the Company's preliminary January 2013 operational and financial results and anticipated base expansion and conversion activity, are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, the size, structure and growth of the Company's air medical services and United Rotorcraft Division; the collection rates for patient transports; the continuation and/or renewal of air medical service contracts; the anticipated impact from the Company's internal reorganization; weather conditions across the U.S.; development and changes in laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; increased regulation of the health care and aviation industry through legislative action and revised rules and standards; and other matters set forth in the Company's filings with the SEC.

Forward Looking Statements
This press release discusses EBITDA, which is not calculated in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The Company defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and gain or loss on disposition of assets. A table is provided in this press release to reconcile such non-GAAP financial measure to net income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. Such table below includes all information reasonably available to the Company at the date of this press release and adjustments that the Company can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include, but are not limited to, acquisitions and divestitures of businesses and goodwill and other asset impairments.
About Non-GAAP Financial Information:
To supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, management believes that this non-GAAP measure provides useful information about the Company's core operating results and thus is appropriate to enhance the overall understanding of the Company's past financial performance and its prospects for the future. Management believes the additions and subtractions from net income used to calculate EBITDA reflect the measurements that its bank creditors and third party stock analysts use in evaluating the Company. These adjustments to the Company's GAAP results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of the Company's underlying operational results and trends and performance. Management uses this non-GAAP measure to evaluate the Company's financial results. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to financial results determined in accordance with GAAP.

A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report.

99.1 Press Release dated April 18, 2013.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
DENVER, April 18, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Air Methods Corporation (Nasdaq:AIRM), the largest air medical transportation company in the world, provided preliminary results for first quarter 2013. Total community-based patient transports for the first quarter 2013 are estimated to be 11,841. Patients transported for community bases in operation greater than one year decreased an estimated 1,082 transports, or 9%, while weather cancellations for these same bases increased by an estimated 427 transports compared with the prior-year quarter.
Preliminary net revenue per community-based transport for the first quarter 2013 was $9,108, as compared with $10,072 in the prior-year quarter, a 10% decrease. This decrease was almost entirely attributed to deterioration in the percentage of privately insured patients transported, which declined from 36% to 32% of total patients transported, compared with fourth quarter of 2012.
As a result of these factors, the Company expects to report a net loss of approximately $0.14 to $0.16 per share for the first quarter of 2013, compared with net income of $0.32 per share in the prior-year quarter. The Company stated that these preliminary results are subject to final quarter-end closing and review procedures and are therefore subject to change.
Aaron Todd, CEO, stated, "Although the decrease in same-base transports was in excess of weather cancellations, we attribute the additional decrease to weather as well. When the severity of the weather is prolonged, it can also reduce requests for transports, which do not register as weather cancellations. Although recent price increases continue to be paid at historical collection percentages, the deterioration in percentage of privately insured patients more than offset the benefit from price adjustments. We remain hopeful that flight volume and payer mix will return to historical levels in future quarters once weather and other seasonal factors moderate."
Air Methods Corporation (www.airmethods.com) is the global leader in air medical transportation. The Air Medical Services Division is the largest provider of air medical transport services for hospitals and one of the largest community-based providers of air medical services. United Rotorcraft Division specializes in the design and manufacture of aeromedical and aerospace technology. The Tourism Division is comprised of Sundance Helicopters, Inc., which provides helicopter tours and charter flights, primarily focusing on Grand Canyon tours. Air Methods' fleet of owned, leased or maintained aircraft features over 400 helicopters and fixed wing aircraft.

EXHIBIT 99.1
DENVER, May 9, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Air Methods Corporation (Nasdaq:AIRM), the global leader in air medical transportation, reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 and provided an update on April 2013 flight volume. For the quarter, revenue decreased 6% to $179.2 million from $190.8 million in the prior-year quarter. Net loss for the first quarter of 2013 was $5.7 million, or $0.15 per share, compared with net income of $12.5 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2012. The current-year quarter includes the results of operations for Sundance Helicopters, Inc., a Grand Canyon tour operator (Sundance), which was acquired by the Company on December 31, 2012. Revenue and pre-tax income generated from Sundance during the first quarter of 2013 was $10.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively.  
Community-based patient transports were 11,845 during the current-year quarter, compared with 12,673 in the prior-year quarter, a 7% decrease. Patients transported for community bases in operation greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) decreased by 9%, or 1,081 transports, while weather cancellations for these same bases increased by 427 transports compared with the prior-year quarter. Requests for community-based service decreased 6% for bases open greater than one year. Net revenue per community-based transport decreased 10% from $10,072 to $9,098 in the current-year quarter due to deterioration in payer mix, partially offset by price increases.    
Maintenance expense, excluding Sundance, increased $0.5 million, or 2%, compared with the prior-year quarter, while flight hours decreased 5%. Increase in maintenance expense per flight hour is attributed to typical quarterly fluctuations associated with scheduled and unscheduled maintenance events. Excluding Sundance, fuel expense increased by $0.4 million, or 6%, compared with the prior-year quarter, while fuel expense per flight hour increased by 19%.
For the first quarter, Air Medical Services revenue decreased by 10% to $164.4 million compared with $183.6 million in the prior-year quarter. United Rotorcraft Division's external revenue decreased 39% to $4.4 million compared with $7.2 million in the prior-year quarter, while its external segment net income decreased from $2.1 million to an external segment net loss of $1.0 million in the current-year quarter. United Rotorcraft incurred $0.5 million during the current-year quarter for warranty-related expenses.   
The Company also provided an update on preliminary April 2013 flight volume. Total community-based transports decreased 7% to 4,417 during April 2013, compared with 4,745 in April 2012. April 2013 Same-Base Transports decreased by 435 transports, or 9%, as compared with April 2012. Weather cancellations during April 2013 for these same bases decreased by 8 compared with the prior-year month. 
Aaron Todd, CEO, stated, "As previously disclosed, we believe a greater severity in weather and weaker payer mix had a significant influence on our first quarter results. In addition, the lower flight volumes did not translate into lower maintenance expense, as there is often a delay in the expense benefit associated with decreased flight activity. Once weather moderates during the spring and summer months, we will be better able to isolate whether weak demand and payer mix were solely weather-related or reflect other factors."     
The Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern.
