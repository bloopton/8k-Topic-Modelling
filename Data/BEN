SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - ------------------------ 1. Nothing in this section shall be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell a security to any person in any jurisdiction where such offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. For more information on any U.S. Franklin Templeton fund, investors should request a prospectus containing more complete information, including sales charges, expenses and risks, from securities dealers or by calling Franklin Templeton Distributors, Inc. at 1-800/DIAL BEN(R) (1-800/342-5236). Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money. Franklin Templeton Distributors, Inc., One Franklin Parkway, San Mateo, CA, is the funds' principal distributor and a wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. 2. PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS. MORNINGSTAR ratings are based on Class A shares. LIPPER rankings are based on Class A shares, with the exception of those for Mutual Series, which are based on Class Z shares, which are offered to qualified investors only and have no sales charges nor Rule 12b-1 fees. All asset data is based on 05/31/02 figures. Indices are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in them. Unless otherwise noted, fund returns quoted reflect Class A shares. Performance returns, ratings and rankings for other classes may vary. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions and an investor may experience a gain or loss when they sell their shares. 3. LIPPER calculates averages by taking all the funds in a peer group and averaging their total returns for the periods indicated. LIPPER tracks 128 peer groups of long-term U.S. retail mutual funds, and the groups vary in size from 6 to 885. LIPPER total return calculations include reinvested dividends and capital gains, but do not include sales charges or expense subsidization by the manager. Results may have been different if these or other factors had been considered. 4. Source: LIPPER(R) INC., 6/30/02. Of the eligible Franklin Templeton non-money market funds tracked by LIPPER, 35, 40, 34 and 19 funds ranked in the top quartile and 24, 25, 22 and 19 funds ranked in the second quartile, for the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods, respectively, for their respective LIPPER peer groups. 5. Source: LIPPER(R) INC., 6/30/02. Franklin Templeton funds received 87 LIPPER LEADER designations for Preservation and 47 LIPPER LEADER designations for Consistent Return. LIPPER LEADER for Consistent Return ratings reflect the degree of a fund's historical success in achieving superior risk-adjusted returns, adjusted for volatility, relative to peers. LIPPER LEADER for Preservation ratings reflect the degree of a fund's historical success in avoiding periods of losses relative to other funds within the same asset class. Preservation ratings are relative, rather than absolute, measures, and funds named LIPPER LEADERS for Preservation may still experience losses periodically; those losses may by larger for equity and mixed equity funds than for fixed-income funds. Twenty percent of funds analyzed in each category are named LIPPER LEADERS. LIPPER LEADERS MEASURE PAST FUND PERFORMANCE, AND PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS. LIPPER LEADER STATUS DOES NOT NECESSARILY IMPLY THAT A FUND HAD THE BEST PERFORMANCE WITHIN ITS CATEGORY. LIPPER LEADER STATUS IS BASED ON RETURNS FOR A 3-YEAR PERIOD AND IS CALCULATED MONTHLY USING DATA AVAILABLE AT THE TIME OF THE CALCULATION; LIPPER UNDERTAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR UPDATING THE CALCULATIONS MORE FREQUENTLY THAN MONTHLY TO INCORPORATE MORE CURRENT DATA. 6. Source: LIPPER(R) INC., 6/30/02. 10 out of 11 eligible Templeton equity funds ranked in the top two LIPPER quartiles for the one-year period, 9 of 11 for the three-year period, 5 of 11 for the five-year period and 6 of 8 for the 10-year period for their respective LIPPER peer groups. Templeton Growth Fund Class A ranked 16 in a universe of 317 funds in LIPPER's "Global Funds" group for the one-year period, 18 of 211 for the three-year period, 19 of 136 for the five-year period and 5 of 27 for the 10-year period. Templeton Foreign Fund Class A ranked 55 in a universe of 784 funds in LIPPER'S "International Funds" group for the one-year period, 52 of 563 for the three-year period, 52 of 381 for the five-year period and 15 of 81 for the 10-year period.

7. Source: MORNINGSTAR (C) 6/30/02. For each fund with at least a three-year history, MORNINGSTAR calculates a Morningstar Rating(TM) based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. 8. Source: MORNINGSTAR (C) 6/30/02. Based on Class A shares, Templeton Growth Fund was rated against the following numbers of U.S. domiciled "World Stock" funds over the following time period: 241 funds in the last three years, 164 in the last five years and 33 in the last 10 years. With respect to these "World Stock" funds, the fund received a Morningstar Rating of 4 stars, 4 stars and 5 stars for the three-, five-, 10-year periods, respectively.

ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR-END RESULTS SAN MATEO, CA, OCTOBER 24, 2002 - Franklin Resources, Inc. (Franklin Templeton Investments) (NYSE: BEN) today reported net income of $68.5 million, or $0.26 per share diluted (after a pre-tax, non-cash, non-operating charge of $60.1 million relating to an unrealized loss in the company's corporate investments, or $0.17 per share diluted after tax) on revenues of $608.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2002. As announced on October 17, the results prior to recording this charge were in line with analyst expectations for the fourth fiscal quarter. Net income was $125.7 million, or $0.48 per share diluted, on revenues of $666.1 million in the preceding quarter. In the comparable quarter a year ago, net income was $83.9 million, or $0.32 per share diluted, on revenues of $603.9 million. Operating income decreased 9% this quarter over the prior quarter and increased 50% over the same quarter in the prior year. Net income for the year ended September 30, 2002 was $432.7 million, or $1.65 per share diluted, on revenues of $2,518.5 million as compared to net income of $484.7 million, or $1.91 per share diluted, on revenues of $2,354.8 million a year ago. Operating income increased 14% as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a 7% increase in revenue resulting from higher average assets under management, partially offset by a 5% increase in operating expenses. As of September 30, 2002, assets under management by the company's subsidiaries were $247.8 billion, as compared to $270.4 billion last quarter and $246.4 billion at this time last year. Simple monthly average assets under management during the current quarter were $259.0 billion compared to $274.8 billion in the preceding quarter and $261.3 billion in the same quarter a year ago. Equity assets now comprise 48% of total assets under management as compared to 53% last quarter and 51% at September 30, 2001. Fixed-income assets now comprise 35% of total assets under management, as compared to 31% last quarter and 32% at the same time last year. As of September 30, 2002 hybrid assets account for 15% of total assets under management, and remained unchanged from last quarter and the comparable quarter a year ago. Sales and reinvested dividends exceeded redemptions ("net inflows") for the eighth consecutive quarter. Complex-wide net inflows were $3.1 billion for the current quarter compared to $5.6 billion for the prior quarter and $1.8 billion for the comparable quarter a year ago.

For each fund with at least a three-year history, MORNINGSTAR calculates a MORNINGSTAR Rating(TM)based on a MORNINGSTAR Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each
category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall MORNINGSTAR Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) MORNINGSTAR Rating metrics. PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS. MORNINGSTAR Rating is for the A share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics.

For each fund with at least a three-year history, MORNINGSTAR calculates a MORNINGSTAR Rating based on a MORNINGSTAR Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall MORNINGSTAR Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and 10-year (if applicable) MORNINGSTAR Rating metrics. PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS. MORNINGSTAR Rating is for the A share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics. The following fund was rated against 664; 488; 102 foreign stock funds for the respective 3-, 5- and 10-year periods ended 12/31/02, as applicable.

The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or producing any Agreement among Underwriters, this Agreement, the Indenture, the Blue Sky and legal investment survey, closing documents (including any compilations thereof) and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 5(b) hereof, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky and legal investment survey; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; (v) the filing fees incident to, and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with, securing any required review by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. of the terms of the sale of the Securities; (vi) the cost of preparing the Securities; (vii) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any agent of the Trustee and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustee in connection with the Indenture and the Securities; and (viii) all other costs and expenses incident to the 8

The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder shall be subject, in their discretion, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company herein are, at and as of the Time of Delivery, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions: (a) The Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act and in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; if the Company has elected to rely upon Rule 462(b), the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement shall have become effective by 10:00 P.M., Washington, D.C. time, on the date of this Agreement; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to your reasonable satisfaction; (b) Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, shall have furnished to you such written opinion or opinions (a draft of each such opinion is attached as Annex II(a) hereto), dated the Time of Delivery, with respect to such matters as you may reasonably request, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters; (c) Murray L. Simpson, General Counsel of the Company, or, with respect to paragraph (v), other counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, shall have furnished to you such counsel's written opinion (a draft of which is attached as Annex II(b) hereto), dated the Time of Delivery, in form and substance satisfactory to you, to the effect that: (i) The Company has been duly incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. Each Significant Subsidiary of the Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation; and all of the issued shares of capital stock of each such Significant Subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable; all shares of capital stock of each such Significant Subsidiary (except for directors' qualifying shares) owned directly or indirectly by the Company, are owned free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims (such counsel being entitled to rely in respect of the opinion in this clause upon opinions of local counsel and in respect of matters of fact upon certificates of officers of the Company or its Significant Subsidiaries, provided that such counsel shall state that they believe that both you and they are justified in relying upon such opinions and certificates); (ii) The Company has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties or conducts any business so as to require such qualification, except where the failure of the Company to be so qualified and be in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (such 9
counsel being entitled to rely in respect of the opinion in this clause upon opinions of local counsel and in respect of matters of fact upon certificates of officers of the Company, provided that such counsel shall state that they believe that both you and they are justified in relying upon such opinions and certificates); (iii) Other than as set forth in the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, would individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect; and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others; (iv) Neither the Company nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries is in violation of its Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws or, to such counsel's best knowledge after due inquiry, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, in default in the performance or observance of any material obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, or lease or agreement or other instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound; and (v) The issuance and sale of the Securities and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture and this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not conflict with, constitute a default under or violate the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, the Gramm-Leach-Blilely Act and the Community Reinvestment Act and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and any other laws or regulations relating to the regulation of bank holding companies and financial holding companies ("Banking Laws"). (d) Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, counsel for the Company, shall have furnished to you their written opinion (a draft of such opinion is attached as Annex II(c) hereto), dated the Time of Delivery, in form and substance satisfactory to you, to the effect that: (i) The Company is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as described in the Prospectus; (ii) The Company has an authorized capitalization as set forth in the Prospectus in the column entitled "Actual" under the caption "Capitalization," and all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are duly authorized, validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable; (iii) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company; (iv) The Securities are in the form contemplated by the Indenture, have been duly authorized by the Company and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and issued and delivered against payment of the purchase price therefor (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Indenture by the Trustee), will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against it in 10
accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity) and will be entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture; (v) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee) constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity) and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the TIA; (vi) The issuance and sale of the Securities and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture and this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not conflict with, constitute a default under or violate (i) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws of the Company (ii) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any material document, agreement or other instrument to which the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is party or by which it is bound of which we are aware , (iii) New York, Delaware or federal law or regulation (other than federal and state securities or blue sky laws, as to which we express no opinion in this paragraph), or (iv) any judgment, writ, injunction, decree, order or ruling of any court or governmental authority binding on the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries of which we are aware; (vii) No consent, approval, waiver. license or authorization or other action by or filing with any New York, Delaware or U.S. Federal government authority is required in connection with the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby or the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder, except for appropriate filings and other actions required pursuant to the Act and other actions required pursuant to federal and state securities or Blue Sky laws, as to which we express no opinion in this paragraph; (viii) The statements in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of the Notes," "Description of Debt Securities," "Underwriting", "Plan of Distribution" and "ERISA Considerations", insofar as such statements constitute summaries of the legal matters, documents or proceedings referred to therein, fairly present the information called for with respect to such legal matters, documents and proceedings and fairly summarize the matters referred to therein in all material respects; (ix) The Company is not an "investment company", as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act; and the Company is not required to register as an investment adviser with the Commission under the Advisers Act; (x) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus and any further amendments and supplements thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial 11
statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; the documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; (xi) Such counsel has participated in conferences with representatives of the Company, its independent public accountants, the Underwriters and Underwriters' counsel, at which conferences the contents of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Incorporated Documents") and related matters were discussed. In the course of performing the services referred to above, no facts have come to the attention of such counsel which cause such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement, on the effective date thereof, or any further amendment thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading or that the Prospectus as of its date or any Incorporated Document, as of the date of its filing with the Commission, or as of the Time of Delivery, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In rendering the opinions set forth in paragraphs such opinions (i) through (x) above, such counsel (A) need not express any opinion with regard to the application of laws of any jurisdiction (including the Banking Laws) other than the Federal law of the United States, the laws of the State of Delaware and New York and (B) may rely, as to matters of fact, to the extent they deem proper on representations and certificates of responsible officers of the Company and certificates of public officials. (e) On the date of the Prospectus, at a time prior to the execution of this Agreement, at 9:30 A.M., New York City time, on the effective date of any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement filed subsequent to the date of this Agreement and also at the Time of Delivery, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to you a letter or letters, dated the respective dates of delivery thereof, in form and substance satisfactory to you, to the effect set forth in Annex I hereto (the executed copy of the letter delivered prior to the execution of this Agreement is attached as Annex I(a) hereto and a draft of the form of letter to be delivered on the effective date of any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement and as of each Time of Delivery is attached as Annex I(b) hereto); (f)(i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or 12
any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities being delivered at the Time of Delivery on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus; (g) On or after the date hereof, (i) the Securities shall be rated at least A2 by Moody's Investor's Service Inc. and A by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, a division of McGraw-Hill, Inc., and the Company shall have delivered to the Representatives a letter dated the Time of Delivery, from each such rating agency, or other evidence satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that the Securities have such ratings; (ii) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act; and (iii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities; (h) On or after the date hereof there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, Pacific Exchange or London Stock Exchange (each, an "Exchange"); (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on any Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either United States Federal or New York or California State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war; or (v) the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus; (i) The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(c) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses on the New York Business Day next succeeding the date of this Agreement; and (j) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to you at the Time of Delivery certificates of officers of the Company, reasonably satisfactory to you as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, and as to such other matters as you may reasonably request, and the Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished certificates as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (f) of this Section. 8. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise 13
out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein. (b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. 14
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act. 9. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such 15
Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all of the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. 11. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities not so delivered, but the Company 16

For each fund with at least a three-year history, MORNINGSTAR calculates a MORNINGSTAR Rating based on a MORNINGSTAR Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall MORNINGSTAR Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and 10-year (if applicable) MORNINGSTAR Rating metrics.

Franklin Resources, Inc. currently owns 12.66% of Darby, which managed approximately $700 million in private equity and mezzanine funds and managed and sub-advised approximately $300 million in emerging markets fixed-income products as of June 30, 2003. The transaction, which is subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, is expected to be completed no later than October 10, 2003. "We are very pleased to bring Darby Overseas Investments on board to expand our investment offerings in the alternative strategies arena and further meet the needs of our institutional and Fiduciary individual clients," said Charles B. Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer of Franklin Resources, Inc., who has served on Darby's Board of Directors since its establishment in 1994. "Darby's strong brand recognition and established track record in emerging markets private equity and mezzanine finance make it an excellent fit and solid strategic investment for our organization." Darby's chairman and founder is Nicholas F. Brady, former secretary of the US Treasury and former chairman and CEO of Dillon, Read & Co. Inc. He is especially well known in emerging markets and international finance as the architect of the "Brady Plan." Darby's chief executive officer is Richard H.

This is a combination of two outstanding firms that will provide exceptional leadership in emerging markets finance." Darby will continue to retain its distinct identity under the leadership of Mr. Brady and Mr. Frank with its team of experienced emerging markets investment managers, drawn from both the private and public sectors. Their approach is based on a rigorous investment process and active company relationships. The group's experience and strong business relationships come from years of working and living in their respective regions. As one of the initial investors in Darby, Franklin Templeton Investments has also participated in three of Darby's six emerging markets private equity and mezzanine funds. "We have had the opportunity to witness Darby's growth and disciplined approach firsthand," said Charles B. Johnson. "They have become a leading emerging markets private equity firm with a standard of excellence that we are committed to supporting." Darby CEO Richard Frank noted, "Darby will benefit from Franklin Templeton's outstanding reputation and international presence. With this support, we look forward to expansion by launching new private equity and mezzanine funds in emerging markets." Mr. Frank, a director of two Franklin Templeton Investments' funds for non-US investors added, "With their strong distribution capabilities and established presence in markets around the globe, they are uniquely positioned to support our objective of being the industry leader in emerging markets private equity and mezzanine finance." "The contributions of Darby's private equity group will complement Franklin Templeton Investments' broad global investment capabilities," said Mark Mobius, managing director of Templeton Asset Management, Ltd. His group specializes in investing in emerging markets. "By serving on Darby's Advisory Board over the last few years, I have had the opportunity to work with the firm on its investment policies and strategic direction, and believe this team has established itself as a proven leader, most notably in Latin America, with a strong presence in Asia and with plans for Central Europe as well," said Mobius.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS - ------------------------ FIN 46 In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46"). Under FIN 46, a variable interest entity ("VIE") is defined as a corporation, trust, partnership or other entity where the equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance the activities of the VIE or the equity investment holders do not have defined rights and obligations normally associated with an equity investment. FIN 46 requires consolidation of a VIE by the enterprise that has the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership, referred to as the primary beneficiary. The consolidation and disclosure provisions of FIN 46 are effective immediately for VIEs created after January 31, 2003, and, originally, for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2003 for VIEs created before February 1, 2003. However, in October 2003, the FASB issued Staff Position FIN 46-6 deferring the consolidation provisions of FIN 46 to interim or annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2003 for VIEs created before February 1, 2003. The following tables present the effect of the adoption of FIN 46 on the consolidated results of operations and financial position of Franklin Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") for VIEs created after January 31, 2003. These tables present the effect of consolidating VIEs for which the Company is the primary beneficiary and are intended to provide transparency as to the impact of the consolidation. The Company is continuing its evaluation of sponsored investment products and will adopt the consolidation provision of FIN 46 for entities created before February 1, 2003 in the quarter ending December 31, 2003 in accordance with Staff Position FIN 46-6. Six VIEs, all sponsored investment products with inception dates after January 31, 2003, have been consolidated in the Company's financial statements at September 30, 2003. As shown in Table I and II, the Company's operating revenues include net operating revenues of $93 thousand related to the results of operations of these VIEs from inception. In addition, an aggregate of $174 thousand of investment management fees, underwriting and distribution fees, and shareholder servicing fees related to these products have been eliminated on consolidation. Other income includes net realized and unrealized gains of the sponsored investment products of $1,645 thousand and $43 thousand of minority interest representing the portion of these sponsored investment products' income that the Company does not own. The net result of these entries required under FIN 46 increased net income by $1,141 thousand for the quarter and year ended September 30, 2003. Prior to the adoption of FIN 46, these sponsored investment products would have been classified as investment securities, available-for-sale, in the consolidated balance sheet, and Company's portion of the sponsored investment products' net change in value of $1,141 thousand would have been credited to other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet, until realized. As shown in Table III, the impact of consolidating these VIEs on the Company's balance sheet was to increase current assets by $10,358 thousand, current liabilities by $2,068 thousand and minority interest by $8,290 thousand. The net impact of $10,358 thousand includes an increase in current assets of $48,965 thousand representing the assets of the sponsored investment products, partially offset by a decrease of $38,607 thousand, representing the Company's carrying value of these investments prior to the adoption of FIN 46. In addition to our sponsored investment products, we expect to consolidate our headquarters campus under the requirements of FIN 46 in the period ending December 31, 2003. The Company qualifies as the primary beneficiary of the lessor trust, a special purpose entity that financed the construction of the campus. The Company estimates the impact on the consolidated balance sheet at October 1, 2003 will be to increase property and equipment, net, by approximately $159.0 million, and debt by approximately $164.9 million. The debt matures on September 30, 2004, and will be shown in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as a current liability until it is refinanced or paid. During the quarter ended September 30, 2003, under the current operating lease treatment, the Company has recognized and remitted to the special purpose entity rental payments of approximately $0.7 million included in information systems, technology and occupancy expense. As rental payments due under the lease agreement are equal to the interest charges incurred by the special purpose entity on the loan, after adopting FIN 46, rent expense will decline and interest expense will increase by the same amount. In addition, the Company will recognize a quarterly depreciation charge related to the campus of approximately $1.4 million in information systems, technology and occupancy expense. 6 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SFAS 150 In May 2003, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity" ("SFAS 150"), was issued. SFAS 150 clarifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and requires that these instruments be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position. As disclosed previously, the Company sells put options giving the purchaser the right to sell shares of its common stock to the Company at a specified price on the designated expiration dates. Prior to fiscal fourth quarter 2003, these put options were treated as equity instruments and the related premium received was recorded in stockholders' equity as capital in excess of par value. Under SFAS 150, effective July 1, 2003, these put options are presented as liabilities and measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized in investment and other income in the Company's consolidated income statements. The increase in fair value of these instruments during the quarter ended September 30, 2003 contributed approximately $5.0 million to non-operating income. At September 30, 2003, there were 1.9 million put options outstanding with various expiration dates from December 2003 through January 2004 and exercise prices ranging from $33 to $35. 7 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS - ------------------------ FIN 46 In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46"). Under FIN 46, a variable interest entity ("VIE") is defined as a corporation, trust, partnership or other entity where the equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance the activities of the VIE or the equity investment holders do not have defined rights and obligations normally associated with an equity investment. FIN 46 requires consolidation of a VIE by the enterprise that has the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership, referred to as the primary beneficiary. The consolidation and disclosure provisions of FIN 46 are effective immediately for VIEs created after January 31, 2003. Effective July 1, 2003, six of our sponsored investment products created after January 31, 2003, were consolidated in our financial statements. In December 2003, the FASB published FASB Interpretation No. 46, CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (REVISED DECEMBER 2003) (FIN46-R), clarifying FIN 46 and exempting certain entities from the provisions of FIN 46. Generally, application of FIN 46-R is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in structures commonly referred to as special-purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003, and, for other types of VIEs, for periods ending after March 15, 2004. We early adopted FIN 46-R as of December 31, 2003, and, as a result, we have recognized a cumulative effect of an accounting change, net of tax, as of this date to reflect the accumulated retained earnings of VIEs in which we became an interest holder prior to February 1, 2003. The following tables present the effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position of applying FIN 46-R. These tables present the effect of consolidating VIEs for which the Company is the primary beneficiary and are intended to provide transparency. These tables reflect the continuing activity of VIEs with inception dates after January 31, 2003, which were consolidated effective July 1, 2003, and they present the cumulative effect adjustment for sponsored investment products with an inception date prior to February 1, 2003. These products primarily include open-end funds registered in Canada and in other international locations. The cumulative effect adjustment, net of tax related to the sponsored investment products included in Table I is $8.0 million. The impact of consolidating these sponsored investment products on our balance sheet, included in the Table II presentation, is to increase current assets by $44.6 million, current liabilities by $9.7 million and minority interest by $34.9 million. In addition to consolidating certain sponsored investment products, we qualified as the primary beneficiary of a lessor trust, a special purpose entity that financed the construction of our headquarters campus. The cumulative effect adjustment, net of tax, related to this trust is a charge of $3.2 million. The impact of consolidating the lessor trust in our balance sheet at December 31, 2003, is to increase property and equipment, net, by approximately $157.6 million, and debt by approximately $164.9 million. The debt matures on September 30, 2004, and will continue to be shown in our consolidated balance sheet as a current liability until it is refinanced or paid.

PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS. MORNINGSTAR ratings are based on Class A shares. LIPPER rankings are based on Class A shares, with the exception of those for Mutual Series, which are based on Class Z shares, which are offered to qualified investors only and have no sales charges nor Rule 12b-1 fees. All asset data is based on 11/30/03 figures unless noted otherwise. Unless otherwise noted, fund returns quoted reflect Class A shares. Performance returns, ratings and rankings for other classes may vary. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions and an investor may experience a gain or loss when they sell their shares. 3. LIPPER calculates averages by taking all the funds in a peer group and averaging their total returns for the periods indicated. LIPPER tracks 129 peer groups of long-term U.S. retail mutual funds, and the groups vary in size from 4 to 1098. LIPPER total return calculations include reinvested dividends and capital gains, but do not include sales charges or expense subsidization by the manager. Results may have been different if these or other factors had been considered. 4. Source: LIPPER(R) Inc., 12/31/03.

Source: MORNINGSTAR(C) 12/31/03. For each fund with at least a three-year history, MORNINGSTAR calculates a MORNINGSTAR Rating based on a MORNINGSTAR Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom
10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall MORNINGSTAR Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and 10-year (if applicable) MORNINGSTAR Rating metrics. PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS. MORNINGSTAR Rating is for the A share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics. The following fund was rated against 613; 396; 126 Mid-Cap Growth funds for the respective 3-, 5- and 10-year periods ended 12/31/03, as applicable.

LIPPER scores for Preservation reflect funds' historical loss avoidance relative to other funds within the same asset class. Preservation ratings are relative, rather than absolute, measures, and funds named LIPPER Leaders for Preservation may still experience losses periodically; those losses may be larger for equity and mixed equity funds than for fixed-income funds. The LIPPER ratings are subject to change every month and are based on an equal-weighted average of percentile rankings for the Total Return and Preservation metrics over 3-, 5- and 10-year periods (if applicable). 20% of funds in each peer group are named LIPPER Leaders, the next 20% receive a score of 2, the middle 20% are scored 3, the next 20% are scored 4, and the lowest 20% are scored 5.

The following Mutual Series open-end funds were awarded LIPPER Leader status in Preservation: Mutual Shares, Mutual Beacon, Mutual Qualified, Mutual Discovery, Mutual European and Mutual Financial Services Funds rated among 6,996 Equity funds. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES DOES INFORMATION ABOUT LIPPER LEADERS CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION TO BUY OR SELL FUNDS, NOR DOES IT NECESSARILY IMPLY THAT A FUND NAMED AS A LIPPER LEADER HAD THE BEST PERFORMANCE WITHIN ITS CATEGORY. LIPPER LEADERS RATINGS ARE BASED ON PAST FUND PERFORMANCE, AND PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported): February 6, 2004 (February 4, 2004) FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) Delaware (State or other jurisdiction of incorporation) 1-9318 13-2670991 (Commission File Number) (IRS Employer Identification No.) One Franklin Parkway, San Mateo, California 94403 (Address of principal executive offices) (Zip Code) Registrant's telephone number, including area code: (650) 312-3000 ---------------------------------------------- (Former name or former address, if changed since last report): Not Applicable
ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS AND REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE On February 4, 2004, the Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts filed an administrative complaint against Franklin Resources, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (the "Company"), alleging a violation of the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act. The complaint arises from activity that occurred in 2001 during which time an officer of a Company subsidiary was negotiating an agreement with an investor relating to investments in a mutual fund and a hedge fund. The Company believes that the mutual fund investment at issue did not violate the fund's prospectus, and the Company is confident that no investors in the mutual fund were harmed by the investment. A communication was sent on behalf of this officer to the investor, that provided, among other things, that the investor would receive different terms than normal with respect to the hedge fund investment. This variance of the terms of the hedge fund investment was unauthorized and was rejected by management of the Company. This is the same officer who, as the Company disclosed in December 2003, had been placed on administrative leave and has subsequently left the Company. In addition, as part of ongoing investigations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California, the New York Attorney General, the California Attorney General, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts and the Florida Department of Financial Services, relating to certain practices in the mutual fund industry, including late trading, market timing and sales compensation arrangements, the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as certain current or former executives and employees of the Company, have received requests for information and/or subpoenas to testify or produce documents. The Company and its current employees are providing documents and information in response to these requests and subpoenas. In addition, the Company has responded to requests for similar kinds of information from regulatory authorities in some of the foreign countries where the Company conducts its global asset management business. The Staff of the SEC has informed the Company that it intends to recommend to the Commission that it will authorize an action against a subsidiary of the Company and two senior officers relating to the frequent trading issues that are the subject of the SEC's investigation. These issues were previously referenced as being under review by the Company in its Annual Report on Form 10-K and its public website. The Company currently is in discussions with the SEC Staff in an effort to resolve the issues raised in their investigation. Such discussions are preliminary and the Company cannot predict the likelihood of whether those discussions will result in a settlement and, if so, the terms of such settlement. The Company cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of the foregoing Massachusetts administrative proceeding or other governmental investigations, nor whether they will have a material negative financial impact on the Company. However, public trust and confidence are critical to the Company's business and any material loss of investor and/or client confidence could result in a significant decline in assets under management by the Company, which would have an adverse effect on future financial results.
SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. (Registrant) Date: February 6, 2004 /s/ Martin L. Flanagan ---------------------------- Martin L. Flanagan President and Co-Chief Executive Officer

The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

EXHIBIT 99.1 ------------ FROM: Franklin Resources, Inc. Corporate Communications: Lisa Gallegos (650) 312-3395 Investor Relations: Greta Gahl (650) 312-4091 franklintempleton.com FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE --------------------- FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC., ANNOUNCES SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT BY SUBSIDIARY WITH SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION San Mateo, CA, August 2, 2004 - Franklin Resources, Inc. (Franklin Templeton Investments) (NYSE: BEN) announced today that an agreement has been reached by its subsidiary, Franklin Advisers, Inc. (Franklin Advisers), with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that resolves the issues resulting from the SEC's investigation of market timing activity. Under the terms of an Order issued by the SEC, pursuant to which Franklin Advisers neither admits nor denies any wrongdoing, the Company has agreed to pay $50 million to be distributed to Franklin Templeton fund shareholders, of which $20 million is a civil penalty. The settlement had been accrued by the Company in its fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2004 and will not result in an additional charge to income. As previously disclosed, the Company continues to have discussions towards resolving governmental investigations concerning payments to securities dealers who sell fund shares commonly referred to as "revenue-sharing". In the Order, the SEC recognized that Franklin Templeton has generally sought to detect, discourage and prevent market timing in its funds and began to increase its efforts to control market timing in 1999. Charles B. Johnson, chairman of Franklin Resources, Inc., commented, "In the late `90s, we began implementing progressively more aggressive steps in our work to deter abusive market timing. We have always been committed to looking out for the best interests of our long-term shareholders, while, at the same time, respecting the fundamental rights of all shareholders to retain both maximum liquidity and their right to freely allocate their own assets. As part of our ongoing efforts, we have conducted a comprehensive internal review with the help of outside counsel. To date, we have not identified any instances of late trading, nor have we identified any market timing by our portfolio managers, investment analysts or officers of Franklin Resources, Inc." Key provisions of the Order include: * Enhancement and periodic review of compliance policies and procedures, and establishment of a corporate ombudsman; * Establishment of a new internal position whose responsibilities shall include compliance matters related to conflicts of interests; and * Retention of an Independent Distribution Consultant to develop a plan to distribute the $50 million to fund shareholders. "These provisions will be incorporated along with other steps we have already taken to address these issues," said Martin L. Flanagan, co-chief executive officer of Franklin Resources, Inc. "Protecting the best interests of our shareholders and clients has always been our first priority at Franklin Templeton. We are fully committed to making any necessary policy changes that will help us better serve our shareholders and clients." Greg Johnson, co-chief executive officer, added, "Our focus continues to be on consistently delivering strong investment performance and providing the highest standard of service to our investors. While this has been a very challenging time for the mutual fund industry and Franklin Templeton, we truly believe that our company and our industry will be strengthened in the long run."

MORNINGSTAR ratings and LIPPER rankings for Franklin Templeton funds are based on Class A shares, with the exception of LIPPER rankings for Mutual Series funds, which are based on Class Z shares. Class Z shares are offered to qualified investors only and have no sales charges nor Rule 12b-1 fees. Franklin Templeton funds are compared against a universe of all share classes. All Franklin Templeton Class A (Class Z) asset data is based on 8/31/04 figures unless noted otherwise. Indices are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in them. Unless otherwise noted, fund returns quoted reflect Class A shares. Performance returns, ratings and rankings for other classes may vary. 3. LIPPER calculates averages by taking all the funds and share classes in a peer group and averaging their total returns for the periods indicated. LIPPER tracks 143 peer groups of long-term U.S. retail mutual funds, and the groups vary in size from 4 to 987 funds. LIPPER total return calculations include reinvested dividends and capital gains, but do not include sales charges or expense subsidization by the manager. Results may have been different if these or other factors had been considered. 4. Source: LIPPER(R) Inc., 9/30/04.

Source: Lipper(R) Inc., 9/30/04. A Lipper Leaders distinction does not imply that a fund named as a Lipper Leader had the best performance in its category. Lipper Leaders Awards are based on Class A shares. Lipper ratings for Consistent Return reflect funds' historical risk-adjusted returns, adjusted for volatility, relative to peers. Lipper ratings for Total Return reflect funds' historical total return performance relative to peers. Lipper ratings for Preservation reflect funds' historical loss avoidance relative to other funds within the same asset class. Preservation ratings are relative, rather than absolute, measures, and funds named Lipper Leaders for Preservation may still experience losses periodically; those losses may be larger for equity and mixed equity funds than for fixed income funds. The Lipper ratings are subject to change every month and are based on an equal-weighted average of percentile ranks for the Consistent Return, Total Return and Preservation metrics over three-, five- and 10-year periods (if applicable). 20% of funds in each peer group are named Lipper Leaders, the next 20% receive a score of 2, the middle 20% are scored 3, the next 20% are scored 4, and the lowest 20% are scored 5. Bracketed information represents the number of funds in each category. N/A indicates that there were not enough funds in a category to constitute a class. Franklin Flex Cap Growth Fund, in Lipper's Multi-Cap Growth classification, received the following ratings for the 3-, 5- and 10-year periods respectively: Total Return: Lipper Leader [349], Lipper Leader [207], Lipper Leader [71]. Franklin Income Fund, in Lipper's Income classification, received the following ratings for the 3-, 5- and 10-year periods respectively: Consistent Return: Lipper Leader [110], Lipper Leader [77], Lipper Leader score of 2 [16]; Preservation (in Mixed Equity asset class): Lipper Leader [932], Lipper Leader [724], Lipper Leader [281]; Total Return: Lipper Leader [113], Lipper Leader [78], 2 [19]. Templeton Growth Fund, in Lipper's Global Large-Cap Value classification, received the following ratings for the 3-, 5- and 10-year periods respectively: Consistent Return: Lipper Leader [23], Lipper Leader [18], N/A [N/A]; Preservation (in Mixed Equity asset class): Lipper Leader [7377], Lipper Leader [5102], Lipper Leader [1643]; Total Return: Lipper Leader [23], Lipper Leader [18], N/A [N/A].

For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) THE OVERALL MORNINGSTAR RATING FOR A FUND IS DERIVED FROM A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE OF THE PERFORMANCE FIGURES ASSOCIATED WITH ITS THREE-, FIVE- AND 10-YEAR (IF APPLICABLE) MORNINGSTAR RATING METRICS. PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS. MORNINGSTAR Ratings are for the A share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics. The following fund was rated against 216; 162; 48 Conservative Allocation funds for the respective 3-, 5- and 10-year periods ended 9/30/04, as applicable. For the 3-, 5- and 10-year periods ended 9/30/04, the MORNINGSTAR ratings were: Franklin Income Fund 5, 5, 4.

A copy of the 2002 USIP was filed as Exhibit 10.68 to the Company's Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2002. A copy of the form of the RSA Agreement and Notice of Restricted Stock Award ("Notice of Award") under the 2002 USIP is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.74. Each of the foregoing is incorporated herein by reference. The following is a summary of the principal terms of the RSA Agreement and Notice of Award, which are qualified in their entirety by reference to Exhibit 10.74: RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD. The Company issues to participants, including the executive officers (the "Participant") shares of Stock as set forth in the Notice of Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Participant as owner as set forth in the RSA Agreement.

TRANSFER RESTRICTION. No Stock issued to Participant may be sold, transferred by gift, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise transferred or disposed of by Participant prior to the date on which it becomes vested. Participant is not precluded from exchanging the Stock awarded pursuant to a cash or stock tender offer, merger, reorganization or consolidation. Any securities (including stock dividends and stock splits) received with respect to shares of Stock which are not yet vested are subject to the RSA Agreement in the same manner and become fully vested at the same time as the Stock with respect to which such additional securities were issued.
VESTING. Participant's interest in the Stock awarded becomes vested and nonforfeitable in accordance with the Vesting Schedule in the Notice of Award so long as Participant maintains continuous status as an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary. If Participant ceases to maintain continuous status as an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries for any reason other than death or disability, all shares of Stock to the extent not yet vested on the date Participant ceases to be a full-time employee are forfeited by Participant. If Participant dies or in the event of termination of Participant's continuous status as an employee as a result of disability while a full-time employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, Participant's interest in all shares of Stock awarded become fully vested and nonforfeitable as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board, "disability" means that the Participant ceases to be an employee on account of permanent and total disability as a result of which the Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long term disability policy.

A copy of the form of the Stock Option Agreement and Notice of Grant are filed herewith as Exhibit 10.75. Each of the foregoing is incorporated herein by reference.

EXHIBIT 10.74 ------------- FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. 2002 UNIVERSAL STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT -------------------------------- This Restricted Stock Award Agreement (this "Agreement") is made as of the Award Date set forth in the Notice of Restricted Stock Award (the "Notice of Award") between Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") and the Participant named therein ("Participant"). WITNESSETH: WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has adopted the Franklin Resources, Inc. 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (the "2002 Plan"), authorizing the grant of common stock of the Company ("Stock") to eligible individuals in connection with the performance of services for the Company and its Subsidiaries, as defined in said 2002 Plan, which is incorporated herein by this reference (capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the meaning set forth in the 2002 Plan); WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has also adopted the Franklin Resources, Inc. Amended and Restated Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (the "AIP") to reward eligible individuals for contributions made to the Company by providing them an opportunity to receive an award based on the Company's performance during a particular fiscal year; WHEREAS, awards under the AIP may be paid in Stock pursuant to the 2002 Plan; and WHEREAS, the Company recognizes the efforts and contributions of Participant on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, as a reward for such efforts and contributions, has determined to pay the Participant an award under the AIP in Stock provided for in this Agreement, subject to certain restrictions. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 1. RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD. The Company is issuing to Participant shares of Stock as set forth in the Notice of Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Participant as owner thereof as set forth in this Agreement. Such shares are being issued in book entry form and maintained on the books of the Bank of New York, the Company's transfer agent, or any successor thereto. All shares of Stock issued hereunder shall be deemed issued to Participant as fully paid and non assessable shares, and Participant shall have all rights of a shareholder with respect thereto, including the right to vote, to receive dividends (including stock dividends), to participate in stock splits or other recapitalizations, and to exchange such shares in a merger, consolidation or other reorganization. The Company shall pay any applicable stock transfer taxes. Participant hereby acknowledges that Participant is acquiring the Stock issued hereunder for investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof, and that Participant does not intend to subdivide Participant's interest in the Stock with any other person. 2. TRANSFER RESTRICTION. (a) No Stock issued to Participant hereunder shall be sold, transferred by gift, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise transferred or disposed of by Participant prior to the date on which it becomes vested under paragraph 3. This paragraph shall not preclude the Participant from exchanging the Stock
awarded hereunder pursuant to a cash or stock tender offer, merger, reorganization or consolidation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any securities (including stock dividends and stock splits) received with respect to shares of Stock which are not yet vested under paragraph 3 shall be subject to the provisions of this Agreement in the same manner and shall become fully vested at the same time as the Stock with respect to which such additional securities were issued. (b) Participant acknowledges that, from time to time, the Company may be in a "Blackout Period" and/or subject to applicable securities laws that could subject the Participant to liability for engaging in any transaction involving the sale of the Company's shares. Participant further acknowledges and agrees that, prior to the sale of any shares acquired under this Award, it is Participant's responsibility to determine whether or not such sale of shares will subject Participant to liability under insider trading rules or other applicable securities laws. 3. VESTING. (a) Participant's interest in the Stock awarded under paragraph 1 shall become vested and nonforfeitable in accordance with the Vesting Schedule in the Notice of Award so long as Participant maintains Continuous Status as an Employee of the Company or a Subsidiary. Upon vesting, the Company shall, within thirty (30) days of such vesting, deliver to Participant the certificates evidencing the nonforfeitable shares, provided the withholding requirements of paragraph 4 have been satisfied. (b) If Participant ceases to maintain Continuous Status as an Employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason other than death or disability (as described in subparagraph (c)), all shares of Stock to the extent not yet vested under subparagraph (a) on the date Participant ceases to be a full-time employee shall be forfeited by Participant without payment of any consideration to Participant therefor. Any shares of Stock so forfeited shall be canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares, to be held for future distributions by the Company's 2002 Plan. (c) If Participant dies or in the event of termination of Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee as a result of disability (as determined by the Board in accordance with the policies of the Company) while a full-time employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Participant's interest in all shares of Stock awarded hereunder shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board, "disability" means that the Participant ceases to be an employee on account of permanent and total disability as a result of which the Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long term disability policy. 4. WITHHOLDING OF TAXES. (a) GENERAL. Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by Participant in connection with the Stock awarded, regardless of any action the Company or any of its Subsidiaries takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Stock awarded. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of the Stock awarded or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Stock. The Company and its Subsidiaries do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the award to reduce or eliminate Participant's tax liability. (b) PAYMENT OF WITHHOLDING TAXES. Prior to any event in connection with the Stock awarded (e.g., vesting) that the Company determines may result in any tax withholding obligation, whether United States federal, state, local or non-U.S., including any employment tax obligation (the "Tax Withholding
Obligation"), Participant must arrange for the satisfaction of the minimum amount of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company. (i) BY SHARE WITHHOLDING. Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, Participant authorizes the Company (in the exercise of its sole discretion) to withhold from those shares of Stock issuable to Participant the whole number of shares sufficient to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Participant acknowledges that the withheld shares may not be sufficient to satisfy Participant's minimum Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, Participant agrees to pay to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the withholding of shares described above. Share withholding will generally be used to satisfy the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation of individuals subject to the short-swing profit restrictions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. (ii) BY SALE OF SHARES. Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, Participant's acceptance of the Stock awarded constitutes Participant's instruction and authorization to the Company and any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose to sell on Participant's behalf a whole number of shares from those shares of Stock issuable to Participant as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Such shares will be sold on the day such Tax Withholding Obligation arises (e.g., a vesting date) or as soon thereafter as practicable. Participant will be responsible for all broker's fees and other costs of sale, and Participant agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale. To the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed Participant's minimum Tax Withholding Obligation, the Company agrees to pay such excess in cash to Participant. Participant acknowledges that the Company or its designee is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price, and that the proceeds of any such sale may not be sufficient to satisfy Participant's minimum Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, Participant agrees to pay to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the sale of shares described above. (iii) BY CHECK, WIRE TRANSFER OR OTHER MEANS. At any time not less than five (5) business days (or such fewer number of days as determined by the Committee or its designee) before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises (e.g., a vesting date), Participant may elect to satisfy Participant's minimum Tax Withholding Obligation by delivering to the Company an amount that the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation by (x) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (y) delivery of a certified check payable to the Company, or (z) such other means as specified from time to time by the Committee or its designee. 5. SUCCESSORS. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. Nothing contained in the Amended Plan or this Agreement shall be interpreted as imposing any liability on the Company or the Committee in favor of any Participant or any purchaser or other transferee of Stock with respect to any loss, cost or expense which such Participant or purchaser may incur in connection with, or arising out of any transaction involving any shares of Stock subject to the 2002 Plan or this Agreement. 6. INTEGRATION. The terms of the 2002 Plan and this Agreement are intended by the Company and the Participant to be the final expression of their agreement with respect to the shares of Stock and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous agreement. The Company and Participant further intend that the 2002 Plan and this Agreement shall constitute the complete and exclusive statement
of their terms and that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may be introduced in any arbitration, judicial, administrative or other legal proceeding involving the 2002 Plan or this Agreement. Accordingly, the 2002 Plan and this Agreement contain the entire understanding between the parties and supersede all prior oral, written and implied agreements, understandings, commitments and practices among the parties. 7. WAIVERS. Any failure to enforce any terms or conditions of the 2002 Plan or this Agreement by the Company or by Participant shall not be deemed a waiver of that term or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power for all or any other times. 8. SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. If any provision of the 2002 Plan or this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision thereof; and the Amended Plan and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if neither of them included such provision. 9. COMMITTEE DECISIONS CONCLUSIVE. All decisions of the Committee arising under the 2002 Plan or under this Agreement shall be conclusive. 10. MANDATORY ARBITRATION. To the extent permitted by law, any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its meaning or interpretation, shall be resolved solely by arbitration before an arbitrator selected in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The location for the arbitration shall be in the county or comparable jurisdiction of Participant's employment. Judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each party shall pay an equal share of the arbitrator's fees. All statutes of limitation which would otherwise be applicable shall apply to any arbitration proceeding under this paragraph. The provisions of this paragraph are intended by Participant and Company to be exclusive for all purposes and applicable to any and all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement. The arbitrator who hears and decides any dispute shall have jurisdiction and authority only to award compensatory damages to make whole a person or entity sustaining foreseeable economic damages, and, shall not have jurisdiction and authority to make any other award of any type, including without limitation, punitive damages, unforeseeable economic damage, damages for pain, suffering or emotional distress, or any other kind or form of damages. The remedy, if any, awarded by the arbitrator shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any dispute which is subject to arbitration under this paragraph. 11. DELAWARE LAW. The 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced according to the laws of the State of Delaware to the extent not preempted by the federal laws of the United States of America.

EXHIBIT 10.75 ------------- FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. 2002 UNIVERSAL STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT ---------------------- 1. GRANT OF OPTION. FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), hereby grants to the Optionee (the "Optionee") named in the Notice of Grant, an option (the "Option") to purchase a number of shares (the "Shares"), as set forth in the Notice of Grant, at the exercise price per share set forth in the Notice of Grant (the "Exercise Price"), subject to the terms, conditions and definitions of the 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (the "2002 Plan"), adopted by the Company, which is incorporated herein by reference. In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the 2002 Plan and the terms and conditions of this Stock Option Agreement (the "Option Agreement"), the terms and conditions of the 2002 Plan shall prevail. Unless otherwise defined herein, the terms defined in the 2002 Plan shall have the same defined meanings in this Option Agreement. If designated in the Notice of Grant as an Incentive Stock Option, this Option is intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option under Section 422 of the Code. 2. EXERCISE OF OPTION. (a) RIGHT TO EXERCISE. This Option is exercisable during its term in accordance with the Exercise Schedule set out in the Notice of Grant and the applicable provisions of the 2002 Plan and this Option Agreement. (b) METHOD OF EXERCISE. This Option is exercisable by delivery of an exercise notice, in the form provided by the Company and attached to this Agreement as Attachment 1 (the "Exercise Notice"), which shall state the election to exercise the Option, the number of Shares in respect of which the Option is being exercised (the "Exercised Shares") and the manner of exercise. The Exercise Notice shall be signed by the Optionee and shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Company. The Exercise Notice shall be accompanied by payment of the aggregate Exercise Price as to all Exercised Shares. This Option shall be deemed to be exercised upon receipt by the Company of such fully executed Exercise Notice accompanied by such aggregate Exercise Price in good funds. No Shares shall be issued pursuant to the exercise of this Option unless such issuance and exercise complies with all relevant provisions of law and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the Shares are then listed. Assuming such compliance, for income tax purposes the Exercised Shares shall be considered transferred to the Optionee on the date the Option is exercised with respect to such Exercised Shares. 3. METHOD OF PAYMENT. Payment of the aggregate Exercise Price shall be made in United States dollars by delivery of (i) cash, (ii) check, or in the sole and absolute discretion of the Company (iii) authorization for the Company to retain from the total number of Exercised Shares that number of Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the Exercise Price for the total number of Exercised Shares, or (iv) authorization for a broker designated by the Company to sell that number of Exercised Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the Exercise Price for the total number of Exercised Shares, or (v) by delivery of other shares (by delivery of certificates or attestation) which (x) either have been owned by the Optionee for more than six months on the date of surrender or
were not acquired, directly or indirectly, from the Company, and (y) have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which said Option shall be exercised. 4. RESTRICTIONS ON EXERCISE. (a) This Option may not be exercised if the issuance of such Shares upon such exercise or the method of payment of consideration for such shares would constitute a violation of any applicable United States federal or state securities or other law or regulation, including any rule under Part 207 of Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations ("Regulation G") as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board, or applicable laws of any jurisdiction pertaining to the Optionee. (b) Optionee acknowledges that, from time to time, the Company may be in a "Blackout Period" and/or subject to applicable securities laws that could subject the Optionee to liability for engaging in any transaction involving the sale of the Company's shares. Optionee further acknowledges and agrees that, prior to the sale of any shares acquired under this Award, it is Optionee's responsibility to determine whether or not such sale of shares will subject Optionee to liability under insider trading rules or other applicable securities laws. 5. TERMINATION OF RELATIONSHIP. In the event of termination of Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee, Optionee may, to the extent otherwise so entitled at the date of such termination (the "Termination Date"), exercise this Option for a period of ninety (90) days after the Termination Date (but in no event later than the Expiration Date). To the extent that Optionee was not entitled to exercise this Option at the Termination Date, or if Optionee does not exercise this Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate. 6. DISABILITY OF OPTIONEE. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5 above, in the event of termination of Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee as a result of disability (as determined by the Board in accordance with the policies of the Company), Optionee may, but only within six (6) months from the Termination Date (but in no event later than the Expiration Date), exercise the Option in full, even if the right to exercise shall not have otherwise accrued at the date of such total and permanent disability. All rights to exercise the Option shall expire and be of no further force or effect after such six month period. Unless changed by the Board, "disability" means that the Optionee ceases to be an employee on account of permanent and total disability as a result of which the Optionee shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long term disability policy applicable to the Optionee. To the extent that Optionee was not entitled to exercise the Option at the Termination Date, or if Optionee does not exercise such Option (to the extent otherwise so entitled) within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate. 7. DEATH OF OPTIONEE. In the event of the death of Optionee, the Option may be exercised in full at any time within six (6) months following the date of death (but in no event later than Expiration Date), by Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, even if the right to exercise shall not have otherwise accrued at the date of death. All rights to exercise the Option shall expire and be of no further force or effect after such six month period. 8. NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTION. This Option may not be transferred in any manner otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised during the lifetime of Optionee only by the Optionee. The terms of this Option shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and assigns of the Optionee. 9. TERM OF OPTION. This Option may be exercised only until the Expiration Date set out in the Notice of Grant, and may be exercised during such term only in accordance with the 2002 Plan and the
terms of this Option. The limitations set out in Section 2 of the 2002 Plan regarding option terms and options granted to more than ten percent (10%) shareholders shall apply to this Option. 10. TAX CONSEQUENCES. There are various tax consequences applicable upon the exercise of this stock option and the sale of stock acquired thereunder. Additionally, if this Option is an Incentive Stock Option that is first exercisable for more than $100,000 worth of Shares in any calendar year (as calculated based on fair market value at the date of grant), the portion of the Option first exercisable for greater than $100,000 worth of Shares will be treated as a nonstatutory stock option for tax purposes, notwithstanding the designation as an Incentive Stock Option on the Notice of Grant. THE OPTIONEE SHOULD CONSULT A TAX ADVISER BEFORE EXERCISING THIS OPTION OR DISPOSING OF THE SHARES. 11. ADJUSTMENTS. Exercise of the Option, as provided for above, may be made in full or in part, except that, in the event of an adjustment in the number of shares covered by this Option, as provided for in the 2002 Plan, resulting in other than a whole number of shares, then the Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a share, but shall be deemed to be for the nearest whole number of shares following standard rounding principles. Payments hereunder shall be rounded to the nearest cent following standard rounding principles. 12. WAIVERS. Any failure to enforce any terms or conditions of the 2002 Plan or this Agreement by the Company or by Optionee shall not be deemed a waiver of that term or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power for all or any other times. 13. SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. If any provision of the 2002 Plan or this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision thereof; and the 2002 Plan and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if neither of them included such provision. 14. COMMITTEE DECISIONS CONCLUSIVE. All decisions of the Committee arising under the 2002 Plan or under this Agreement shall be conclusive. 15. MANDATORY ARBITRATION. To the extent permitted by law, any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its meaning or interpretation, shall be resolved solely by arbitration before an arbitrator selected in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The location for the arbitration shall be in the county or comparable jurisdiction of Optionee's employment. Judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each party shall pay an equal share of the arbitrator's fees. All statutes of limitation which would otherwise be applicable shall apply to any arbitration proceeding under this paragraph. The provisions of this paragraph are intended by Optionee and Company to be exclusive for all purposes and applicable to any and all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement. The arbitrator who hears and decides any dispute shall have jurisdiction and authority only to award compensatory damages to make whole a person or entity sustaining foreseeable economic damages, and, shall not have jurisdiction and authority to make any other award of any type, including without limitation, punitive damages, unforeseeable economic damage, damages for pain, suffering or emotional distress, or any other kind or form of damages. The remedy, if any, awarded by the arbitrator shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any dispute which is subject to arbitration under this paragraph. 16. DELAWARE LAW. The 2002 Plan and this Option (including the Notice of Grant, the Option Agreement and any attachments hereto) shall be construed and enforced according to the laws of the State of Delaware to the extent not preempted by the federal laws of the United States of America.

Corporate Communications: Lisa Gallegos (650) 312-3395 Investor Relations: Greta Gahl (650) 312-4091 franklintempleton.com FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE --------------------- FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC., ANNOUNCES SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT BY SUBSIDIARY WITH CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE San Mateo, CA, November 17, 2004 - Franklin Resources, Inc. (Franklin Templeton Investments) (NYSE: BEN) (the "Company") announced today that Franklin Templeton Distributors, Inc. ("FTDI") reached an agreement with the California Attorney General's Office ("CAGO"), resolving the issues resulting from the CAGO's investigation concerning marketing support payments to securities dealers who sell fund shares. The Company continues to be in discussions towards resolving the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) investigation related to this matter. The investigations were previously disclosed by the Company earlier this year in SEC filings and press releases. The Company believes that the settlement of this matter is in the best interest of the Company and its fund shareholders. Under the terms of the settlement with the CAGO, FTDI neither admits nor denies allegations in the complaint and has agreed to pay $2 million as a civil penalty, $14 million to Franklin Templeton funds and $2 million to the CAGO. The CAGO settlement recognized certain voluntary measures and undertakings of the Company concerning marketing support payments to securities dealers who sell fund shares including the fact that Franklin Templeton had eliminated the practice of using brokerage commissions to recognize funds sales in November 2003. As a result of the CAGO settlement, the previously announced results for the quarter and fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 will be adjusted to include an additional charge to income of $18.5 million ($12.2 million net of tax), which is in addition to amounts accrued for ongoing governmental investigations, proceedings and actions in quarters through June 30, 2004. Franklin Resources, Inc. [NYSE:BEN], is a global investment organization operating as Franklin Templeton Investments. Franklin Templeton Investments provides global and domestic investment management solutions managed by its Franklin, Templeton, Mutual Series and Fiduciary Trust investment teams. The San Mateo, CA-based company has more than 50 years of investment experience and over $371 billion in assets under management as of October 31, 2004.

ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS - ----------------------- On November 15, 2004, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") approved restricted stock awards ("RSA") granting common stock ("Stock") of the Company under the Company's 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (the "2002 USIP") to certain of the Company's executive officers. Each of the following executive officers of the Company received the following number of shares of Stock: Murray L. Simpson, Executive Vice President and General Counsel: 2,500 shares; James R. Baio, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: 4,000 shares; Jennifer J. Bolt, Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer: 5,000 shares; Leslie M. Kratter, Senior Vice President and Assistant Secretary: 3,000 shares; Penelope S. Alexander, Vice President, Human Resources - U.S.: 3,000 shares; Holly E.

Lewis, Vice President and Treasurer: 2,500 shares; Charles R. Sims, Vice President: 3,500 shares and John M. Lusk, Vice President: 3,500 shares. The Company has entered into a Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the "RSA Agreement") with each of the executive officers listed above. Each RSA awarded to such executive officers of the Company has an effective grant date of November 15, 2004, and shall be fully vested on September 28, 2007, subject to possible acceleration of vesting upon the achievement of certain performance goals as described in the vesting schedule in the Notice of Restricted Stock Award ("Notice of Award"), and acceleration or forfeiture under certain events described in the RSA Agreement. A copy of the 2002 USIP was filed as Exhibit 10.68 to the Company's Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2002. A copy of the form of the RSA Agreement and Notice of Award under the 2002 USIP is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1. Each of the foregoing is incorporated herein by reference. The following is a summary of the principal terms of the RSA Agreement and Notice of Award, which are qualified in their entirety by reference to Exhibit 10.1: RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD. The Company issues to participants, including the executive officers (the "Participant") shares of Stock as set forth in the Notice of Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Participant as owner as set forth in the RSA Agreement. All shares of Stock issued are deemed to be issued to Participant as fully paid and non assessable shares, and Participant has all rights of a shareholder, including the right to vote, to receive dividends (including stock dividends), to participate in stock splits or other recapitalizations, and to exchange such shares in a merger, consolidation or other reorganization. TRANSFER RESTRICTION. No Stock issued to Participant may be sold, transferred by gift, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise transferred or disposed of by Participant prior to the date on which it becomes vested. Participant is not precluded from exchanging the Stock awarded pursuant to a cash or stock tender offer, merger, reorganization or consolidation. Any securities (including stock dividends and stock splits) received with respect to shares of Stock, which are not yet vested are subject to the RSA Agreement in the same manner and become fully vested at the same time as the Stock with respect to which such additional securities were issued.
VESTING. Participant's interest in the Stock awarded becomes vested and nonforfeitable in accordance with the vesting schedule in the Notice of Award so long as Participant maintains continuous status as an employee of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company. If Participant ceases to maintain continuous status as an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries for any reason other than death or disability, all shares of Stock to the extent not yet vested on the date Participant ceases to be a full-time employee are forfeited by Participant. If Participant dies or in the event of termination of Participant's continuous status as an employee as a result of disability while a full-time employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, Participant's interest in all shares of Stock awarded become fully vested and nonforfeitable as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board, "disability" means that the Participant ceases to be an employee on account of permanent and total disability as a result of which the Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long term disability policy. The Stock granted to the executive officers listed above shall vest in full on September 28, 2007 unless subject to earlier vesting. An accelerated vesting of the Stock will occur if either or both of the following performance goals (the "Performance Goals") are achieved: One-third of the number of shares of Stock granted pursuant to the award (the "First Vesting Shares") shall vest (the "2005 Fiscal Year Operating Income Goal") if Operating Income (as defined below) for the fiscal year of the Company ending September 30, 2005 (the "2005 Fiscal Year") is at least 15% greater than Operating Income for the fiscal year of the Company ended September 30, 2004 (the "2004 Fiscal Year"). This accelerated vesting, if any, will be effective on the later of December 15, 2005 or ten (10) business days after the release of the annual financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 2005 Fiscal Year (the "First Vesting Date"). If the 2005 Fiscal Year Operating Income Goal is not met by the First Vesting Date, there shall be no acceleration of the vesting of the First Vesting Shares, even if the 2005 Fiscal Year Operating Income Goal is later achieved and such Stock shall vest in accordance with their terms on September 28, 2007. One-third of the number of shares of Stock granted pursuant to the award (the "Second Vesting Shares") shall vest (the "2006 Fiscal Year Operating Income Goal") if Operating Income for the fiscal year of the Company ending September 30, 2006 (the "2006 Fiscal Year") is at least 32.25% greater than Operating Income for the 2004 Fiscal Year. This accelerated vesting, if any, will be effective on the later of December 15, 2006 or ten (10) business days after the release of the annual financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 2006 Fiscal Year (the "Second Vesting Date"). If the 2006 Fiscal Year Operating Income Goal is not met by the Second Vesting Date, there shall be no acceleration of the vesting of the Second Vesting Shares, even if the 2006 Fiscal Year Operating Income Goal is later achieved and such Stock shall vest in accordance with their terms on September 28, 2007. "Operating Income" with respect to any fiscal year is defined as total operating revenues less total operating expenses determined on a consolidated basis reported in the annual financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for such fiscal year.
RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT - --------------------- On November 15, 2004, the Compensation Committee also approved a restricted stock unit award to Ms. Donna Ikeda, Vice President, Human Resources - International. Ms. Ikeda received 3,000 Restricted Stock Units ("Units") under the 2002 USIP. The Company has entered into a Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (the "RSU Agreement") with Ms. Ikeda. Each Unit awarded to Ms. Ikeda shall be fully vested on September 28, 2007, subject to possible acceleration of vesting upon the achievement of certain performance goals as described in the vesting schedule set forth in the Notice of Restricted Stock Unit Award ("Notice of Unit Award"), and acceleration to forfeiture under certain events described in the RSU Agreement. A copy of the 2002 USIP was filed as Exhibit 10.68 to the Company's Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2002. A copy of the form of the RSU Agreement and Notice of Unit Award under the 2002 USIP is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.2. Each of the foregoing is incorporated herein by reference. The following is a summary of the principal terms of the RSU Agreement and Notice of Unit Award, which are qualified in their entirety by reference to Exhibit 10.2: RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD. The Company issues to participants, including Ms. Ikeda, Units as set forth in the Notice of Unit Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Participant as owner as set forth in the RSU Agreement. TRANSFER RESTRICTION. The Units may not be transferred in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Participant may designate a beneficiary of the Units in the event of Participant's death. The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and transferees of Participant. VESTING. The Units shall become vested in accordance with the vesting schedule in the Notice of Unit Award so long as Participant maintains continuous status as an employee of the Company or a subsidiary. If Participant ceases to maintain continuous status as an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason other than death or disability, all Units to the extent not yet vested on the date Participant ceases to be a full-time employee shall be forfeited by Participant. If Participant dies or in the event of termination of Participant's continuous status as an employee as a result of disability while a full-time employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Units awarded shall become fully vested as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board, "disability" means that Participant ceases to be an employee on account of permanent and total disability as a result of which Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long term disability policy. The Unit granted to Ms. Ikeda shall vest in full on September 28, 2007 unless subject to earlier vesting. An accelerated vesting of the Unit will occur if either or both of the Performance Goals (which are based on the same vesting schedule and terms described in connection with the RSA's described above-except that the term "Stock" will be replaced with "Units") are achieved.
CONVERSION OF UNITS AND ISSUANCE OF SHARES. Upon each vesting date, one share of Stock shall be issuable for each Unit that vests on such date, subject to the terms and provisions of the 2002 USIP and the RSU Agreement. Thereafter, the Company will transfer such Shares to Participant upon satisfaction of any required tax or other withholding obligations. Any fractional Unit remaining after the Award is fully vested shall be discarded and shall not be converted into a fractional share of Stock. RIGHT TO SHARES. Participant shall not have any right in, to or with respect to any of the shares of Stock (including any voting rights or rights with respect to dividends paid on the Common Stock) issuable under the RSU Award until the RSU Award is settled by the issuance of such shares of Stock to Participant.

EXHIBIT 10.1 ------------ FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. 2002 UNIVERSAL STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT This Restricted Stock Award Agreement (this "Agreement") is made as of the Award Date set forth in the Notice of Restricted Stock Award (the "Notice of Award") between Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") and the Participant named therein ("Participant"). WITNESSETH: WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has adopted the Franklin Resources, Inc. 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (the "2002 Plan"), authorizing the grant of common stock of the Company ("Stock") to eligible individuals in connection with the performance of services for the Company and its Subsidiaries, as defined in said 2002 Plan, which is incorporated herein by this reference (capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the meaning set forth in the 2002 Plan); and WHEREAS, the Company recognizes the efforts of Participant on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries and desires to motivate Participant in Participant's work and provide an inducement to remain in the service of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and WHEREAS, the Company has determined that it would be to the advantage and in the interest of the Company and its shareholders to award the Stock provided for in this Agreement to Participant, subject to restrictions, as a reward and an incentive for increased efforts and successful achievements; NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 1. RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD. The Company is issuing to Participant shares of Stock as set forth in the Notice of Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Participant as owner thereof as set forth in this Agreement. Such shares are being issued in book entry form and maintained on the books of the Bank of New York, the Company's transfer agent, or any successor thereto. All shares of Stock issued hereunder shall be deemed issued to Participant as fully paid and non assessable shares, and Participant shall have all rights of a shareholder with respect thereto, including the right to vote, to receive dividends (including stock dividends), to participate in stock splits or other recapitalizations, and to exchange such shares in a merger, consolidation or other reorganization. The Company shall pay any applicable stock transfer taxes. Participant hereby acknowledges that Participant is acquiring the Stock issued hereunder for investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof, and that Participant does not intend to subdivide Participant's interest in the Stock with any other person. 2. TRANSFER RESTRICTION. (a) No Stock issued to Participant hereunder shall be sold, transferred by gift, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise transferred or disposed of by Participant prior to the date on which it becomes vested under paragraph 3. This paragraph shall not preclude Participant from exchanging the Stock awarded hereunder pursuant to a cash or stock tender offer, merger, reorganization or consolidation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any securities (including stock dividends and stock splits) received with respect to shares of Stock which are not yet vested under paragraph 3 shall be subject to the provisions of
this Agreement in the same manner and shall become fully vested at the same time as the Stock with respect to which such additional securities were issued. (b) Participant acknowledges that, from time to time, the Company may be in a "Blackout Period" and/or subject to applicable securities laws that could subject the Participant to liability for engaging in any transaction involving the sale of the Company's shares. Participant further acknowledges and agrees that, prior to the sale of any shares acquired under this Award, it is Participant's responsibility to determine whether or not such sale of shares will subject Participant to liability under insider trading rules or other applicable securities laws. 3. VESTING. (a) Participant's interest in the Stock awarded under paragraph 1 shall become vested and nonforfeitable in accordance with the Vesting Schedule in the Notice of Award so long as Participant maintains Continuous Status as an Employee of the Company or a Subsidiary. Upon vesting, the Company shall, within thirty (30) days of such vesting, deliver to Participant the certificates evidencing the nonforfeitable shares, provided the withholding requirements of paragraph 4 have been satisfied. (b) If Participant ceases to maintain Continuous Status as an Employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason other than death or disability (as described in subparagraph (c)), all shares of Stock to the extent not yet vested under subparagraph (a) on the date Participant ceases to be a full-time employee shall be forfeited by Participant without payment of any consideration to Participant therefor. Any shares of Stock so forfeited shall be canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares, to be held for future distributions by the Company's 2002 Plan. (c) If Participant dies or in the event of termination of Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee as a result of disability (as determined by the Board in accordance with the policies of the Company) while a full-time employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Participant's interest in all shares of Stock awarded hereunder shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board, "disability" means that Participant ceases to be an employee on account of permanent and total disability as a result of which the Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long term disability policy. 4. WITHHOLDING OF TAXES. (a) GENERAL. Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by Participant in connection with the Stock awarded, regardless of any action the Company or any of its Subsidiaries takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Stock awarded. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of the Stock awarded or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Stock. The Company and its Subsidiaries do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the award to reduce or eliminate Participant's tax liability. (b) PAYMENT OF WITHHOLDING TAXES. Prior to any event in connection with the Stock awarded (e.g., vesting) that the Company determines may result in any tax withholding obligation, whether United States federal, state, local or non-U.S., including any employment tax obligation (the "Tax Withholding Obligation"), Participant must arrange for the satisfaction of the minimum amount of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company.
(i) BY SHARE WITHHOLDING. Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, Participant authorizes the Company (in the exercise of its sole discretion) to withhold from those shares of Stock issuable to Participant the whole number of shares sufficient to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Participant acknowledges that the withheld shares may not be sufficient to satisfy Participant's minimum Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, Participant agrees to pay to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the withholding of shares described above. Share withholding will generally be used to satisfy the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation of individuals subject to the short-swing profit restrictions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. (ii) BY SALE OF SHARES. Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, Participant's acceptance of the Stock awarded constitutes Participant's instruction and authorization to the Company and any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose to sell on Participant's behalf a whole number of shares from those shares of Stock issuable to Participant as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Such shares will be sold on the day such Tax Withholding Obligation arises (e.g., a vesting date) or as soon thereafter as practicable. Participant will be responsible for all broker's fees and other costs of sale, and Participant agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale. To the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed Participant's minimum Tax Withholding Obligation, the Company agrees to pay such excess in cash to Participant. Participant acknowledges that the Company or its designee is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price, and that the proceeds of any such sale may not be sufficient to satisfy Participant's minimum Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, Participant agrees to pay to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the sale of shares described above. (iii) BY CHECK, WIRE TRANSFER OR OTHER MEANS. At any time not less than five (5) business days (or such fewer number of days as determined by the Committee or its designee) before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises (e.g., a vesting date), Participant may elect to satisfy Participant's minimum Tax Withholding Obligation by delivering to the Company an amount that the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation by (x) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (y) delivery of a certified check payable to the Company, or (z) such other means as specified from time to time by the Committee or its designee. 5. SUCCESSORS. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. Nothing contained in the 2002 Plan or this Agreement shall be interpreted as imposing any liability on the Company or the Committee in favor of any Participant or any purchaser or other transferee of Stock with respect to any loss, cost or expense which such Participant or purchaser may incur in connection with, or arising out of any transaction involving any shares of Stock subject to the 2002 Plan or this Agreement. 6. INTEGRATION. The terms of the 2002 Plan and this Agreement are intended by the Company and Participant to be the final expression of their agreement with respect to the shares of Stock and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous agreement. The Company and Participant further intend that the 2002 Plan and this Agreement shall constitute the complete and exclusive statement of their terms and that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may be introduced in any
arbitration, judicial, administrative or other legal proceeding involving the 2002 Plan or this Agreement. Accordingly, the 2002 Plan and this Agreement contain the entire understanding between the parties and supersede all prior oral, written and implied agreements, understandings, commitments and practices among the parties. 7. WAIVERS. Any failure to enforce any terms or conditions of the 2002 Plan or this Agreement by the Company or by Participant shall not be deemed a waiver of that term or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power for all or any other times. 8. SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. If any provision of the 2002 Plan or this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision thereof; and the 2002 Plan and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if neither of them included such provision. 9. COMMITTEE DECISIONS CONCLUSIVE. All decisions of the Committee arising under the 2002 Plan or under this Agreement shall be conclusive. 10. MANDATORY ARBITRATION. To the extent permitted by law, any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its meaning or interpretation, shall be resolved solely by arbitration before an arbitrator selected in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The location for the arbitration shall be in the county or comparable jurisdiction of Participant's employment. Judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each party shall pay an equal share of the arbitrator's fees. All statutes of limitation which would otherwise be applicable shall apply to any arbitration proceeding under this paragraph. The provisions of this paragraph are intended by Participant and Company to be exclusive for all purposes and applicable to any and all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement. The arbitrator who hears and decides any dispute shall have jurisdiction and authority only to award compensatory damages to make whole a person or entity sustaining foreseeable economic damages, and, shall not have jurisdiction and authority to make any other award of any type, including without limitation, punitive damages, unforeseeable economic damage, damages for pain, suffering or emotional distress, or any other kind or form of damages. The remedy, if any, awarded by the arbitrator shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any dispute which is subject to arbitration under this paragraph. 11. DELAWARE LAW.

EXHIBIT 10.2 ------------ FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. 2002 UNIVERSAL STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT ------------------------------------- This Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (this "Agreement") is made as of the Award Date set forth in the Notice of Restricted Stock Unit Award (the "Notice of Award") between Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") and the Participant named therein ("Participant"). WITNESSETH: WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has adopted the Franklin Resources, Inc. 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (the "2002 Plan"), authorizing the grant of Restricted Stock Units ("Units") to eligible individuals in connection with the performance of services for the Company and its Subsidiaries, as defined in said 2002 Plan, which is incorporated herein by this reference (capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the meaning set forth in the 2002 Plan); and WHEREAS, the Company recognizes the efforts of Participant on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries and desires to motivate Participant in Participant's work and provide an inducement to remain in the service of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and WHEREAS, the Company has determined that it would be to the advantage and in the interest of the Company and its shareholders to award the Units provided for in this Agreement to Participant (the "Award"), subject to restrictions, as a reward and an incentive for increased efforts and successful achievements; NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 1. RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD. The Company is issuing to Participant Units as set forth in the Notice of Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Participant as owner thereof as set forth in this Agreement. 2. TRANSFER RESTRICTION. (a) The Units may not be transferred in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Participant may designate a beneficiary of the Units in the event of Participant's death on the beneficiary designation form included in the Notice of Award. The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and transferees of Participant. (b) Participant acknowledges that, from time to time, the Company may be in a "Blackout Period" and/or subject to applicable securities laws that could subject the Participant to liability for engaging in any transaction involving the sale of the Company's shares. Participant further acknowledges and agrees that, prior to the sale of any shares acquired under this Award, it is Participant's responsibility to determine whether or not such sale of shares will subject Participant to liability under insider trading rules or other applicable securities laws. 3. VESTING.
(a) The Units shall become vested in accordance with the Vesting Schedule in the Notice of Award so long as Participant maintains Continuous Status as an Employee of the Company or a Subsidiary. (b) If Participant ceases to maintain Continuous Status as an Employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason other than death or disability (as described in subparagraph (c)), all Units to the extent not yet vested under subparagraph (a) on the date Participant ceases to be a full-time employee shall be forfeited by Participant without payment of any consideration to Participant therefor. Any Units so forfeited shall be canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares, to be held for future distributions by the Company's 2002 Plan. (c) If Participant dies or in the event of termination of Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee as a result of disability (as determined by the Board in accordance with the policies of the Company) while a full-time employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Units awarded hereunder shall become fully vested as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board, "disability" means that Participant ceases to be an employee on account of permanent and total disability as a result of which Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long term disability policy. 4. CONVERSION OF UNITS AND ISSUANCE OF SHARES. Upon each vesting date, one share of Common Stock shall be issuable for each Unit that vests on such date (the "Stock"), subject to the terms and provisions of the 2002 Plan and this Agreement. Thereafter, the Company will transfer such Shares to Participant upon satisfaction of any required tax or other withholding obligations. Any fractional Unit remaining after the Award is fully vested shall be discarded and shall not be converted into a fractional share of Stock. 5. RIGHT TO SHARES. Participant shall not have any right in, to or with respect to any of the shares of Stock (including any voting rights or rights with respect to dividends paid on the Common Stock) issuable under the Award until the Award is settled by the issuance of such shares of Stock to Participant. 6. WITHHOLDING OF TAXES. (a) GENERAL. Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by Participant in connection with the Units awarded, regardless of any action the Company or any of its Subsidiaries takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Units awarded. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of the Units awarded or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Stock. The Company and its Subsidiaries do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the Award to reduce or eliminate Participant's tax liability. (b) PAYMENT OF WITHHOLDING TAXES. Prior to any event in connection with the Units awarded (e.g., vesting) that the Company determines may result in any tax withholding obligation, whether United States federal, state, local or non-U.S., including any employment tax obligation (the "Tax Withholding Obligation"), Participant must arrange for the satisfaction of the minimum amount of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company. (i) BY SHARE WITHHOLDING. Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, Participant authorizes the Company (in the exercise of its sole discretion) to withhold from those shares of Stock
issuable to Participant the whole number of shares sufficient to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Participant acknowledges that the withheld shares may not be sufficient to satisfy Participant's minimum Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, Participant agrees to pay to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the withholding of shares described above. Share withholding will generally be used to satisfy the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation of individuals subject to the short-swing profit restrictions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. (ii) BY SALE OF SHARES. Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, Participant's acceptance of the Award constitutes Participant's instruction and authorization to the Company and any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose to sell on Participant's behalf a whole number of shares from those shares of Stock issuable to Participant as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Such shares will be sold on the day such Tax Withholding Obligation arises (e.g., a vesting date) or as soon thereafter as practicable. Participant will be responsible for all broker's fees and other costs of sale, and Participant agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale. To the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed Participant's minimum Tax Withholding Obligation, the Company agrees to pay such excess in cash to Participant. Participant acknowledges that the Company or its designee is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price, and that the proceeds of any such sale may not be sufficient to satisfy Participant's minimum Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, Participant agrees to pay to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the sale of shares described above. (iii) BY CHECK, WIRE TRANSFER OR OTHER MEANS. At any time not less than five (5) business days (or such fewer number of days as determined by the Committee or its designee) before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises (e.g., a vesting date), Participant may elect to satisfy Participant's minimum Tax Withholding Obligation by delivering to the Company an amount that the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation by (x) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (y) delivery of a certified check payable to the Company, or (z) such other means as specified from time to time by the Committee or its designee. 5. SUCCESSORS. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. Nothing contained in the 2002 Plan or this Agreement shall be interpreted as imposing any liability on the Company or the Committee in favor of any Participant or any purchaser or other transferee of Stock with respect to any loss, cost or expense which such Participant or purchaser may incur in connection with, or arising out of any transaction involving any shares of Stock subject to the 2002 Plan or this Agreement. 6. INTEGRATION. The terms of the 2002 Plan and this Agreement are intended by the Company and Participant to be the final expression of their agreement with respect to the Units and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous agreement. The Company and Participant further intend that the 2002 Plan and this Agreement shall constitute the complete and exclusive statement of their terms and that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may be introduced in any arbitration, judicial, administrative or other legal proceeding involving the 2002 Plan or this Agreement. Accordingly, the 2002 Plan and this Agreement contain the entire understanding between the parties and supersede all prior oral, written and implied agreements, understandings, commitments and practices among the parties.
7. WAIVERS. Any failure to enforce any terms or conditions of the 2002 Plan or this Agreement by the Company or by Participant shall not be deemed a waiver of that term or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power for all or any other times. 8. SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. If any provision of the 2002 Plan or this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision thereof; and the 2002 Plan and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if neither of them included such provision. 9. COMMITTEE DECISIONS CONCLUSIVE. All decisions of the Committee arising under the 2002 Plan or under this Agreement shall be conclusive. 10. MANDATORY ARBITRATION. To the extent permitted by law, any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its meaning or interpretation, shall be resolved solely by arbitration before an arbitrator selected in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The location for the arbitration shall be in the county or comparable jurisdiction of Participant's employment. Judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each party shall pay an equal share of the arbitrator's fees. All statutes of limitation which would otherwise be applicable shall apply to any arbitration proceeding under this paragraph. The provisions of this paragraph are intended by Participant and Company to be exclusive for all purposes and applicable to any and all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement. The arbitrator who hears and decides any dispute shall have jurisdiction and authority only to award compensatory damages to make whole a person or entity sustaining foreseeable economic damages, and, shall not have jurisdiction and authority to make any other award of any type, including without limitation, punitive damages, unforeseeable economic damage, damages for pain, suffering or emotional distress, or any other kind or form of damages. The remedy, if any, awarded by the arbitrator shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any dispute which is subject to arbitration under this paragraph. 11. DELAWARE LAW. The 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced according to the laws of the State of Delaware to the extent not preempted by the federal laws of the United States of America.

(the "Company") approved restricted stock awards ("Award") granting common stock ("Stock") of the Company under the Company's 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (the "2002 USIP") to certain of the Company's executive officers. Each of the following executive officers of the Company received the following number of shares of Stock: Gregory E. Johnson: 15,625 shares; and Martin L. Flanagan: 15,625 shares. The Company has entered into a Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the "RSA Agreement") with each of the executive officers listed above. Each Award awarded to such executive officers of the Company has an effective grant date of December 15, 2004, and shall vest upon the achievement of certain performance goals as described in the vesting schedule in the Notice of Restricted Stock Award ("Notice of Award"), and is subject to acceleration or forfeiture under certain events described in the RSA Agreement. A copy of the 2002 USIP was filed as Exhibit 10.68 to the Company's Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2002. A copy of the form of the RSA Agreement and Notice of Award under the 2002 USIP is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1. Each of the foregoing is incorporated herein by reference. The following is a summary of the principal terms of the RSA Agreement and Notice of Award, which are qualified in their entirety by reference to Exhibit 10.1: RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD. - ----------------------- The Company issues to participants, including the executive officers (the "Participant") shares of Stock as set forth in the Notice of Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Participant as owner as set forth in the RSA Agreement. All shares of Stock issued are deemed to be issued to Participant as fully paid and non assessable shares, and Participant has all rights of a shareholder, including the right to vote, to receive dividends (including stock dividends), to participate in stock splits or other recapitalizations, and to exchange such shares in a merger, consolidation or other reorganization. TRANSFER RESTRICTION. No Stock issued to Participant may be sold, transferred by gift, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise transferred or disposed of by Participant prior to the date on which it becomes vested. Participant is not precluded from exchanging the Stock awarded pursuant to a cash or stock tender offer, merger, reorganization or consolidation. Any securities (including stock dividends and stock splits) received with respect to shares of Stock, which are not yet vested are subject to the RSA Agreement in the same manner and become fully vested at the same time as the Stock with respect to which such additional securities were issued.
VESTING. Participant's interest in the Stock awarded becomes vested and nonforfeitable in accordance with the vesting schedule in the Notice of Award so long as Participant maintains continuous status as an employee of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company. If Participant ceases to maintain continuous status as an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries for any reason other than death or disability, all shares of Stock to the extent not yet vested on the date Participant ceases to be a full-time employee are forfeited by Participant. If Participant dies or in the event of termination of Participant's continuous status as an employee as a result of disability while a full-time employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, Participant's interest in all shares of Stock awarded become fully vested and nonforfeitable as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board, "disability" means that the Participant ceases to be an employee on account of permanent and total disability as a result of which the Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long term disability policy. Subject to the Participant's continued employment with the Company and other limitations set forth in the Notice of Award, the RSA Agreement and the 2002 USIP, the Stock granted to the executive officers listed above shall vest in accordance with the following schedule: ONE-THIRD VESTING - ----------------- 5,209 Shares granted under the Award (the "First-Third Vesting Shares") shall vest with respect to the first fiscal year of the Company that occurs on or before the fiscal year ending on September 30, 2007 (the "2007 Fiscal Year") in which pre-tax operating income for such fiscal year is at least 15% greater than pre-tax operating income for the fiscal year of the Company ended on September 30, 2004 (the "2004 Fiscal Year"). TWO-THIRDS VESTING - ------------------ 5,208 Shares granted under the Award (the "Second-Third Vesting Shares") shall vest with respect to the first fiscal year of the Company that occurs on or before the 2007 Fiscal Year in which pre-tax operating income for such fiscal year is at least 32.25% greater than pre-tax operating income for the 2004 Fiscal Year. In the event the First-Third Vesting Shares have not previously vested, then a total of 10,417 Shares (consisting of the First-Third Vesting Shares and the Second-Third Vesting Shares) shall vest with respect to the first fiscal year of the Company that occurs on or before the 2007 Fiscal Year in which pre-tax operating income for such fiscal year is at least 32.25% greater than pre-tax operating income for the 2004 Fiscal Year. 100% VESTING - ------------ The remaining 5,208 shares granted under the Award (the "Final-Third Vesting Shares") plus the First-Third Vesting Shares and the Second-Third Vesting Shares (if not already vested) shall vest upon the first fiscal year of the Company that occurs on or before the 2007 Fiscal Year in which pre-tax operating income for such fiscal year is at least 52.09% greater than pre-tax operating income for the 2004 Fiscal Year.
FORFEITURE - ---------- If by the 2007 Fiscal Year, pre-tax operating income for any fiscal year between the 2004 Fiscal Year and the 2007 Fiscal Year has not been at least 15% greater than pre-tax operating income for the 2004 Fiscal Year, all of the Shares granted under the Award shall be forfeited back to the Company and none of the Shares shall vest. If by the 2007 Fiscal Year, pre-tax operating income for any fiscal year between the 2004 Fiscal Year and the 2007 Fiscal Year has been greater than 15% but has not been at least 32.25% greater than pre-tax operating income for the 2004 Fiscal Year, then the Second-Third Vesting Shares and the Final Third Vesting Shares shall be forfeited back to the Company. If by the 2007 Fiscal Year, pre-tax operating income for any fiscal year of the Company between the 2004 Fiscal Year and the 2007 Fiscal Year is not at least 52.09% greater than pre-tax operating income for the 2004 Fiscal Year, the Final-Third Vesting Shares shall be forfeited back to the Company. TIME OF VESTING/FORFEITURE - -------------------------- The vesting, if any, of the Shares granted under the Award as a result of the achievement of the foregoing performance criteria will be effective on the later of (i) the December 15 that follows the end of the fiscal year during which the performance goal is achieved or (ii) ten (10) business days after the release of the annual financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for such fiscal year. The forfeiture of all or any of the Shares granted pursuant to this Award as a result of the failure to achieve any or all of the foregoing performance criteria will be effective on December 15, 2007 or ten (10) business days after the release of the annual financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 2007 Fiscal Year. DEFINITION OF PRE-TAX OPERATING INCOME - -------------------------------------- "Pre-tax operating income" with respect to any fiscal year is defined as total operating revenue less total operating expenses determined on a consolidated basis reported in the annual financial statements as "Operating Income" included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for such fiscal year.

EXHIBIT INDEX EXHIBIT NO. DESCRIPTION ----------- ----------- 10.1 Form of Restricted Stock Award Agreement and Notice of Restricted Stock Award under the Company's 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan

EXHIBIT 10.1 FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. 2002 UNIVERSAL STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT This Restricted Stock Award Agreement (this "Agreement") is made as of the Award Date set forth in the Notice of Restricted Stock Award (the "Notice of Award") between Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") and the Participant named therein ("Participant"). WITNESSETH: WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has adopted the Franklin Resources, Inc. 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (the "2002 Plan"), authorizing the grant of common stock of the Company ("Stock") to eligible individuals in connection with the performance of services for the Company and its Subsidiaries, as defined in said 2002 Plan, which is incorporated herein by this reference (capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the meaning set forth in the 2002 Plan); and WHEREAS, the Company recognizes the efforts of Participant on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries and desires to motivate Participant in Participant's work and provide an inducement to remain in the service of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and WHEREAS, the Company has determined that it would be to the advantage and in the interest of the Company and its shareholders to award the Stock provided for in this Agreement to Participant, subject to restrictions, as a reward and an incentive for increased efforts and successful achievements; NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 1. RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD. The Company is issuing to Participant shares of Stock as set forth in the Notice of Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Participant as owner thereof as set forth in this Agreement. Such shares are being issued in book entry form and maintained on the books of the Bank of New York, the Company's transfer agent, or any successor thereto. All shares of Stock issued hereunder shall be deemed issued to Participant as fully paid and non assessable shares, and Participant shall have all rights of a shareholder with respect thereto, including the right to vote, to receive dividends (including stock dividends), to participate in stock splits or other recapitalizations, and to exchange such shares in a merger, consolidation or other reorganization. The Company shall pay any applicable stock transfer taxes. Participant hereby acknowledges that Participant is acquiring the Stock issued hereunder for investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof, and that Participant does not intend to subdivide Participant's interest in the Stock with any other person.
2. TRANSFER RESTRICTION. (a) No Stock issued to Participant hereunder shall be sold, transferred by gift, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise transferred or disposed of by Participant prior to the date on which it becomes vested under paragraph 3. This paragraph shall not preclude Participant from exchanging the Stock awarded hereunder pursuant to a cash or stock tender offer, merger, reorganization or consolidation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any securities (including stock dividends and stock splits) received with respect to shares of Stock which are not yet vested under paragraph 3 shall be subject to the provisions of this Agreement in the same manner and shall become fully vested at the same time as the Stock with respect to which such additional securities were issued. (b) Participant acknowledges that, from time to time, the Company may be in a "Blackout Period" and/or subject to applicable securities laws that could subject the Participant to liability for engaging in any transaction involving the sale of the Company's shares. Participant further acknowledges and agrees that, prior to the sale of any shares acquired under this Award, it is Participant's responsibility to determine whether or not such sale of shares will subject Participant to liability under insider trading rules or other applicable securities laws. 3. VESTING. (a) Participant's interest in the Stock awarded under paragraph 1 shall become vested and nonforfeitable in accordance with the Vesting Schedule in the Notice of Award so long as Participant maintains continuous status as an Employee of the Company or a Subsidiary. Upon vesting, the Company shall, within thirty (30) days of such vesting, deliver to Participant the certificates evidencing the nonforfeitable shares, provided the withholding requirements of paragraph 4 have been satisfied. (b) If Participant ceases to maintain continuous status as an Employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason other than death or disability (as described in subparagraph (c)), all shares of Stock to the extent not yet vested under subparagraph (a) on the date Participant ceases to be a full-time employee shall be forfeited by Participant without payment of any consideration to Participant therefor. Any shares of Stock so forfeited shall be canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares, to be held for future distributions by the Company's 2002 Plan. (c) If Participant dies or in the event of termination of Participant's continuous status as an Employee as a result of disability (as determined by the Board in accordance with the policies of the Company) while a full-time employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Participant's interest in all shares of Stock awarded hereunder shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board, "disability" means that Participant ceases to be an employee on account of permanent and total disability as a result of which the Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long term disability policy.
4. WITHHOLDING OF TAXES. (a) GENERAL. Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by Participant in connection with the Stock awarded, regardless of any action the Company or any of its Subsidiaries takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Stock awarded. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of the Stock awarded or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Stock. The Company and its Subsidiaries do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the award to reduce or eliminate Participant's tax liability. (b) Payment of Withholding Taxes. Prior to any event in connection with the Stock awarded (E.G., vesting) that the Company determines may result in any tax withholding obligation, whether United States federal, state, local or non-U.S., including any employment tax obligation (the "Tax Withholding Obligation"), Participant must arrange for the satisfaction of the minimum amount of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company. (i) BY SHARE WITHHOLDING. Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, Participant authorizes the Company (in the exercise of its sole discretion) to withhold from those shares of Stock issuable to Participant the whole number of shares sufficient to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Participant acknowledges that the withheld shares may not be sufficient to satisfy Participant's minimum Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, Participant agrees to pay to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the withholding of shares described above. Share withholding will generally be used to satisfy the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation of individuals subject to the short-swing profit restrictions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. (ii) BY SALE OF SHARES. Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, Participant's acceptance of the Stock awarded constitutes Participant's instruction and authorization to the Company and any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose to sell on Participant's behalf a whole number of shares from those shares of Stock issuable to Participant as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Such shares will be sold on the day such Tax Withholding Obligation arises (E.G., a vesting date) or as soon thereafter as practicable. Participant will be responsible for all broker's fees and other costs of sale, and Participant agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale. To the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed Participant's minimum Tax Withholding Obligation, the Company agrees to pay such excess in cash to Participant. Participant acknowledges that the Company or its designee is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price, and that the proceeds of any such sale may not be sufficient to
satisfy Participant's minimum Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, Participant agrees to pay to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the sale of shares described above. (iii) BY CHECK, WIRE TRANSFER OR OTHER MEANS. At any time not less than five (5) business days (or such fewer number of days as determined by the Committee or its designee) before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises (E.G., a vesting date), Participant may elect to satisfy Participant's minimum Tax Withholding Obligation by delivering to the Company an amount that the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation by (x) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (y) delivery of a certified check payable to the Company, or (z) such other means as specified from time to time by the Committee or its designee. 5. SUCCESSORS. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. Nothing contained in the 2002 Plan or this Agreement shall be interpreted as imposing any liability on the Company or the Committee in favor of any Participant or any purchaser or other transferee of Stock with respect to any loss, cost or expense which such Participant or purchaser may incur in connection with, or arising out of any transaction involving any shares of Stock subject to the 2002 Plan or this Agreement. 6. INTEGRATION. The terms of the 2002 Plan and this Agreement are intended by the Company and Participant to be the final expression of their agreement with respect to the shares of Stock and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous agreement. The Company and Participant further intend that the 2002 Plan and this Agreement shall constitute the complete and exclusive statement of their terms and that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may be introduced in any arbitration, judicial, administrative or other legal proceeding involving the 2002 Plan or this Agreement. Accordingly, the 2002 Plan and this Agreement contain the entire understanding between the parties and supersede all prior oral, written and implied agreements, understandings, commitments and practices among the parties. 7. WAIVERS. Any failure to enforce any terms or conditions of the 2002 Plan or this Agreement by the Company or by Participant shall not be deemed a waiver of that term or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power for all or any other times. 8. SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. If any provision of the 2002 Plan or this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision thereof; and the 2002 Plan and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if neither of them included such provision. 9. COMMITTEE DECISIONS CONCLUSIVE. All decisions of the Committee arising under the 2002 Plan or under this Agreement shall be conclusive.
10. MANDATORY ARBITRATION. To the extent permitted by law, any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its meaning or interpretation, shall be resolved solely by arbitration before an arbitrator selected in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The location for the arbitration shall be in the county or comparable jurisdiction of Participant's employment. Judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each party shall pay an equal share of the arbitrator's fees. All statutes of limitation which would otherwise be applicable shall apply to any arbitration proceeding under this paragraph. The provisions of this paragraph are intended by Participant and Company to be exclusive for all purposes and applicable to any and all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement. The arbitrator who hears and decides any dispute shall have jurisdiction and authority only to award compensatory damages to make whole a person or entity sustaining foreseeable economic damages, and, shall not have jurisdiction and authority to make any other award of any type, including without limitation, punitive damages, unforeseeable economic damage, damages for pain, suffering or emotional distress, or any other kind or form of damages. The remedy, if any, awarded by the arbitrator shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any dispute which is subject to arbitration under this paragraph. 11. DELAWARE LAW. The 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced according to the laws of the State of Delaware to the extent not preempted by the federal laws of the United States of America.

ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. As of December 21, 2004, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company" or "Franklin") elected Mr. Samuel H. Armacost to fill one of two existing vacancies on the Board. As a non-employee director on the Board with no other relationship with the Company and its affiliates other than his prospective service to the Company as a non-employee director, Mr. Armacost shall receive the same compensation that other non-employee directors on the Board receive. Non-employee directors on the Board, such as Mr. Armacost, following their election to the Board, have been paid in the past $10,000 per quarter, plus $3,000 per meeting attended. However, effective January 1, 2005, directors who are not Franklin employees will be paid $12,500 per quarter, plus $3,000 per meeting and will receive an annual stock grant valued at $75,000 on the date of grant on January 25, 2005 and on the date of the annual organizational meeting of the Board in subsequent fiscal years. In addition, the Company has a policy of reimbursing certain health insurance coverage for a director who is retired from other employment and is not otherwise eligible for group health coverage under Franklin's group health plan or any other company's health plan. Franklin will reimburse the cost of health insurance coverage comparable to that provided to Franklin employees. Franklin also allows directors to defer payment of their directors' fees, and to treat the deferred amounts as hypothetical investments in Franklin common stock. Upon termination, the number of shares of stock that the director hypothetically purchased are added together, and Franklin must pay the director an amount equal to the value of the hypothetical investment, including dividend reinvestment. Either Franklin or the individual director can terminate the fee deferral with ninety days notice. ITEM 5.02 DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR PRINCIPAL OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF PRINCIPAL OFFICERS. (d) As of December 21, 2004, the Board of the Company elected each of Mr. Samuel H. Armacost and Ms. Anne M. Tatlock to fill the two existing vacancies on the Board. There were no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Armacost or Ms. Tatlock and any other person pursuant to which he or she was elected as a director, and there are and have been no transactions since the beginning of the Company's last fiscal year, or currently proposed, regarding Mr. Armacost or Ms. Tatlock that are required to be disclosed by Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K, except as set forth below. At the time of filing this Form 8-K, the Board has made no determination to appoint either Mr. Armacost or Ms. Tatlock to one or more committees of the Board. While Mr. Armacost is not, and has not been, an employee of the Company, Ms. Tatlock, in addition to becoming a director of the Company (an office she previously held from January 2001 through December 2, 2004), will continue to be a Vice Chairman and Member - Office of the Chairman of the Company, positions she has held since 2001, as well as continue to be Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, and a director of Fiduciary Trust Company International, a subsidiary of the Company. As a named executive officer of the Company, the Company has previously reported compensation and related information with regard to Ms. Tatlock in its prior reports and proxy statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The terms of the compensation receivable by Mr. Armacost for his services as a non-employee director on the Board are described under Item 1.01 above, which description is incorporated by reference in its entirety into this Item 5.02. The Company makes purchases of the Company's common stock from employees and executive officers on the same terms and conditions to pay taxes due in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and matching grants, which the Company provides under its Employee Stock Incentive Plan. On January 2, 2004 and in connection with the vesting of certain restricted stock awards, the Company purchased 1,205 shares from Ms. Tatlock at the price of $52.05 per share. On October 1, 2004 and in connection with the vesting on September 30, 2004 of certain restricted stock awards, the Company purchased 2,737 shares
from Ms. Tatlock, among others, at the price of $55.55 per share. The price per share paid by the Company for each purchase was the average of the high and low price of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the vesting date.

ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. On December 15, 2004, after the fiscal year 2004, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the grant of restricted stock awards under the 2002 Stock Plan to Mr. Flanagan and Mr. G. Johnson, the Company's Presidents and Co-Chief Executive Officers. The following were the numbers of shares and value of the restricted stock awards that were granted to Mr. Flanagan: 15,625 shares, ($1,000,000) and Mr. G. Johnson: 15,625 shares, ($1,000,000). The restricted stock awards vest upon the achievement of certain increases in pre-tax operating income for a fiscal year of the Corporation. Pre-tax operating income is defined as total operating revenue less total operating expenses determined on a consolidated basis and is reported in the Corporation's annual financial statements as operating income. One-third of the shares of restricted stock shall vest if pre-tax operating income for the 2005, 2006 or 2007 fiscal year is at least 15% greater than pre-tax operating income for the 2004 fiscal year. Two-thirds of the shares of restricted stock shall vest if pre-tax operating income for the 2005, 2006 or 2007 fiscal year is at least 32.25% greater than pre-tax operating income for the 2004 fiscal year. All of the shares of restricted stock shall vest if pre-tax operating income for the 2005, 2006 or 2007 fiscal year is at least 52.09% greater than pre-tax operating income for the 2004 fiscal year. After the conclusion of the 2007 fiscal year, any shares of restricted stock that do not vest based upon the achievement of the foregoing performance goals related to increases in pre-tax operating income shall be forfeited back to the Corporation. These awards differ in structure from those granted to other top contributing employees and officers of the Company, in that specific installments of restricted stock are subject to company-related performance metrics in order to be vested over a three-year period. Should those performance metrics not be achieved, the awards will be forfeited either in whole or in part at the end of the performance-vesting period. The Compensation Committee intended that the design and structure of the Co-Chief Executive Officer performance share awards be aligned wholly and clearly with the Company's performance, and therefore, the stockholders' interests. On December 23, 2004, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors established maximum individual target awards of $5,000,000 for the 2005 fiscal year for each of Mr. Flanagan and Mr. G. Johnson under the Company's 2004 Key Executive Incentive Compensation Plan. If the Company's operating profit margin is at least 26.35% for the 2005 fiscal year, then each participant will receive $1,500,000 of the aggregate maximum individual target awards. If such operating profit margin is less than 26.35%, then each participant will forfeit any right to receive this $1,500,000 portion of the target awards. If the average percentage growth of earnings per share and pre-tax operating income for the 2005 fiscal year is 25% or greater, then each participant will receive $3,500,000 of the aggregate maximum individual target awards. If such percentage is 20% to 24%, then the award will be $2,800,000; if the percentage is 15% to 19%, then the award will be $2,100,000; if the percentage is 10% to 14%, then the award will be $1,400,000; and if the percentage is 5% to 9%, then the award will be $700,000. If such percentage is less than 5%, then each participant will forfeit any right to receive this $3,500,000 portion of the maximum target award. Notwithstanding these potential target awards, the actual awards payable to either or both of Mr. Flanagan and Mr. G. Johnson are subject to the Compensation Committee's authority to reduce the award otherwise payable to the participant. The awards are payable in cash or Company stock at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.

MORNINGSTAR ratings and LIPPER rankings for Franklin Templeton U.S.-based funds are based on Class A shares, with the exception of LIPPER rankings for Mutual Series funds, which are based on Class Z shares. Class Z shares are offered to qualified investors only and have no sales charges nor Rule 12b-1 fees. Franklin Templeton funds are compared against a universe of all share classes. All Franklin Templeton Class A (Class Z) asset data is based on 11/30/04 figures unless noted otherwise. Indices are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in them. Fund performance comparisons with indices were calculated at the fund's NAV. Unless otherwise noted, fund returns quoted reflect Class A shares. Performance returns, ratings and rankings for other classes may vary. 3. LIPPER calculates averages by taking all the funds and share classes in a peer group and averaging their total returns for the periods indicated. LIPPER tracks 143 peer groups of long-term U.S. retail mutual funds, and the groups vary in size from 4 to 966 funds. LIPPER total return calculations include reinvested dividends and capital gains, but do not include sales charges or expense subsidization by the manager. Results may have been different if these or other factors had been considered. 4. Source: LIPPER(R) Inc., 12/31/04.

LIPPER Leaders Awards are based on Class A shares. LIPPER ratings for Consistent Return reflect funds' historical risk-adjusted returns, adjusted for volatility, relative to peers. LIPPER ratings for Total Return reflect funds' historical total return performance relative to peers. LIPPER ratings for Preservation reflect funds' historical loss avoidance relative to other funds within the same asset class. Preservation ratings are relative, rather than absolute, measures, and funds named LIPPER Leaders for Preservation may still experience losses periodically; those losses may be larger for equity and mixed equity funds than for fixed income funds. The LIPPER ratings are subject to change every month and are based on an equal-weighted average of percentile ranks for the Consistent Return, Total Return and Preservation metrics over three-, five- and 10-year periods (if applicable). 20% of funds in each peer group are named LIPPER Leaders, the next 20% receive a score of 2, the middle 20% are scored 3, the next 20% are scored 4, and the lowest 20% are scored 5. Bracketed information represents the number of funds in each category. N/A indicates that there were not enough funds in a category to constitute a class. Templeton World Fund, in LIPPER'S Global Multi-Cap Core classification, received the following ratings for the three-, five- and 10-year periods respectively: Consistent Return: 2 [44], 2 [23], 2 [7]. Franklin Income Fund, in LIPPER'S Income classification, received the following ratings for the three-, five- and 10-year periods respectively: Preservation (in Mixed Equity asset class): LIPPER Leader [945], LIPPER Leader [746], LIPPER Leader [301]; Total Return: LIPPER Leader [115], LIPPER Leader [79], 2 [20]. Templeton Growth Fund, in LIPPER'S Global Large-Cap Value classification, received the following ratings for the three-, five- and 10-year periods respectively: Consistent Return: LIPPER Leader [23], LIPPER Leader [18], N/A [N/A]; Preservation (in Mixed Equity asset class): LIPPER Leader [7532], LIPPER Leader [5340], LIPPER Leader [1772]; Total Return: LIPPER Leader [23], LIPPER Leader [18], N/A [N/A]. Franklin Federal Tax-Free Income Fund, in LIPPER'S General Municipal Debt classification, received the following ratings for the three-, five- and 10-year periods respectively: Tax Efficiency: LIPPER Leader [269], LIPPER Leader [234], LIPPER Leader [139].

For each fund with at least a three-year history, MORNINGSTAR calculates a MORNINGSTAR Rating based on a MORNINGSTAR Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) THE OVERALL MORNINGSTAR RATING FOR A FUND IS DERIVED FROM A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE OF THE PERFORMANCE FIGURES ASSOCIATED WITH ITS THREE-, FIVE- AND 10-YEAR (IF APPLICABLE) MORNINGSTAR RATING METRICS. PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS. MORNINGSTAR Rating is for the A share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics. The following fund was rated against 228; 164; 53 Conservative Allocation funds for the respective three-, five- and 10-year periods ended 12/31/04, as applicable. For the three-, five- and 10-year periods ended 12/31/04, the MORNINGSTAR ratings were: Franklin Income Fund 5, 5, 5. The following funds were rated against 274; 208; 73 World Stock funds for the respective three-, five- and 10-year periods ended 12/31/04, as applicable. For the three-, five- and 10-year periods ended 12/31/04, the MORNINGSTAR ratings were: Templeton Growth Fund 4, 4, 4 and Templeton World Fund 3, 4, 4.

ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. DEFERRED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENT FOR DIRECTOR'S FEES WITH SAMUEL ARMACOST On January 21, 2005, Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company" or "Franklin") entered into a Franklin Resources, Inc. Deferred Compensation Arrangement for Director's Fees (the "Arrangement") with Samuel H. Armacost, one of the Company's non-employee directors, pursuant to which Mr. Armacost has elected to defer delivery of all annual and other stock grants that otherwise would have been made to him as compensation for service as a director of the Company until a future date. Under the terms of the Arrangement, Mr. Armacost may make elections from time to time to defer payment of some or all of his director's fees or annual or other stock grants. Except with the initial election, which Mr. Armacost had to make within 30 days of becoming eligible to participate under the Arrangement, any future elections by Mr. Armacost must be made prior to the calendar year in which Mr. Armacost earns the compensation, although Mr. Armacost may elect, at any time, to change his distribution date(s), provided that certain conditions, as set out in the Arrangement, with regard to the election and the payment of distributions are met. The Company will allocate performance units for the benefit of Mr. Armacost equivalent to all such deferred amounts. The performance units constitute notional shares of common stock of the Company and are credited with notional dividends at the same time, in the same form, and in equivalent amounts as dividends that are payable from time to time on shares of common stock of the Company. Any such notional dividends are reallocated to acquire additional performance units for the benefit of Mr. Armacost equivalent to such dividend amounts. Under the Arrangement, the value of such performance units, as adjusted for losses or gains and notional dividends through the date of distribution, shall be paid out in cash to Mr. Armacost on date(s) determined by him, subject to certain exceptions as set out in the Arrangement. Mr. Armacost may terminate his participation in the Arrangement at any time prior to December 31, 2005 with regard to any deferrals made prior to that time as well as any future deferrals and, upon such termination, distribution of all of Mr. Armacost's then deferred amounts shall be made in cash and shall occur as soon as practicable. The Company may amend or suspend the Arrangement at any time and for any reason, provided that no amendment of the Arrangement may adversely affect Mr. Armacost's rights under the Arrangement without his prior written consent. This brief description of the Arrangement is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Arrangement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference. FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. 2002 UNIVERSAL STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED AND RESTATED On January 25, 2005, the stockholders of the Company at the 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company approved the amendment and restatement of the Company's 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (as amended and restated, the "2002 Stock Plan"). The primary purposes of the amendment and restatement were to (a) add additional performance measures applicable to the grant of awards under the Company's 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (the "Original Plan") intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and (b) expand the ability of the administrator of the Original Plan to adjust awards issued under the plan in connection with various changes in the capitalization of the Company. The brief description of the 2002 Stock Plan set forth below is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2002 Stock Plan, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference. PURPOSE - ------- The 2002 Stock Plan is intended to: (i) attract and retain persons eligible to participate in the plan; (ii) motivate employees, by means of appropriate incentives, to achieve long-range performance goals; (iii) provide incentive compensation opportunities that are competitive with those of other similar companies; and (iv) further align employees' interests with those of Franklin's other stockholders through compensation that is based on Franklin's common stock. ADMINISTRATION OF THE 2002 STOCK PLAN - ------------------------------------- The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Compensation Committee"), as the administrator of the 2002 Stock Plan, determines and approves the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock units, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance shares to employees. The Compensation Committee will, with regard to each stock option, determine the number of shares subject to the option, the manner and time of the option's exercise and vesting, and the exercise price per share of stock subject to the option. The exercise price for incentive stock options may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date the option is granted (or 110%, in the case of an incentive stock option granted to any employee who owns stock representing more than 10% of the combined voting power of Franklin or any parent or subsidiary of Franklin). In the case of all other awards granted under the 2002 Stock Plan, the exercise or purchase price shall be determined by the Compensation Committee. SHARES AUTHORIZED - ----------------- The 2002 Stock Plan authorizes 30,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2002 Stock Plan. ELIGIBILITY - ----------- Under the terms of the 2002 Stock Plan, any key executive or other employee of Franklin or any of its subsidiaries is eligible to participate. TERM OF AWARDS - -------------- The term of any incentive stock option may not be for more than ten years (or five years in the case of an incentive stock option granted to any participant who owns stock representing more than 10%
of the combined voting power of Franklin or any parent or subsidiary of the Company). The term of all other awards shall be determined by the Compensation Committee. TRANSFERABILITY - --------------- An employee's rights under the 2002 Stock Plan may not be assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. PERFORMANCE BASED COMPENSATION - ------------------------------ The maximum number of shares with respect to which options and stock appreciation rights may be granted to a participant during a calendar year is 400,000 shares. The foregoing limitation shall be adjusted proportionately by the Compensation Committee in connection with any change in Franklin's capitalization due to a stock split, stock dividend or similar event affecting the common stock of Franklin. Under Code Section 162(m) no deduction is allowed in any taxable year of Franklin for compensation in excess of $1 million paid to Franklin's chief executive officer and the four other most highly compensated officers of Franklin. An exception to this rule applies to compensation that is paid pursuant to a stock incentive plan approved by stockholders and that specifies, among other things, the maximum number of shares with respect to which options and stock appreciation rights may be granted to eligible participants under such plan during a specified period. Compensation paid pursuant to options or stock appreciation rights granted under such a plan and with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of Franklin's common stock on the date of grant is deemed to be inherently performance-based, since such awards provide value to participants only if the stock price appreciates. For awards of stock units, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance shares that are intended to be performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, the maximum number of shares subject to such awards that may be granted to a participant during a calendar year is 1,000,000 shares (regardless of when such shares are deliverable to the participant). In order for such awards to qualify as performance-based compensation, the Compensation Committee must establish a performance goal with respect to such award in writing not later than 90 days after the commencement of the services to which it relates and while the outcome is substantially uncertain. In addition, the performance goal must be stated in terms of an objective formula or standard. Under the 2002 Stock Plan, the Compensation Committee may use the following performance criteria when granting performance-based awards: earnings per share; pre-tax operating income; the value of Franklin stock (i.e., stock price); annual revenue; budget comparisons; controllable profits; expense management; improvements in capital structure; operating income; net income; net sales; profit margins; profitability of an identifiable business unit or product; return on investments; return on sales; return on stockholders' equity; total return to stockholders; and performance of Franklin relative to a peer group of companies on any of the foregoing measures. The performance criteria may be applicable to Franklin and/or any of its individual business units and may differ from participant to participant.
CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION - ------------------------- The 2002 Stock Plan provides that subject to any required action by the stockholders of Franklin, (a) the number and/or class of securities covered by each outstanding award, (b) the price per share covered by each such outstanding award, (c) the number and/or class of securities which have been authorized for issuance under the 2002 Stock Plan but as to which no awards have yet been granted or which have been returned to the 2002 Stock Plan upon cancellation or expiration of an award, and (d) the maximum number of options, stock appreciation rights, stock unit awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards and performance share awards which may be granted to any participant in any one-calendar-year period shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of common stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the common stock, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of common stock effected without receipt of consideration by Franklin. Such adjustment will be made by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee may also make, in its discretion, adjustments described in (a) - (d) above in the event of any distribution of cash or other assets to stockholders other than an ordinary cash dividend. In determining adjustments to be made, the Compensation Committee may take into account such factors as it deems appropriate, including (i) the restrictions of applicable law, (ii) the potential tax, accounting or other consequences of an adjustment and (iii) the possibility that some participants might receive an adjustment and a distribution or other unintended benefit, and in light of such factors or circumstances may make adjustments that are not uniform or proportionate among outstanding awards, modify vesting dates, defer the delivery of stock certificates or make other equitable adjustments. Any such adjustments to outstanding awards will be effected in a manner that precludes the enlargement of rights and benefits under such awards. Any adjustments, determinations or interpretations made by the Compensation Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive. AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION - ------------------------- The Board of Directors of Franklin may at any time terminate or amend the 2002 Stock Plan. However, no such termination may affect awards previously granted, nor may an amendment make any change in any award previously granted which adversely affects the rights of any participant. In addition, to the extent necessary to comply with securities and tax laws, Franklin will obtain stockholder approval of such termination or such amendments.

The right of the Participant and his Beneficiary to receive a distribution hereunder shall be an unsecured claim against the general assets of the Company, and neither the Participant nor his Beneficiary shall have any rights in or against any amount credited to the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account or any other specific assets of the Company, except as otherwise provided in the Trust Agreement. The Deferred Compensation Account shall be kept solely as a nominal account, may be carried in cash or any other liquid assets, may be invested in Common Stock, or may be invested in any other assets as may be selected by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion.

All Trust Funds shall be subject to the claims of general creditors of the Company in the event the Company is insolvent as defined in the Trust Agreement. The obligations of the Company to pay benefits under the Arrangement and the obligation of the Trustee to pay benefits under the Trust constitute an unfunded, unsecured promise to pay benefits in the future and the Participant and his Beneficiary shall have no greater rights than general creditors of the Company.

EXHIBIT 10.2 FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. 2002 UNIVERSAL STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (as amended and restated December 16, 2004) 1. GENERAL 1.1 PURPOSE. The Franklin Resources, Inc. 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (the "2002 Stock Plan") has been established by Franklin Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company") to (i) attract and retain persons eligible to participate in the 2002 Stock Plan; (ii) motivate employees, by means of appropriate incentives, to achieve long-range performance goals; (iii) provide incentive compensation opportunities that are competitive with those of other similar companies; and (iv) further identify employees' interests with those of the Company's other stockholders through compensation that is based on the Company's common stock; and thereby promote the long-term financial interest of the Company and the Subsidiaries. 1.2 PARTICIPATION. Subject to the terms and conditions of the 2002 Stock Plan, the Committee shall determine and designate, from time to time, from among the Participants, those persons who will be granted one or more Awards under the 2002 Stock Plan. In the discretion of the Committee, a Participant may be granted any Award permitted under the provisions of the 2002 Stock Plan, and more than one Award may be granted to a Participant. Awards may be granted as alternatives to or replacement of awards outstanding under the 2002 Stock Plan, or any other plan or arrangement of the Company or a Subsidiary (including a plan or arrangement of a business or entity, all or a portion of which is acquired by the Company or a Subsidiary). 1.3 OPERATION, ADMINISTRATION, AND DEFINITIONS. The operation and administration of the 2002 Stock Plan, including the Awards made under the 2002 Stock Plan, shall be subject to the provisions of Section 4 (relating to operation and administration). Capitalized terms in the 2002 Stock Plan shall be defined as set forth in the 2002 Stock Plan (including the definition provisions of Section 8 of the 2002 Stock Plan). 1.4 STOCK SUBJECT TO 2002 STOCK PLAN; SHARE COUNTING. Subject to the provisions of this Section 1.4 and Section 6.1 of the 2002 Stock Plan, the maximum aggregate number of shares which may be delivered pursuant to Awards, including without limitation, Options and SAR's granted under the 2002 Stock Plan, is 30,000,000. The shares may be authorized, but unissued, or reacquired Common Stock. (a) To the extent any Shares covered by an Award are not delivered to a Participant or beneficiary because the Award is forfeited or canceled, or the Shares are not delivered because the Award is settled in cash, such Shares shall not be deemed to have been delivered for purposes of determining the maximum number of Shares available for delivery pursuant to Awards granted under the 2002 Stock Plan. (b) If the exercise price of any Option granted under the 2002 Stock Plan is satisfied by tendering Shares to the Company (by either actual delivery or by attestation), only the number of Shares issued net of the Shares tendered shall be deemed delivered for purposes of
determining the maximum number of Shares available for delivery pursuant to Awards (other than Options) granted under the 2002 Stock Plan. (c) Subject to adjustment under Section 6.1, (i) the maximum number of shares that may be granted to any one individual pursuant to Section 2 (relating to Options and SARs) shall be 400,000 Shares during any one-calendar-year period and (ii) the maximum number of Shares that may be granted to any one individual subject to Section 3 (relating to Stock Unit Awards, Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Unit Awards and Performance Share Awards) shall be 1,000,000 Shares during any one-calendar-year period (regardless of when such Shares are deliverable). 2. OPTIONS AND SARS 2.1 OPTIONS. (a) An Option is a grant of rights to purchase Shares at an Exercise Price established by the Committee. Options granted under this Section 2 may be either Incentive Stock Options ("ISO") or Nonstatutory Stock Options ("NSO"), as determined in the discretion of the Committee. (b) Each Option shall be designated in the written option agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. However, notwithstanding such designations, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Options designated as Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any Optionee during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, such excess Options shall be automatically treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For purposes of this paragraph 2.1(b), Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted, and the Fair Market Value of the Shares shall be determined as of the original date the Option with respect to such Shares is granted. (c) The term of each Option shall be the term stated in the Option Agreement; provided, however, that in the case of any Incentive Stock Option, the term shall be no more than ten (10) years from the date of grant thereof or such shorter term as may be provided in the Option Agreement. However, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Optionee who, at the time the Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Option shall be five (5) years from the date of grant thereof or such shorter term as may be provided in the Option Agreement. (d) The date of grant of an Option shall, for all purposes, be the date on which the Committee makes the determination granting such Option, or such other date as is determined by the Board. Notice of the determination shall be given to each Participant to whom an Option is so granted within a reasonable time after the date of such grant. 2.2 STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS. A "Stock Appreciation Right" ("SAR") is a grant of rights to receive, in cash or Stock (as determined by the Committee), value equal to (or otherwise
based on) the excess of: (a) the Fair Market Value of a specified number of Shares at the time of exercise; over (b) an Exercise Price established by the Committee. 2.3 EXERCISE PRICE. The Exercise Price of each Option and SAR shall be established by the Committee or shall be determined by a method established by the Committee at the time the Option or SAR is granted; provided that: (a) In the case of an ISO, (i) granted to an employee who, at the time of the grant of such Incentive Stock Option, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant. (ii) granted to any employee, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant. 2.4 TIME AND MANNER OF EXERCISE. Options and SARs shall be exercisable in accordance with such terms and conditions and during such periods as may be established by the Committee; subject to the following terms regarding Options: (a) TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT. In the event of termination of an Optionee's Continuous Status as an employee with the Company, such Optionee may, but only within ninety (90) days after the date of such termination (or such other period as is set out by the Committee in the Option Agreement, but in no event later than the expiration date of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement), exercise the Option to the extent that Optionee was entitled to exercise it at the date of such termination. To the extent that Optionee was not entitled to exercise the Option at the date of such termination, or if Optionee does not exercise such Option to the extent so entitled within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate. (b) DISABILITY OF OPTIONEE. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2.4(a) above, in the event of termination of an Optionee's Continuous Status as an employee as a result of disability (as determined by the Board in accordance with the policies of the Company), Optionee may, but only within six (6) months from the date of such termination (or such other period as is set out by the Committee in the Option Agreement, but in no event later than the expiration date of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement), exercise the Option to the extent otherwise entitled to exercise it at the date of such termination. To the extent that Optionee was not entitled to exercise the Option at the date of termination, or if Optionee does not exercise such Option to the extent so entitled within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate. (c) DEATH OF OPTIONEE. In the event of the death of an Optionee, the Option may be exercised, at any time within twelve (12) months following the date of death (or such other period as is set out by the Committee in the Option Agreement, but in no event later than the expiration date of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement), by the Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent the Optionee was entitled to exercise the Option at the date of
death. To the extent that Optionee was not entitled to exercise the Option at the date of termination, or if Optionee does not exercise such Option to the extent so entitled within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate. 2.5 PAYMENT OF EXERCISE PRICE. Payment of the Exercise Price of an Option shall be subject to the following: (a) The full Exercise Price for Shares purchased upon the exercise of any Option shall be paid at the time of such exercise (except that, in the case of an exercise arrangement approved by the Committee and described in paragraph 2.5(b), payment may be made as soon as practicable after the exercise). (b) The consideration to be paid for the Shares to be issued upon exercise of an Option, including the method of payment, shall be determined by the Committee (and, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, shall be determined at the time of grant) and may consist entirely of (i) cash, (ii) check, (iii) other Shares (by delivery of certificates or attestation) which (x) either have been owned by the Optionee for more than six months on the date of surrender or were not acquired, directly or indirectly, from the Company, and (y) have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which said Option shall be exercised, (iv) delivery of authorization for the Company to retain from the total number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised that number of Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the exercise price for the total number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised, (v) delivery of a properly executed exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to the Company the amount of sale or loan proceeds required to pay the exercise price, (vi) irrevocably authorizing a third party to sell Shares (or a sufficient portion of the shares) acquired upon exercise of the Option and remit to the Company a sufficient portion of the sale proceeds to pay the entire Exercise Price and any tax withholding resulting from such exercise, (vii) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment, (viii) or such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance of Shares to the extent permitted under Applicable Laws. 2.6 SETTLEMENT OF AWARD. Shares delivered pursuant to the exercise of an Option or SAR shall be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee may establish in the applicable Award Agreement at the time of grant. Settlement of SARs may be made in Shares (valued at their Fair Market Value at the time of exercise), in cash, or in a combination thereof, as determined in the discretion of the Committee. The Committee, in its discretion, may impose such conditions, restrictions and contingencies with respect to Shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Option or an SAR as the Committee determines to be desirable.
3. OTHER STOCK AWARDS 3.1 DEFINITIONS. (a) A "Stock Unit" Award is the grant of a right to receive Shares in the future. (b) A "Performance Share" Award is a grant of a right to receive Shares or Stock Units which is contingent on the achievement of performance or other objectives during a specified period. (c) A "Restricted Stock" Award is a grant of Shares, and a "Restricted Stock Unit" Award is the grant of a right to receive Shares in the future, with such Shares or right to future delivery of such Shares subject to a risk of forfeiture or other restrictions that will lapse upon the achievement of one or more goals relating to completion of service by the Participant, or achievement of performance or other objectives, as determined by the Committee. 3.2 RESTRICTIONS ON STOCK AWARDS. Each Stock Unit Award, Restricted Stock Award, Restricted Stock Unit Award and Performance Share Award shall be subject to the following: (a) Any such Award shall be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee shall determine. (b) The Committee may designate whether any such Award being granted to any Participant are intended to be "performance-based compensation" as that term is used in Section 162(m) of the Code. Any such Awards designated as intended to be "performance-based compensation" shall be conditioned on the achievement of one or more Performance Measures. The Performance Measures that may be used by the Committee for such Awards shall be based on any one or more of the criteria attached hereto on Attachment I, as selected and further defined by the Committee. The Performance Measures may be applicable to the Company and/or any of its individual business units and may differ from Participant to Participant. For Awards intended to be "performance-based compensation," the grant of the Awards and the establishment of the Performance Measures shall be made during the period required under Section 162(m) of the Code and shall be subject to the individual share limit set out in Section 1.4(c) above. 4. OPERATION AND ADMINISTRATION 4.1 EFFECTIVE DATE. The 2002 Stock Plan became effective as of October 10, 2002. The 2002 Stock Plan shall be unlimited in duration and, in the event of the 2002 Stock Plan termination, shall remain in effect as long as any Awards under it are outstanding; provided, however, that, to the extent required by the Code, no ISO may be granted under the 2002 Stock Plan after October 9, 2012. 4.2 GENERAL RESTRICTIONS. Delivery of Shares or other amounts under the 2002 Stock Plan shall be subject to the following:
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of the 2002 Stock Plan, the Company shall have no liability to deliver any Shares under the 2002 Stock Plan or make any other distribution of benefits under the 2002 Stock Plan unless such delivery or distribution would comply with all applicable laws (including, without limitation, the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933), and the applicable requirements of any securities exchange or similar entity. (b) To the extent that the 2002 Stock Plan provides for issuance of stock certificates to reflect the issuance of Shares, the issuance may be effected on a non-certificated basis, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange. 4.3 TAX WITHHOLDING. All distributions under the 2002 Stock Plan are subject to withholding of all applicable taxes, and the Committee may condition the delivery of any shares or other benefits under the 2002 Stock Plan on satisfaction of the applicable withholding obligations. The Committee, in its discretion, and subject to such requirements as the Committee may impose prior to the occurrence of such withholding, may permit such withholding obligations to be satisfied through cash payment by the Participant, through the surrender of Shares which the Participant already owns, or through the surrender of Shares to which the Participant is otherwise entitled under the 2002 Stock Plan, provided; however, that in either case only the number of Shares sufficient to satisfy the Company's minimum required tax withholding obligations may be surrendered to the Company. 4.4 USE OF SHARES. Subject to the overall limitation on the number of Shares that may be delivered under the 2002 Stock Plan, the Committee may use available Shares as the form of payment for compensation, grants or rights earned or due under any other compensation plans or arrangements of the Company or a Subsidiary, including the plans and arrangements of the Company or a Subsidiary assumed in business combinations. 4.5 DIVIDENDS AND DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS. An Award (including without limitation an Option or SAR Award) may provide the Participant with the right to receive dividend payments or dividend equivalent payments with respect to Stock subject to the Award (both before and after the Stock subject to the Award is earned, vested, or acquired), which payments may be either made currently or credited to an account for the Participant, and may be settled in cash or Stock as determined by the Committee. Any such settlements, and any such crediting of dividends or dividend equivalents or reinvestment in Shares, may be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee shall establish, including the reinvestment of such credited amounts in Stock equivalents. 4.6 PAYMENTS. Awards may be settled through cash payments, the delivery of Shares, the granting of replacement Awards, or combination thereof as the Committee shall determine. Any Award settlement, including payment deferrals, may be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee shall determine. The Committee may permit or require the deferral of any Award payment, subject to such rules and procedures as it may establish, which may include provisions for the payment or crediting of interest, or dividend equivalents, including converting such credits into deferred Stock equivalents. Each Subsidiary shall be liable for payment of cash due under the 2002 Stock Plan with respect to any Participant to the extent that such benefits are attributable to the services rendered for that Subsidiary by the
Participant. Any disputes relating to liability of a Subsidiary for cash payments shall be resolved by the Committee. 4.7 TRANSFERABILITY. Unless specifically provided by the Committee in the Award Agreement, Awards under the 2002 Stock Plan are nontransferable except as designated by the Participant by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. 4.8 FORM AND TIME OF ELECTIONS.

The terms and conditions of any Award to any Participant shall be reflected in such form of written document as is determined by the Committee. A copy of such document shall be provided to the Participant, and the Committee may, but need not require that the Participant shall sign a copy of such document. Such document is referred to in the 2002 Stock Plan as an "Award Agreement" regardless of whether any Participant signature is required. 4.10 ACTION BY COMPANY OR SUBSIDIARY. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary shall be by resolution of its board of directors, or by action of one or more members of the board (including a committee of the board) who are duly authorized to act for the board, or (except to the extent prohibited by applicable law or applicable rules of any stock exchange) by a duly authorized officer of the Company. 4.11 GENDER AND NUMBER. Where the context admits, words in any gender shall include any other gender, words in the singular shall include the plural and the plural shall include the singular. 4.12 LIMITATION OF IMPLIED RIGHTS. (a) Neither a Participant nor any other person shall, by reason of participation in the 2002 Stock Plan, acquire any right in or title to any assets, funds or property of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary whatsoever, including, without limitation, any specific funds, assets, or other property which the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, in their sole discretion, may set aside in anticipation of a liability under the 2002 Stock Plan. A Participant shall have only a contractual right to the Stock or amounts, if any, payable under the 2002 Stock Plan, unsecured by any assets of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, and nothing contained in the 2002 Stock Plan shall constitute a guarantee that the assets of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary shall be sufficient to pay any benefits to any person. (b) The 2002 Stock Plan does not constitute a contract of employment, and selection as a Participant will not give any Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary, nor any right or claim to any benefit under the 2002 Stock Plan, unless such right or claim has specifically accrued under the terms of the 2002 Stock Plan.
Except as otherwise provided in the 2002 Stock Plan, no Award under the 2002 Stock Plan shall confer upon the holder thereof any rights as a stockholder of the Company prior to the date on which the individual fulfills all conditions for receipt of such rights. 5. COMMITTEE 5.1 COMMITTEE. The authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the 2002 Stock Plan shall be vested in a committee (the "Committee") in accordance with this Section 5. The Committee shall be selected by the Board, and shall be comprised, unless otherwise determined by the Board, solely of not less than two members of the Board who shall be "outside" directors within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.162-27(e)(3) under Section 162(m) of the Code. With respect to Awards granted under the 2002 Stock Plan that are not intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee shall be composed of two or more members of the Board who are not employees of the Company. If the Committee does not exist, or for any other reason determined by the Board, the Board may take any action under the 2002 Stock Plan that would otherwise be the responsibility of the Committee. 5.2 POWERS OF COMMITTEE. The Committee's administration of the 2002 Stock Plan shall be subject to the following: (a) Subject to the provisions of the 2002 Stock Plan, the Committee will have the authority and discretion to select from among the Participants those persons who shall receive Awards, to determine the time or times of receipt, to determine the types of Awards and the number of shares covered by the Awards, to establish the terms, conditions, performance criteria (except that for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code, performance measures shall be based on one or more of the criteria set out on Attachment I hereto) , restrictions, and other provisions of such Awards, and (subject to Section 7) to cancel or suspend Awards. (b) To the extent that the Committee determines that the restrictions imposed by the 2002 Stock Plan preclude the achievement of the material purposes of the Awards in jurisdictions outside the United States, the Committee will have the authority and discretion to modify those restrictions as the Committee determines to be necessary or appropriate to conform to applicable requirements or practices of jurisdictions outside of the United States. (c) The Committee may grant Awards to Participants who are subject to the tax laws of nations other than the United States, which Awards may have terms and conditions as determined by the Committee as necessary to comply with applicable foreign laws. The Committee may take any action which it deems advisable to obtain approval of such Awards by the appropriate foreign government entity; provided however that no such Awards may be granted under this 2002 Stock Plan and no action may be taken which would result in a violation of the Exchange Act, the Code or any other applicable law. (d) The Committee will have the authority and discretion to interpret the 2002 Stock Plan, to establish, amend, and rescind any rules and regulations relating to the 2002 Stock Plan, to determine the terms and provisions of any Award Agreement made pursuant to the 2002
Stock Plan, and to make all other determinations that may be necessary or advisable for the administration of the 2002 Stock Plan. (e) Any interpretation of the 2002 Stock Plan by the Committee and any decision made by it under the 2002 Stock Plan is final and binding on all persons. (f) In controlling and managing the operation and administration of the 2002 Stock Plan, the Committee shall take action in a manner that conforms to the articles and by-laws of the Company, and applicable state corporate law. 5.3 DELEGATION BY COMMITTEE. Except to the extent prohibited by Applicable Law or the applicable rules of a stock exchange, the Committee may allocate all or any portion of its responsibilities and powers to any one or more of its members and may delegate all or any part of its administrative duties to any person or persons selected by it. Any such allocation or delegation may be revoked by the Committee at any time. 5.4 INFORMATION TO BE FURNISHED TO COMMITTEE. The Company and its Parent and Subsidiaries shall furnish the Committee with such data and information as it determines may be required for it to discharge its duties. The records of the Company and its Parent and Subsidiaries as to a Participant's employment, termination of employment, leave of absence, reemployment and compensation shall be conclusive on all persons unless determined to be incorrect. Participants entitled to benefits under the 2002 Stock Plan must furnish the Committee such evidence, data or information as the Committee considers desirable to carry out the terms of the 2002 Stock Plan. 6. ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION OR CORPORATE TRANSACTION 6.1 CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION. Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company, (a) the number and/or class of securities covered by each outstanding Award, (b) the price per share covered by each such outstanding Award, (c) the number and/or class of securities which have been authorized for issuance under the 2002 Stock Plan but as to which no Awards have yet been granted or which have been returned to the 2002 Stock Plan upon cancellation or expiration of an Award, and (d) the maximum number of Options, SARs, Stock Unit Awards, Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Units Awards and Performance Share Awards which may be granted to any Participant in any one-calendar-year period shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Common Stock, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration." Such adjustment shall be made by the Committee. The Committee may also make, in its discretion, adjustments described in (a)-(d) of this Section 6.1 in the event of any distribution of cash or other assets to stockholders other than an ordinary cash dividend. In determining adjustments to be made under this Section 6.1, the Committee may take into account such factors as it deems appropriate, including (i) the restrictions of applicable law, (ii) the potential tax, accounting or other consequences of an
adjustment and (iii) the possibility that some Participants might receive an adjustment and a distribution or other unintended benefit, and in light of such factors or circumstances may make adjustments that are not uniform or proportionate among outstanding Awards, modify vesting dates, defer the delivery of stock certificates or make other equitable adjustments. Any such adjustments to outstanding Awards will be effected in a manner that precludes the enlargement of rights and benefits under such Awards. Adjustments, if any, and any determinations or interpretations, including any determination of whether a distribution is other than an ordinary cash dividend, made by the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of Shares of any class, or securities convertible into Shares of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of Common Stock subject to an Award. 6.2 TRANSACTIONS. In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company or of a merger or corporate combination (a "Transaction") in which the successor corporation does not agree to assume the Award or substitute an equivalent Award, the Committee shall make a determination (subject to Section 7) as to the equitable treatment of outstanding Awards under the 2002 Stock Plan and shall notify Participants of such treatment no later than ten (10) days prior to such proposed Transaction. To the extent it has not been previously exercised, an Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed Transaction. 7. AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION The Board may, at any time, amend or terminate the 2002 Stock Plan, provided that no amendment or termination may, in the absence of written consent to the change by the affected Participant (or, if the Participant is not then living, the affected beneficiary), adversely affect the rights of any Participant or beneficiary under any Award granted under the 2002 Stock Plan prior to the date such amendment is adopted by the Board; provided that adjustments pursuant to Section 6.2 shall in no event be deemed to have an adverse effect on any Award. 8. DEFINED TERMS In addition to the other definitions contained herein, the following definitions shall apply: (a) APPLICABLE LAW means the corporate, securities and tax laws (including, without limitation, the Delaware corporate law, the Exchange Act, the Securities Act of 1933 and the Code) applicable to the establishment and administration of an employee stock incentive plans.

UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 FORM 8-K/A AMENDMENT NO. 1 CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 OR 15(d) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported): December 21, 2004 FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) Delaware 1-9318 13-2670991 (State or other jurisdiction (Commission File Number) (IRS Employer of incorporation) Identification No.) One Franklin Parkway, San Mateo, California 94403 (Address of principal executive offices) (Zip Code) Registrant's telephone number, including area code: (650) 312-3000 Not Applicable (Former name or former address, if changed since last report) Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (See General Instruction A.2. below): [ ] Written communications pursuant to Rule 425 under the Securities Act (17 CFR 230.425) [ ] Soliciting material pursuant to Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14a-12) [ ] Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 14d-2(b) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14d-2(b)) [ ] Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 13e-4(c) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13e-4(c))
EXPLANATORY NOTE This Form 8-K/A amends Item 5.02(d) of the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Franklin Resources, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 23, 2004 (the "Original 8-K") solely in order to update the disclosure as to the naming of Mr. Samuel H. Armacost to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Franklin Resources, Inc. on January 25, 2005, pursuant to the requirements of Instruction 2 to Item 5.02 of Form 8-K. This amendment to the Original 8-K is not intended to update any other information presented in the Original 8-K, which information speaks as of the date originally filed, except as specifically noted above. ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. As of December 21, 2004, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company" or "Franklin") elected Mr. Samuel H. Armacost to fill one of two existing vacancies on the Board. As a non-employee director on the Board with no other relationship with the Company and its affiliates other than his prospective service to the Company as a non-employee director, Mr. Armacost shall receive the same compensation that other non-employee directors on the Board receive. Non-employee directors on the Board, such as Mr. Armacost, following their election to the Board, have been paid in the past $10,000 per quarter, plus $3,000 per meeting attended. However, effective January 1, 2005, directors who are not Franklin employees will be paid $12,500 per quarter, plus $3,000 per meeting and will receive an annual stock grant valued at $75,000 on the date of grant on January 25, 2005 and on the date of the annual organizational meeting of the Board in subsequent fiscal years. In addition, the Company has a policy of reimbursing certain health insurance coverage for a director who is retired from other employment and is not otherwise eligible for group health coverage under Franklin's group health plan or any other company's health plan. Franklin will reimburse the cost of health insurance coverage comparable to that provided to Franklin employees. Franklin also allows directors to defer payment of their directors' fees, and to treat the deferred amounts as hypothetical investments in Franklin common stock. Upon termination, the number of shares of stock that the director hypothetically purchased are added together, and Franklin must pay the director an amount equal to the value of the hypothetical investment, including dividend reinvestment. Either Franklin or the individual director can terminate the fee deferral with ninety days notice. ITEM 5.02 DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR PRINCIPAL OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF PRINCIPAL OFFICERS. (d) As of December 21, 2004, the Board of the Company elected each of Mr. Samuel H. Armacost and Ms. Anne M. Tatlock to fill the two existing vacancies on the Board. There were no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Armacost or Ms. Tatlock and any other person pursuant to which he or she was elected as a director, and there are and have been no transactions since the beginning of the Company's last fiscal year, or currently proposed, regarding Mr. Armacost or Ms. Tatlock that are required to be disclosed by Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K, except as set forth below. At the time of filing the Form 8-K, the Board had made no determination to appoint either Mr. Armacost or Ms. Tatlock to one or more committees of the Board. At its meeting on January 25, 2005, the Board determined to appoint Mr. Armacost to the Compensation Committee of the Board. While Mr. Armacost is not, and has not been, an employee of the Company, Ms. Tatlock, in addition to becoming a director of the Company (an office she previously held from January 2001 through December 2, 2004), will continue to be a Vice Chairman and Member - Office of the Chairman of the Company, positions she has held since 2001, as well as continue to be Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, and a director of Fiduciary Trust Company International, a subsidiary of the Company. As a named executive officer of the Company, the Company has previously reported compensation and related information with regard to Ms. Tatlock in its prior reports and proxy statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The terms of the compensation receivable by Mr.
Armacost for his services as a non-employee director on the Board are described under Item 1.01 above, which description is incorporated by reference in its entirety into this Item 5.02. The Company makes purchases of the Company's common stock from employees and executive officers on the same terms and conditions to pay taxes due in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and matching grants, which the Company provides under its Employee Stock Incentive Plan. On January 2, 2004 and in connection with the vesting of certain restricted stock awards, the Company purchased 1,205 shares from Ms. Tatlock at the price of $52.05 per share. On October 1, 2004 and in connection with the vesting on September 30, 2004 of certain restricted stock awards, the Company purchased 2,737 shares from Ms. Tatlock, among others, at the price of $55.55 per share. The price per share paid by the Company for each purchase was the average of the high and low price of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the vesting date.

EXHIBIT 99.1 ------------ MEDIA RELEASE [LOGO OMITTED] Franklin Templeton Investments Corp. (Canada) announcement Toronto, March 3, 2005 -- Franklin Templeton Investments Corp. (FTIC-Canada) today announced that a panel of the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) has approved FTIC-Canada's agreement with the Staff of the OSC resolving the issues resulting from the OSC's investigation concerning frequent trading market timing activity. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, FTIC-Canada will pay C$49.1 million to be distributed to investors in certain funds managed by FTIC-Canada that experienced frequent trading market timing activities between February 1999 and February 2003. The OSC Staff stated they found no evidence of late trading occurring in funds managed by FTIC-Canada. Nor did they find any evidence of market timing by any insiders of the company or any evidence of ongoing market timing activity in funds managed by FTIC-Canada. The settlement monies will be distributed to investors who held the relevant funds during the time period outlined in the agreement in accordance with a plan to be developed by FTIC-Canada and overseen by an independent distribution consultant to be retained by the company. FTIC-Canada will submit the distribution plan to the OSC for approval by December 1, 2005. Once approved, FTIC-Canada will have three months to implement the plan. FTIC-Canada is one of a group of five companies to reach agreements with the OSC concerning frequent trading market timing activity. Franklin Templeton Investments Corp. (Canada) is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc., a global investment management organization operating as Franklin Templeton Investments. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Statements in this press release regarding Franklin Resources, Inc.'s business, which are not historical facts, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors, some of which are listed below, that could cause the actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
including, without limitation, the "Risk Factors" section of the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Franklin's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, and Franklin's most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q. * Governmental investigations, settlements of such investigations, ongoing and proposed governmental actions, and regulatory examinations of the company and its business activities as described in more detail in the company's press releases and regulatory filings as well as civil litigation arising out of or related to such matters could adversely impact our assets under management, increase costs and negatively impact the profitability of the company and future financial results. * Regulatory or legislative actions and reforms, particularly those specifically focused on the mutual fund industry, could adversely impact our assets under management, increase costs and negatively impact the profitability of the company and future financial results. * Volatility in the equity markets may cause the levels of our assets under management to fluctuate significantly. * Weak market conditions may lower our assets under management and reduce our revenues and income. * We face strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies. * Changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our revenues or hinder our growth. * We face risks associated with conducting operations in numerous foreign countries. * Certain of the portfolios we manage, including our emerging market portfolios and related revenues, are vulnerable to market-specific political or economic risks. * Our ability to meet cash needs depends upon certain factors, including our asset value, credit worthiness and the market value of our stock. * Technology and operating risk and limitations could constrain our operations. -30- For more information: Hugh Cameron, Franklin Templeton Investments Corp. 416 957-6099

MORNINGSTAR ratings and LIPPER rankings for Franklin Templeton U.S.-based funds are based on Class A shares, with the exception of LIPPER rankings for Mutual Series funds (less Mutual Recovery), which are based on Class Z shares. Class Z shares are offered to qualified investors only and have no sales charges nor Rule 12b-1 fees. Franklin Templeton funds are compared against a universe of all share classes. All Franklin Templeton Class A (Class Z) asset data is based on 3/31/05 figures unless noted otherwise. Indices are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in them. Unless otherwise noted, fund returns quoted reflect Class A shares. Performance returns, ratings and rankings for other classes may vary. 3. LIPPER calculates averages by taking all the funds and share classes in a peer group and averaging their total returns for the periods indicated. LIPPER tracks 143 peer groups of U.S. retail mutual funds, and the groups vary in size from 4 to 939 funds. LIPPER total return calculations include reinvested dividends and capital gains, but do not include sales charges or expense subsidization by the manager. Results may have been different if these or other factors had been considered. 4. Source: LIPPER(R) Inc., 3/31/05.

Source: LIPPER(R) Inc., 3/31/05. A LIPPER LEADERS DISTINCTION DOES NOT IMPLY THAT A FUND NAMED AS A LIPPER LEADER HAD THE BEST PERFORMANCE IN ITS CATEGORY. LIPPER Leaders Awards are based on Class A shares. LIPPER ratings for Consistent Return reflect funds' historical risk-adjusted returns, adjusted for volatility, relative to peers. LIPPER ratings for Total Return reflect funds' historical total return performance relative to peers. LIPPER ratings for Preservation reflect funds' historical loss avoidance relative to other funds within the same asset class. Preservation ratings are relative, rather than absolute, measures, and funds named LIPPER Leaders for Preservation may still experience losses periodically; those losses may be larger for equity and mixed equity funds than for fixed income funds. LIPPER ratings for Tax Efficiency reflect funds' historical success in postponing taxable distributions relative to peers. THE LIPPER RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE EVERY MONTH AND ARE BASED ON AN EQUAL-WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF PERCENTILE RANKS FOR THE CONSISTENT RETURN, TOTAL RETURN, PRESERVATION AND TAX-EFFICIENCY METRICS OVER THREE-, FIVE- AND 10-YEAR PERIODS (IF APPLICABLE). 20% of funds in each peer group are named LIPPER Leaders, the next 20% receive a score of 2, the middle 20% are scored 3, the next 20% are scored 4 and the lowest 20% are scored 5. Bracketed information represents the number of funds in each category. Not Available indicates that there were not enough funds in a category to constitute a class. FRANKLIN INCOME FUND, in LIPPER'S Income classification, received the following ratings for the three-, five- and 10-year periods respectively: Total Return: LIPPER Leader [128], LIPPER Leader [88], LIPPER Leader [23]; Preservation (in Mixed Equity asset class): 2 [975], LIPPER Leader [764], LIPPER Leader [334]; Consistent Return: LIPPER Leader [126], LIPPER Leader [88], 2 [17].

For each fund with at least a three-year history, MORNINGSTAR calculates a MORNINGSTAR Rating based on a MORNINGSTAR Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) THE OVERALL MORNINGSTAR RATING FOR A FUND IS DERIVED FROM A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE OF THE PERFORMANCE FIGURES ASSOCIATED WITH ITS THREE-, FIVE- AND 10-YEAR (IF APPLICABLE) MORNINGSTAR RATING METRICS. PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS. Morningstar Rating is for the A share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics. The following fund was rated against 238; 170; 62 Conservative Allocation funds for the respective three-, five- and 10-year periods ended 3/31/05, as applicable. For the three-, five- and 10-year periods ended 3/31/05, the MORNINGSTAR ratings were: FRANKLIN INCOME FUND 5, 5, 5.

The Five-Year Credit Agreement replaces Franklin's $210 million 364-Day revolving credit facility, which matured by its terms on June 2, 2005 and Franklin's $210 million five year revolving credit facility, which was terminated on June 10, 2005, prior to its scheduled expiration date of June 6, 2007. The Company desired to replace both the former 364-Day and five-year credit facilities with a single $420 million five-year credit facility. There were no amounts outstanding under either the former 364-Day or the five-year credit facilities on the respective dates of termination and no early termination penalties were incurred by Franklin. The Five-Year Credit Agreement provides for a $420 million revolving credit facility, of which the entire amount is currently undrawn and available. Under the Five-Year Credit Agreement, the Bank Parties are required to make revolving credit loans to Franklin and Franklin may borrow, repay and re-borrow such amounts from time to time until the maturity of the Five-Year Credit Agreement on June 10, 2010. Franklin may also, at its discretion, borrow amounts under bid loans, where the Bank Parties, at their discretion, can offer to bid on short term loans requested by Franklin based on a competitive auction procedure (the "Bid Loans"). Except for Bid Loans, prepayments and commitment reductions are permitted without premium or penalty upon proper notice and subject to a minimum dollar requirement. Loans under the Five-Year Credit Agreement shall bear interest, depending on the type of loan requested by Franklin, at a rate based on LIBOR plus a margin, at a rate based on an alternate base rate (as such term is defined in the Five-Year Credit Agreement) plus a margin, or an absolute or fixed rate to be determined at the time that Franklin requests a loan under the Five-Year Credit Agreement. The Five-Year Credit Agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type and substantially similar to the prior financing arrangements, including, among other things, limits on the incurrence of additional debts and liens, a minimum limit on the ratio of earnings to interest expense, a maximum limit on the ratio of debt in relation to liabilities and capital, and maintenance of a minimum level of working capital. The Five-Year Credit Agreement includes customary events of default for facilities of this type (with customary grace periods, as applicable) and provides that, upon the occurrence of an event of default, payment of all outstanding loans under the Five-Year Credit Agreement may be accelerated and/or the lenders' commitments may be terminated. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts payable under the Five-Year Credit Agreement automatically become immediately due and payable, and the lenders' commitments automatically terminate.
Some of the Bank Parties have or may have had various relationships with the Company and its affiliates involving the provision of a variety of financial services, including cash management, investment banking, and the issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees. In addition, the Company and certain affiliates have entered into interest rate and foreign exchange derivative arrangements with some of the financial institutions.

Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to subsection 9.6) be represented by one or more promissory notes in substantially such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns). 2.5 OPTIONAL TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS. The Borrower shall have the right, upon not less than five Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent, to terminate the Commitments or, from time to time, to reduce the amount of the Commitments, PROVIDED that no such reduction or termination shall be permitted if, after giving effect thereto, and to any prepayment of the Revolving Credit Loans made on the effective date therein, the - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21 then outstanding principal amount of Loans (including, without limitation, Bid Loans) would exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments as so reduced. Any such reduction shall be in an amount equal to $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and shall reduce permanently the Commitments then in effect. 2.6 OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS. Subject to subsection 2.17, the Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, prepay the Revolving Credit Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, upon at least four Business Days' irrevocable notice from the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, specifying the date and amount of prepayment and whether the prepayment is of LIBOR Loans, Alternate Base Rate Loans or a combination thereof, and, if of a combination thereof, the amount allocable to each. Upon receipt of any such notice from the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof. If any such notice is given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable by the Borrower on the date specified therein, together with accrued interest to such date on the amount prepaid. Partial prepayments shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple thereof and may only be made, if after giving effect thereto, subsection 2.9 shall not have been contravened. The Borrower shall not have the right to prepay the principal amount of any Bid Loan. 2.7 MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS. (a) Upon receipt by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of any Net Proceeds with respect to an Asset Disposition, (i) if such Net Proceeds exceed $10,000,000 or (ii) if such Net Proceeds do not exceed $10,000,000 but such Net Proceeds, together with all other Net Proceeds from other, prior Asset Dispositions in the same fiscal year of the Borrower, which, in each case, have not exceeded $10,000,000, exceed $25,000,000, then on the first Business Day after the receipt of Net Proceeds from such Asset Disposition, the Revolving Credit Loans shall be prepaid, without an accompanying reduction of the Commitments, in an amount equal to 100% of such Net Proceeds (or, in the case of Net Proceeds described in clause (ii) of this paragraph (a), if less, the amount by which such Net Proceeds, together with such other Net Proceeds, exceed $25,000,000). (b) In the event of any Change in Control, if the Majority Banks give the Borrower a notice within 30 days of the announcement of such Change in Control requiring the Borrower to prepay the Loans in full, then the Borrower shall prepay the Loans in full on a date determined by the Borrower and notified by the Borrower pursuant to the procedures of subsection 2.6 which is not more than 90 days after such Change in Control. If the Loans are required to be prepaid in full pursuant to this subsection 2.7(b), such Loans shall not be permitted to be reborrowed and the Commitments shall be deemed to be terminated as of the date of such prepayment. (c) If, after giving effect to any termination or reduction of any Commitments pursuant to subsection 2.5 or this subsection 2.7, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Loans exceeds the aggregate amount of such Commitments then in effect, the Borrower shall pay or prepay such Loans (including, without limitation, the Bid Loans) on the date of such termination or reduction in an aggregate principal amount at least equal to such excess, together with interest thereon accrued to the date of such payment or prepayment. All prepayments made pursuant to this subsection 2.7(c) shall be applied first to the Revolving Credit Loans until such Loans are paid in full and second to the Bid Loans. - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22 (d) Each prepayment of the Loans pursuant to this subsection 2.7 shall be accompanied by payment in full of all accrued interest thereon to and including the date of such prepayment, together with any additional amounts owing pursuant to subsection 2.17. 2.8 CONVERSION AND CONTINUATION OPTIONS. (a) The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert LIBOR Loans to Alternate Base Rate Loans, by giving the Administrative Agent at least two Business Days' prior irrevocable notice of such election, provided that any such conversion of LIBOR Loans may only be made on the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert Alternate Base Rate Loans to LIBOR Loans by giving the Administrative Agent at least three Working Days' prior irrevocable notice of such election. Any such notice of conversion to LIBOR Loans shall specify the length of the initial Interest Period or Interest Periods therefor. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof. All or any part of outstanding LIBOR Loans and Alternate Base Rate Loans may be converted as provided herein, provided that (i) any such conversion may only be made if, after giving effect thereto, subsection 2.9 shall not have been contravened and (ii) no Revolving Credit Loan may be converted into a LIBOR Loan after the date that is one month prior to the Termination Date. (b) Any LIBOR Loans may be continued as such upon the expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the Borrower giving notice to the Administrative Agent, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the term "Interest Period" set forth in subsection 1.1, of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such LIBOR Loans, PROVIDED that no LIBOR Loan may be continued as such (i) if, after giving effect thereto, subsection 2.9 would be contravened or (ii) after the date that is one month prior to the Termination Date and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if the Borrower shall fail to give any required notice as described above in this paragraph or if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the preceding proviso such Revolving Credit Loans shall be automatically converted to Alternate Base Rate Loans on the last day of such then expiring Interest Period. 2.9 MINIMUM AMOUNTS OF TRANCHES. All borrowings, conversions and continuations of Revolving Credit Loans hereunder and all selections of Interest Periods hereunder shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans comprising each Tranche shall be equal to $15,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. 2.10 INTEREST RATES AND PAYMENT DATES. (a) Each LIBOR Loan shall bear interest for each day during each Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR Adjusted Rate determined for such day plus the Applicable Margin. (b) Each Alternate Base Rate Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin. (c) Each Bid Loan shall bear interest as provided in subsection 2.3. (d) If all or a portion of the principal amount of any Revolving Credit Loan or any interest payable on the Loans shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23 acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum which is (x) in the case of overdue principal to the last day of any Interest Period then applicable thereto, the rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this subsection plus 2% or (y) otherwise, the rate described in paragraph (b) of this subsection plus 2%, in each case from the date of such non-payment until such amount is paid in full (as well after as before judgment). (e) Interest on each LIBOR Loan and Alternate Base Rate Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, provided in each case that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (d) of this subsection shall be payable on demand. 2.11 COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES. (a) Interest on Alternate Base Rate Loans, facility fees and utilization fees shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed, PROVIDED that interest on Alternate Base Rate Loans the rate of interest on which are based on the Prime Rate shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed. Interest on LIBOR Loans and Bid Loans shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the Banks of each determination of a LIBOR Adjusted Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the Alternate Base Rate or the LIBOR Reserve Requirements shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change in the Alternate Base Rate is announced or such change in the LIBOR Reserve Requirements becomes effective, as the case may be. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the Banks of the effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate. (b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Banks in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to subsection 2.10(a) and the calculations made by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to subsection 2.10(b). (c) If any Reference Bank's Commitment shall terminate or all its Loans shall be assigned for any reason whatsoever, such Reference Bank shall thereupon cease to be a Reference Bank, and if, as a result of the foregoing, there shall only be one Reference Bank remaining, the Administrative Agent (after consultation with the Borrower and the Banks) shall, by notice to the Borrower and the Banks, designate another Bank as a Reference Bank so that there shall at all times be at least two Reference Banks. (d) Each Reference Bank shall use its best efforts to furnish quotations of rates to the Administrative Agent as contemplated hereby. If any of the Reference Banks shall be unable or shall otherwise fail to supply such rates to the Administrative Agent upon its request, the rate of interest shall, subject to the provisions of subsection 2.12, be determined on the basis of the quotations of the remaining Reference Banks or Reference Bank. - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
24 2.12 INABILITY TO DETERMINE INTEREST RATE. In the event that prior to the first day of any Interest Period: (a) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBOR Adjusted Rate for such Interest Period, or (b) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Majority Banks that the LIBOR Adjusted Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks (as conclusively certified by such Banks) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall give telex, telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the Borrower and the Banks as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given (x) any LIBOR Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as Alternate Base Rate Loans, (y) any Revolving Credit Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to LIBOR Loans shall be converted to or continued as Alternate Base Rate Loans and (z) any outstanding LIBOR Loans shall be converted, on the first day of such Interest Period, to Alternate Base Rate Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further LIBOR Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert Alternate Base Rate Loans to LIBOR Loans. 2.13 PRO RATA TREATMENT AND PAYMENTS. Each borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans by the Borrower from the Banks hereunder, each payment by the Borrower of any facility, utilization or other fee hereunder, and any reduction of the Commitments of the Banks shall be made pro rata according to the respective Commitment Percentages of the Banks. Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the Revolving Credit Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Revolving Credit Loans then held by the Banks. All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower hereunder and under the Notes, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without set off or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the appropriate Banks, at the Administrative Agent's office specified in subsection 9.2, in Dollars and in immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to such Banks promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the LIBOR Loans or LIBOR Bid Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. If any payment on a LIBOR Loan or LIBOR Bid Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Working Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Working Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Working Day. 2.14 ILLEGALITY. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof shall make it unlawful for - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
25 any Bank or Lending Office to make or maintain LIBOR Loans as contemplated by this Agreement, (a) the commitment of such Bank hereunder to make LIBOR Loans, continue LIBOR Loans as such and convert Alternate Base Rate Loans to LIBOR Loans shall forthwith be cancelled and (b) the Loans of such Bank or Lending Office then outstanding as LIBOR Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to Alternate Base Rate Loans on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to such Loans or within such earlier period as required by law. If any such conversion of a LIBOR Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to subsection 2.17. 2.15 REQUIREMENTS OF LAW. (a) In the event that any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Bank with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law but, if not having the force of law, generally applicable to and complied with by banks of the same general type as such Bank in the relevant jurisdiction) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the Effective Date: (i) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Bank or Lending Office which is not otherwise included in the determination of the LIBOR Adjusted Rate hereunder; or (ii) shall impose on such Bank or Lending Office any other condition; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank or Lending Office, by an amount which such Bank deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining LIBOR Loans or Bid Loans or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Bank or Lending Office, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable. If any Bank or any Lending Office becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this subsection, it shall promptly notify the Borrower, through the Administrative Agent, of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this subsection submitted by such Bank or Lending Office, through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower shall be PRIMA FACIE evidence of the accuracy of the information so recorded. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder for one year. (b) If, after the date of this Agreement, the introduction of any applicable law, rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, affects the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by any Bank or any corporation controlling any Bank, and such Bank or such corporation (taking into consideration such Bank's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) determines that the amount of capital maintained by such Bank or such corporation which is attributable to or based upon the Loans, the Commitments or this - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
26 Agreement must be increased as a consequence of such introduction or change, then, upon demand of the Administrative Agent at the request of such Bank, the Borrower shall immediately pay to the Administrative Agent on behalf of such Bank, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank or such corporation for the increased costs to such Bank or corporation of such increased capital. Any such demand shall be accompanied by a certificate of such Bank setting forth in reasonable detail the computation of any such increased costs. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder for one year. (c) Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower, through the Administrative Agent, of any event of which it has knowledge that will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to subsection 2.15(a) or (b) above. No failure by any Bank to give (or delay in giving) such notice shall adversely affect such Bank's rights to such compensation, except that the Borrower shall have no obligation to compensate any Bank for any cost or reduction incurred or accrued by it more than one year before such Bank gives notice of the event giving rise to such cost or reduction as required by the preceding sentence. 2.16 TAXES. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any Note shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; PROVIDED that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this subsection) the Administrative Agent or Bank receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent or such Bank, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
27 (e) Each Foreign Bank hereby agrees that it shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower: (i) two copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8-BEN or Form W-8-ECI (or appropriate successor form), properly completed and duly executed by such Foreign Bank claiming complete exemption from U.S. Federal withholding tax on payments by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (ii) any other documentation as may be required under applicable U.S. tax law and regulations to evidence complete exemption from U.S. Federal withholding tax on all payments by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the Loan Documents. Such forms and other documentation shall be delivered by each Foreign Bank on or before the Initial Date (as defined below) and on or before the date, if any, such Foreign Bank changes its applicable Lending Office by designating a different Lending Office or selecting an additional office. In addition, each Foreign Bank shall deliver appropriate replacements to such forms previously delivered by it promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form or other documentation previously delivered by such Foreign Bank unless an event beyond the control of such Foreign Bank (including, without limitation, any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Foreign Bank from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Foreign Bank so advises the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. (f) For purposes of subsection (e), the term "Initial Date" shall mean (i) with respect to each Foreign Bank that is a party hereto on the date hereof, the date hereof, (ii) with respect to each Participant, the effective date of the grant of a participation to such Participant, and (ii) with respect to each transferee, the date of such transfer or assignment of an interest hereunder to such transferee. 2.17 INDEMNITY. The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Bank and to hold each Bank harmless from any loss or expense which such Bank may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in payment when due of the principal amount of or interest on any LIBOR Loan or Bid Loan, (b) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Bid Loans or LIBOR Loans after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement (and, in the case of Bid Loans, so long as the Borrower has accepted a Bid Loan offered in connection with any such notice), (c) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (d) the making by the Borrower of a prepayment of LIBOR Loans or (without prejudice to the last sentence of subsection 2.3(c)) Bid Loans on a day which is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto, including, without limitation, in each case, any such loss or expense arising from the reemployment of funds obtained by it or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder for one year. - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
28 2.18 FACILITY AND UTILIZATION FEES. (a) During the Commitment Period, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank a facility fee equal to the product of (i) 0.065% per annum at any time the Applicable Margin is based on Rating 1, (ii) 0.075% per annum at any time the Applicable Margin is based on Rating 2, (iii) 0.090% per annum at any time the Applicable Margin is based on Rating 3, (iv) 0.100% at any time the Applicable Margin is based on Rating 4 or (v) 0.125% at any time the Applicable Margin is based on Rating 5, and the average Commitment of such Bank (without regard to the principal amount of Loans from time to time made by such Bank) during the quarter in which the facility fee is paid. Such facility fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December, commencing June 30, 2005 and on the Termination Date (or, in any case, any earlier date on which all amounts outstanding hereunder shall become due and payable by acceleration or otherwise). (b) During the Commitment Period, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank a utilization fee computed at the rate of 0.05% per annum on the aggregate average amount of the Revolving Credit Loans under this Agreement outstanding during the quarter for which such fee is to be paid; PROVIDED, that no such fee shall be required to be paid with respect to any quarter in which the aggregate average amount of the Revolving Credit Loans and Bid Loans then outstanding under this Agreement does not exceed 50% of the aggregate Commitments of the Banks under this Agreement. Such utilization fee, to the extent payable, shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December, commencing on June 30, 2005 and on the Termination Date (or, in any case, any earlier date on which all amounts outstanding hereunder shall become due and payable by acceleration or otherwise). Sample computations of the facility fee and the utilization fee are given in Schedule II hereto. 2.19 MITIGATION OF COSTS. (a) . If any Bank, by changing its Lending Office or taking any other reasonable action, so long as making such change or taking such other action is not, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, disadvantageous to it in any financial, regulatory or other respect, can mitigate any adverse effect on the Borrower under subsections 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, such Bank shall take such action. SECTION 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES To induce the Banks to enter into this Agreement, and to make the Loans the Borrower hereby represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and each Bank that: 3.1 FINANCIAL CONDITION. (a) The consolidated balance sheets of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at September 30, 2003, and September 30, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income and of cash flows for the fiscal year ended on such date, reported on by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, copies of which have heretofore been furnished to each Bank, present fairly the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at such dates, and the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the fiscal year then ended. The unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at March 31, 2005 and the related - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
29 unaudited consolidated statements of income and of cash flows for the six-month period ended on such date, certified to the best of their knowledge by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower, copies of which have heretofore been furnished to each Bank, present fairly the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at such date, and the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the six-month period then ended (subject to normal year-end audit adjustments). All such financial statements, including the related schedules and notes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently throughout the periods involved (except as approved by such accountants or Responsible Officer, as the case may be, and as disclosed therein). Neither the Borrower nor any of its consolidated Subsidiaries had, at the date of the most recent balance sheet referred to above, any material Guarantee Obligation, contingent liability or liability for taxes, or any long-term lease or unusual forward or long-term commitment, including, without limitation, any interest rate or foreign currency swap or exchange transaction, which is not reflected in the foregoing statements or in the notes thereto and which is material in relation to the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries at such date. During the period from March 31, 2005 to and including the Closing Date there has been no sale, transfer or other disposition by the Borrower or any of its consolidated Subsidiaries of any material part of its business or property and no purchase or other acquisition of any business or property (including any capital stock of any other Person) material in relation to the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries at March 31, 2005. 3.2 NO CHANGE. Since March 31, 2005 there has been no Material Adverse Effect. 3.3 CORPORATE EXISTENCE; COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has the corporate power and authority, and the legal right, to own and operate its property, to lease the property it operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it is currently engaged and in which it proposes to be engaged after the Closing Date, (c) is duly qualified as a foreign corporation and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification and (d) is in compliance with all Requirements of Law except to the extent that the failure to comply therewith could not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 3.4 CORPORATE POWER; AUTHORIZATION; ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS. The Borrower has the corporate power and authority, and the legal right, to make, deliver and perform the Loan Documents and to borrow hereunder and has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize (i) the borrowings on the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Notes and (ii) the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents. Except as set forth on Schedule III hereto, no consent or authorization of, filing with or other act by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required in connection with the borrowings hereunder or with the execution, delivery, performance, validity or enforceability of this Agreement or the Notes. This Agreement has been, and each of the Notes will be, duly executed and delivered. This Agreement constitutes, and each of the Notes when executed and delivered will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
30 bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at law). 3.5 NO LEGAL BAR. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Notes, the borrowings hereunder and the use of the proceeds thereof will not (a) violate, to the knowledge of the Borrower, any Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation of the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Funds, or (b) violate any Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation of the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Funds which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and will not result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of its or their respective properties or revenues pursuant to any such Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation. 3.6 NO MATERIAL LITIGATION. No litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened by or against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or against any of its or their respective properties or revenues or by or against any "affiliated person" of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, within the meaning of the Investment Company Act, (a) with respect to this Agreement or the Notes or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or (b) which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 3.7 OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTY; LIENS. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has good record and marketable title in fee simple to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all its real property, and good title to all its other property which is material to its business, and none of such property, and none of the investment advisory agreements to which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or any of the revenues thereunder, is subject to any Lien except as permitted by subsection 6.3. 3.8 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use, all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, technology, know-how and processes necessary for the conduct of its business as currently conducted except for those the failure to own or license which could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (the "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY"). To the knowledge of the Borrower, no claim which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect has been asserted and is pending by any Person challenging or questioning the use of any such Intellectual Property or the validity or effectiveness of any such Intellectual Property, nor does the Borrower know of any valid basis for any such claim. To the knowledge of the Borrower, the use of such Intellectual Property by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries does not infringe on the rights of any Person, except for such claims and infringements that, in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 3.9 TAXES. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has filed or caused to be filed all material tax returns which, to the knowledge of the Borrower, are required to be filed and has paid all taxes shown to be due and payable on said returns or on any assessments made against it or any of its property and all other taxes, fees or other charges imposed on it or any of its property by any Governmental Authority (other than any the amount or validity of which are currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No part of the proceeds of any Loans are intended to be or will be used for "purchasing" or "carrying" any "margin stock" within the respective meanings of each of the quoted terms under Regulations U and X, or for any purpose which violates the provisions of the Regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. If requested by any Bank or the Administrative Agent, the Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent and each Bank a statement to the foregoing effect in conformity with the requirements of FR Form U-1 referred to in said Regulation U. 3.11 ERISA. No Reportable Event has occurred during the five-year period prior to the date on which this representation is made or deemed made with respect to any Plan, and each Plan has complied in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code.

There are no Multiemployer Plans. Neither the Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has had a complete or partial withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan. The present value (determined using actuarial and other assumptions which are reasonable in respect of the benefits provided and the employees participating) of the liability of the Borrower and each Commonly Controlled Entity for post retirement benefits to be provided to their current and former employees under Plans which are welfare benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) does not, in the aggregate, exceed the assets under all such Plans allocable to such benefits by an amount in excess of $0. 3.12 INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT; OTHER REGULATIONS.

Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Banks by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Borrower which may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates. 8.7 INDEMNIFICATION.

The Administrative Agent, the Co-Syndication Agents, the Co-Documentation Agents and their respective Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower as though the Administrative Agent, the Co-Syndication Agents and the Co-Documentation Agents were not the Administrative Agent, the Co-Syndication Agents and the Co-Documentation Agents, respectively, hereunder. With respect to the Administrative Agent, the Co-Syndication Agents or the Co-Documentation Agents, such Loans made or renewed by the Administrative Agent, the Co-Syndication Agents or the Co-Documentation Agents, the Administrative Agent, the Co-Syndication Agents or the Co-Documentation Agents, as the case may be, shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, the Co-Syndication Agents or the Co-Documentation Agents, as the case may be, and the terms "Bank" and "Banks" shall include the Administrative Agent, the Co-Syndication Agents and the Co-Documentation Agents in their individual capacities. 8.9 SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement, then the Majority Banks shall appoint from among the Banks a successor administrative agent for the Banks, which successor administrative agent shall be approved by the Borrower, whereupon such successor administrative agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor administrative agent effective upon its appointment, and the former Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this subsection shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement. 8.10 CO-SYNDICATION AGENTS AND CO-DOCUMENTATION AGENTS. Without limiting any provision contained in this Section 8, none of the Banks identified in this Agreement as the Co-Syndication Agents or the Co-Documentation Agents shall have, except as and to the limited extent expressly provided herein, any obligation, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Banks as such.

Any such waiver and any such amendment, supplement or modification shall apply equally to each of the Banks and shall be binding upon the Borrower, the Banks and the Administrative Agent. In the case of any waiver, the Borrower, the Banks and the Administrative Agent shall be restored to their former position and rights hereunder, and any Default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent thereon. 9.2 NOTICES.

(b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Bank may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (any such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of: (A) the Borrower, PROVIDED that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment to an assignee that is a Bank immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment, an Affiliate of a Bank, an Approved Fund (as defined below) or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee; and (B) the Administrative Agent, PROVIDED that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment to an assignee that is a Bank immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment.. (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions: (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Bank or an Affiliate of a Bank or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Bank's Commitment, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Bank subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, PROVIDED that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, PROVIDED that this clause shall not apply to rights in respect of outstanding Bid Loans; - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
53 (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; and (D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Bank prior to such assignment, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. For the purposes of this subsection 9.6, the term "Approved Fund" has the following meaning: "APPROVED FUND" means (a) a CLO and (b) with respect to any Bank that is a fund which invests in bank loans and similar extensions of credit, any other fund that invests in bank loans and similar extensions of credit and is managed by the same investment advisor as such Bank or by an Affiliate of such investment advisor. (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this subsection, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Bank under this Agreement, and the assigning Bank thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Bank shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of subsections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.5). Any assignment or transfer by a Bank of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection 9.6 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Bank of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section. (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Bank pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of demonstrable error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Banks may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Bank hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Bank, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Bank and an assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Bank hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall promptly accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
54 therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph. (c) (i) Any Bank may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "PARTICIPANT") in all or a portion of such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); PROVIDED that (A) such Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Banks shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Bank sells such a participation shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; PROVIDED that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Bank will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in clause (a) or (b) of subsection 9.1 that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this subsection, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of subsections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a Bank and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of subsection 9.7(b) as though it were a Bank, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to subsection 9.7(a) as though it were a Bank. (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under subsection 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17 than the applicable Bank would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. Subject to the preceding sentence, a Participant that would be a Foreign Bank if it were a Bank shall not be entitled to the benefits of subsection 2.16 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with subsection 2.16(e) as though it were a Bank and for purposes of claiming any benefit under subsection 2.16, any reference to a Foreign Bank shall be deemed to refer to such Participant. (d) Any Bank may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including any Note) to secure obligations of such Bank, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; PROVIDED that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Bank from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Bank as a party hereto. 9.7 ADJUSTMENTS; SET-OFF. (a) If any Bank (a "BENEFITTED BANK") shall at any time receive any payment of all or part of its Loans, or interest thereon, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in subsection 7(g), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other Bank, if any, in respect of such other Bank's Loans, or interest thereon, such Benefitted Bank shall purchase for cash from the - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
55 other Banks such portion of each such other Bank's Loans, or shall provide such other Banks with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such Benefitted Bank to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the Banks; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such Benefitted Bank, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. The Borrower agrees that each Bank so purchasing a portion of another Bank's Loan may exercise all rights of payment (including, without limitation, rights of set-off) with respect to such portion as fully as if such Bank were the direct holder of such portion. (b) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Banks provided by law, each Bank shall have the right, exercisable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and acceleration of the obligations of the Borrower owing in connection with this Agreement, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, to set-off and appropriate and apply against any such obligations any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Bank or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower (except for any such deposits, credits, indebtedness or claims held in any accounts maintained at any Bank as to which such Bank has waived its right of set-off). Each Bank agrees promptly to notify the Borrower, and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Bank, PROVIDED that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. 9.8 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. 9.9 SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. 9.10 INTEGRATION.

(d) On June 23, 2005, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Franklin Resources, Inc.

The holders of a majority of the shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at a meeting of the stockholders shall constitute a quorum thereat for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by statute, by the Certificate of Incorporation ("Certificate") or by these By-Laws.

actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify against any amount paid in settlement unless the Corporation has consented to such settlement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement or conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that such person had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.1, a person shall not be entitled, as a matter of right, to indemnification pursuant to this Section 4.1 against costs or expenses incurred in connection with any action, suit or proceeding commenced by such person against any person who is or was a director, officer, fiduciary, employee or agent of the Corporation or a Subsidiary Officer of any Affiliated Entity, but such indemnification may be provided by the Corporation in a specific case as permitted by Section 4.6 of this Article. Section 4.2 INDEMNIFICATION RESPECTING DERIVATIVE CLAIMS. The Corporation, to the full extent permitted, and in the manner required, by the laws of the State of Delaware as in effect at the time of the adoption of this Article or as such laws may be amended from time to time, shall indemnify any person who was or is made a party to or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit (including any appeal thereof) brought in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of, or to represent the interests of, the Corporation as a Subsidiary Officer of an Affiliated Entity against expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements) and costs actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless, and except to the extent that, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such judgment was rendered shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses and costs as the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper.

MORNINGSTAR ratings and LIPPER rankings for Franklin Templeton U.S. based funds are based on Class A shares, with the exception of LIPPER rankings for Mutual Series funds (other than Mutual Recovery), which are based on Class Z shares. Class Z shares are offered to qualified investors only and have no sales charges or Rule 12b-1 fees. Franklin Templeton funds are compared against a universe of all share classes. All Franklin Templeton Class A (Class Z) asset data is based on 5/31/05 figures unless noted otherwise. Indices are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in them. Unless otherwise noted, fund returns quoted reflect Class A shares. Performance returns, ratings and rankings for other classes may vary. 3. LIPPER calculates averages by taking all the funds and share classes in a peer group and averaging their total returns for the periods indicated. LIPPER tracks 143 peer groups of U.S. retail mutual funds, and the groups vary in size from 4 to 939 funds. LIPPER total return calculations include reinvested dividends and capital gains, but do not include sales charges or expense subsidization by the manager. Results may have been different if these or other factors had been considered. 4. Source: LIPPER(R) Inc., 6/30/05.

Source: LIPPER(R) Inc., 6/30/05. A LIPPER LEADER DISTINCTION DOES NOT IMPLY THAT A FUND NAMED AS A LIPPER LEADER HAD THE BEST PERFORMANCE IN ITS CATEGORY. LIPPER Leaders Awards are based on Class A shares. LIPPER ratings for Consistent Return reflect funds' historical risk-adjusted returns, adjusted for volatility, relative to peers. LIPPER ratings for Total Return reflect funds' historical total return performance relative to peers. LIPPER ratings for Preservation reflect funds' historical loss avoidance relative to other funds within the same asset class. Preservation ratings are relative, rather than absolute, measures, and funds named LIPPER Leaders for Preservation may still experience losses periodically; those losses may be larger for equity and mixed equity funds than for fixed income funds. LIPPER ratings for Tax Efficiency reflect funds' historical success in postponing taxable distributions relative to peers. THE LIPPER RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE EVERY MONTH AND ARE BASED ON AN EQUAL-WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF PERCENTILE RANKS FOR THE CONSISTENT RETURN, TOTAL RETURN, PRESERVATION AND TAX-EFFICIENCY METRICS OVER THREE-, FIVE- AND 10-YEAR PERIODS (IF APPLICABLE). 20% of funds in each peer group are named LIPPER Leaders, the next 20% receive a score of 2, the middle 20% are scored 3, the next 20% are scored 4 and the lowest 20% are scored 5. Bracketed information represents the number of funds in each category. Not Available indicates that there were not enough funds in a category to constitute a class. FRANKLIN INCOME FUND, in LIPPER'S Income classification, received the following ratings for the three-, five- and 10-year periods respectively: Total Return: LIPPER Leader [140], LIPPER Leader [93], LIPPER Leader [25]; Preservation (in Mixed Equity asset class): 2 [1008], LIPPER Leader [764], LIPPER Leader [335]; Consistent Return: LIPPER Leader [150], LIPPER Leader [93], 2 [19].

For each fund with at least a three-year history, MORNINGSTAR calculates a MORNINGSTAR Rating based on a MORNINGSTAR Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this -11-
scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) THE OVERALL MORNINGSTAR RATING FOR A FUND IS DERIVED FROM A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE OF THE PERFORMANCE FIGURES ASSOCIATED WITH ITS THREE-, FIVE- AND 10-YEAR (IF APPLICABLE) MORNINGSTAR RATING METRICS. PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS. MORNINGSTAR Rating is for the A share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics. The following fund was rated against 243; 163; 63 Conservative Allocation funds for the respective three-, five- and 10-year periods ended 6/30/05, as applicable.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Statements in this press release regarding Franklin Resources, Inc., which are not historical facts, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors, some of which are listed below, that could cause the actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, the "Risk Factors" section of the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Franklin's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, and Franklin's Form 10-Q filings. * Strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies with competing offerings and products could limit or reduce sales of our products, potentially resulting in a decline in our market share, revenues and net income. * Changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our revenues and hinder our growth. * The amount or mix of our assets under management are subject to significant fluctuations and could negatively impact our revenues and income. * Our increasing focus on international markets as a source of investments and sales of investment products subject us to increased exchange rate and other risks in connection with earnings and income generated overseas. * Poor investment performance of our products could affect our sales or reduce the level of assets under management, potentially negatively impacting our revenues and income. * We could suffer losses in earnings or revenue if our reputation is harmed. * Our future results are dependent upon maintaining an appropriate level of expenses, which are subject to fluctuation. * We face risks, and corresponding potential costs and expenses, associated with conducting operations and growing our business in numerous foreign countries. * Our ability to successfully integrate widely varied business lines can be impeded by systems and other technological limitations. * Any significant limitation or failure of our software applications and other technology systems that are critical to our operations could constrain our operations. * Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability. -12-
* Our ability to meet cash needs depends upon certain factors, including our asset value, credit worthiness and the market value of our stock. * Certain of the portfolios we manage, including our emerging market portfolios, are vulnerable to market-specific political, economic or other risks, any of which may negatively impact our revenues and income. * Our revenues, earnings and income could be adversely affected if the terms of our investment management agreements are significantly altered or these agreements are terminated by the funds we advise. * Diverse and strong competition limits the interest rates that we can charge on consumer loans. * We are subject to extensive regulation domestically and abroad. * Regulatory or legislative actions and reforms, particularly those specifically focused on the mutual fund industry, could adversely impact our assets under management, increase costs and negatively impact our profitability and future financial results. * Civil litigation arising out of or relating to recently settled governmental investigations or other matters as well as the legal risks associated with our business could adversely impact our assets under management, increase costs and negatively impact our profitability and/or our future financial results. * We depend on key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services. # # # -13-

As of August 31, 2005, Craig S. Tyle was appointed Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company"). Mr. Tyle is employed at-will and will receive an annual salary of $475,000 and a sign-on bonus of $675,000, which bonus is subject to reimbursement on a pro rata basis should Mr. Tyle terminate his employment within 12 months of his hire date. Mr. Tyle also will be eligible for a fiscal year-end bonus of $275,000 for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2005 and a guaranteed fiscal year-end bonus of $600,000 for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2006, provided Mr. Tyle continues to be employed by the Company and/or its subsidiaries. It is expected that 65% of Mr. Tyle's fiscal year-end bonuses will be paid in cash and 35% will be paid in securities. Additionally, relocation and moving expenses as well as up to six months of temporary housing costs for Mr. Tyle are to be reimbursed by the Company, provided that such relocation expenses are subject to reimbursement on a pro rata basis should Mr. Tyle terminate his employment within 12 months of his hire date. Subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, Mr. Tyle also is anticipated to receive a restricted stock award for shares of common stock of the Company valued at approximately $1.5 million, which such award shall vest in approximately three equal annual installments over the Company's three fiscal years beginning October 1, 2005. Mr. Tyle, like other employees, also will be eligible to participate in, among other things, the annual incentive compensation plan, universal stock incentive plan, employee stock investment plan, 401(k) plan and other health and welfare plans, programs and benefits, as they may exist from time to time. As a condition to Mr. Tyle's employment, Mr. Tyle entered into a standard form confidentiality agreement and he also executed standard form reimbursement agreements.
 
Separately, the Company and Mr. Tyle entered into an agreement (the "Agreement") pursuant to which the Company agreed, in the case of Mr. Tyle's "termination of employment" (as defined below), to pay Mr. Tyle as severance an amount equal to the sum of (a) his annual base salary as in effect immediately prior to his termination of employment and (b) an amount equal to 75% of the most recent annual bonus paid to him. Such severance payment will be made no later than 30 days following the date of Mr. Tyle's termination of employment. Additionally, under the Agreement, Mr. Tyle will continue to receive, during the period in which severance pay is being made, all standard fringe benefits generally accorded to employees of the Company, provided, however, that if contributions or benefits in employee retirement plans are not available in accordance with the provisions of any such employee retirement plan, then, in lieu thereof, the Company will pay Mr. Tyle an amount equivalent to what otherwise would have been provided under such plan. For purposes of the Agreement, termination of employment means a termination of Mr. Tyle's employment with the Company for any reason, other than (i) a voluntary termination by Mr. Tyle due to retirement or any other reason, (ii) termination by reason of death, (iii) termination by reason of physical or medical disability, or (iv) termination for "Cause", as defined in the Agreement. The Agreement, although dated as of June 1, 2005, became effective as of the first day of Mr. Tyle's employment with the Company and will remain in effect for a period of three years thereafter. This brief description of the Agreement is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

[NYSE:BEN] (the "Company") announced today that commencing October 1, 2005, the Company's Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2031 (Zero Coupon-Senior) (the "LYONs") will become eligible for conversion into shares of the Company's common stock, because the closing price of the Company's common stock exceeded the conversion trigger price of $78.34 for at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days in the quarter ending September 30, 2005. Holders may convert their LYONs into shares of the Company's common stock at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on December 31, 2005. Subject to the indenture, the LYONS may be eligible for conversion in subsequent fiscal quarters if, among other things, certain market price conditions are satisfied.
Pursuant to the terms of the indenture under which the LYONs were issued, the LYONs will be convertible at a rate of 9.3604 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of LYONs surrendered for conversion, subject to adjustment as provided in the indenture under which the LYONs were issued in May 2001. Cash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares. Upon conversion, a holder will not receive any cash payment representing accrued original issue discount.
If all outstanding LYONs were surrendered for conversion, the aggregate number of shares of common stock issued would be approximately 8,153,000. In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04-8, the dilutive effect of this potential issuance has already been reflected in the Company's diluted earnings per share reported in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2005.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
As of September 28, 2005, Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") and Samuel H. Armacost, a director of the Company, entered into an Indemnification Agreement. It is the Company's policy to enter into indemnification agreements ("Indemnification Agreements") with its directors, some of whom are also executive officers (each, an "Indemnified Person"). The Indemnification Agreements generally provide for (i) if requested by the Indemnified Person, the advancing of attorneys' fees and all other costs, expenses and obligations paid or incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in, or preparing to defend, be a witness in or participate in, any Claim ("Expenses") and (ii) indemnification of an Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted by law against any and all Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement of such Claim.
 
A "Claim" consists of participation in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, or any inquiry or investigation that the Indemnified Person in good faith believes might lead to the institution of any such action, suit or proceeding and must be related to the fact that the Indemnified Person is or was a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, trustee, agent or fiduciary for another corporation, partnership, join venture, employee benefit plan, trust or other enterprise.
 
Additionally, the Indemnification Agreements provide that if the Company pays an Indemnified Person pursuant to the Indemnification Agreements, the Company will be subrogated to the Indemnified Person's rights to recover from third parties.
 
However, the Indemnification Agreements prohibit such indemnification (i) in connection with any Claim initiated by the Indemnified Person against the Company or any director or officer of the Company unless the Company has joined in or consented to the Claim or (ii) if selected members of the Board of Directors or other person or body appointed by the Board of Directors determines that such indemnification is not permitted under applicable law. In the event of such determination, the Indemnified Person agrees to reimburse the Company for all amounts that the Company has advanced to the Indemnified Person in respect of such indemnification.
 
The Indemnification Agreements also provide that if there is a change in control of the Company, the Company will seek legal advice from special, independent counsel selected by the Indemnified Person and approved by the Company with respect to matters thereafter arising concerning rights of the Indemnified Person under the Indemnification Agreement. Additionally, the Indemnification Agreements provide that if there is a potential change in control, the Company will, upon written request of the Indemnified Person, fund a trust to satisfy expenses reasonably anticipated to be incurred in connection with a Claim relating to an indemnifiable event.
 
This brief description of the Indemnification Agreements is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form of Indemnification Agreements, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 10.1
 
INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT
 
THIS INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made as of this __ day of _____, 200_ by and between Franklin Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company" or "Indemnitor"), and (the "Indemnitee").
 
WITNESSETH:
 
WHEREAS, it is essential to the Company to retain and attract as directors and officers the most capable persons available;
 
WHEREAS, Indemnitee is a director or officer of the Company;
 
WHEREAS, both the Company and Indemnitee recognize the increased risk of litigation and other claims being asserted against directors and officers of public companies in today's environment;
 
WHEREAS, while basic protection against undue risk of personal liability of directors and officers heretofore has been provided through insurance coverage, such insurance may not provide adequate protection against such litigation and claims;
 
WHEREAS, the Certificate of Incorporation and by-laws of the Company, as amended, require the Company to indemnify its directors and officers as provided therein and Indemnitee has been serving and continues to serve as a director or officer of the Company in part in reliance on such Certificate of Incorporation and by-laws;
 
WHEREAS, in recognition of Indemnitee's need for substantial protection against personal liability in order to enhance Indemnitee's continued service to the Company in an effective manner, and Indemnitee's reliance on the aforesaid Certificate of Incorporation and by-laws, and in part to provide Indemnitee with specific contractual assurance that the protection specified in the Certificate of Incorporation and by-laws, as amended, will be available to Indemnitee (regardless of, among other things, any amendment to or revocation of such Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws, any change in the composition of the Company's Board of Directors or any acquisition transaction relating to the Company), the Company wishes to provide in this Agreement for the indemnification of and the advancing of expenses to Indemnitee to the full extent (whether partial or complete) permitted by law and as set forth in this Agreement, and, to the extent insurance is maintained, for the continued coverage of Indemnitee under the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policies;
 
 
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of Indemnitee continuing to serve the Company directly or, at its request, with another enterprise, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:
 
 
(a)
            
Change in Control
shall be deemed to have occurred if (i) any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Act")), other than a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or a corporation owned directly or indirectly by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company, is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 20% or more of the total voting power represented by the Company's then outstanding Voting Securities, except (A) a person who as of the date hereof owns 20% or more of the total voting power represented by the Company's outstanding Voting Securities (a "20% Group") shall not be deemed to have caused a change in control until such person becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the then outstanding Voting Securities, or (B) a person who becomes a beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 20% or more of the total voting power represented by the Company's then outstanding Voting Securities shall not be deemed to have caused a change in control unless such person also owns more of the total voting power represented by the Company's outstanding Voting Securities than is owned by a 20% Group at the time such person becomes owner of such securities, or (ii) during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board of Directors of the Company and any new director whose election by the Board of Directors or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof, or (iii) the stockholders of the Company approve a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the Voting Securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into Voting Securities of the surviving entity) at least 80% of the total voting power represented by the Voting Securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, or the stockholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets.
 
(b)
           
Claim
shall mean any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, or any inquiry or investigation, whether conducted by the Company or any other party, that Indemnitee in good faith believes might lead to the institution of any such action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other.
 
 
 
 
obligations paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to defend, be a witness in or participate in, any Claim relating to any Indemnifiable Event.
 
(d)
           
Indemnifiable Event
shall mean any event or occurrence related to the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, trustee, agent or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or other enterprise, or by reason of anything done or not done by Indemnitee in any such capacity.
 
(e)
            
Potential Change in Control
shall be deemed to have occurred if (i) the Company enters into an agreement, the consummation of which would result in the occurrence of a Change in Control, or (ii) any person (including the Company) publicly announces an intention to take or to consider taking actions which if consummated would constitute a Change in Control, or (iii) any person, other than a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company, who is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 9.5% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding Voting Securities, increases his beneficial ownership of such securities by 5% or more over the percentage so owned by such person on the date hereof, except (A) a 20% Group which increases its beneficial ownership of such securities by 5% or more over the percentage so owned on the date hereof shall not be deemed to have caused a potential change in control, unless such increase results in such person becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the then outstanding Voting Securities, or (B) a person who is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of the voting power representing 9.5% or more of the Company's Voting Securities and increases his beneficial ownership of such securities by 5% or more over the percentage so owned by such person on the date hereof shall not be deemed to have caused a potential change in control to have occurred unless, including such increase in ownership, such person owns more of the voting power represented by the Company's Voting Securities than is owned by a 20% Group at the time such person increases his ownership, or (iv) the Company's Board of Directors adopts a resolution to the effect that, for purposes of this Agreement, a Potential Change in Control has occurred.
 
(f)
            
Reviewing Party
shall mean any appropriate person or body consisting of a member or members of the Company's Board of Directors or any other person or body appointed by the Company's Board of Directors (including the special, independent counsel referred to in Section 3 hereof) who is not a party to the particular Claim for which Indemnitee is seeking indemnification.
 
(g)
           
Voting Securities
shall mean any securities of the Company which have rights to vote generally in the election of directors.
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a)
            
In the event Indemnitee was, is or becomes a party to or witness or other participant in, or is threatened to be made a party to or witness or other participant in, a Claim by reason of (or arising in part out of) an Indemnifiable Event, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law, as soon as practicable but in any event no later than thirty days after written demand is presented to the Company, against any and all Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement) of such Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Indemnitee shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement in connection with any Claim initiated by Indemnitee against the Company or any director or officer of the Company unless the Company has joined in or consented to the initiation of such Claim. If so requested by Indemnitee, the Company shall advance (within two business days of such request) any and all Expenses to Indemnitee (an "Expense Advance").
 
(b)
           
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the obligations of the Company under Section 2(a) shall be subject to the condition that the Reviewing Party shall not have determined (in a written opinion, in any case in which the special, independent counsel referred to in Section 3 hereof is involved) that Indemnitee would not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law, and (ii) the obligation of the Company to make an Expense Advance pursuant to Section 2(a) shall be subject to the condition that, if, when and to the extent that the Reviewing Party determines that Indemnitee would not be permitted to be so indemnified under applicable law, the Company shall be entitled to be reimbursed by Indemnitee (who hereby agrees to reimburse the Company) for all such amounts theretofore paid; provided, however, that if Indemnitee has commenced legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure a determination that Indemnitee should be indemnified under applicable law, any determination made by the Reviewing Party that Indemnitee would not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law shall not be binding and Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Company for any Expense Advance until the final judicial determination is made with respect thereto (as to which all rights of appeal therefrom have been exhausted or lapsed). If there has not been a Change in Control, the Reviewing Party shall be selected by the Board of Directors, and if there has been such a Change in Control, the Reviewing Party shall be the special, independent counsel referred to in Section 3 hereof. If there has been no determination by the Reviewing Party or if the Reviewing Party determines that Indemnitee substantively would not be permitted to be indemnified in whole or in part under applicable law, Indemnitee shall have the right to commence litigation in any court in the state of domicile or Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction thereof and in which venue is proper seeking an initial determination by the court or challenging any such determination by the Reviewing Party or any aspect thereof, and the Company hereby consents to service of process and to appear in any such proceeding. Any determination by the Reviewing Party otherwise shall be conclusive and binding on the Company and Indemnitee.
 
 
 
 
 
3.
              
Change in Control
. The Company agrees that, if there is a Change in Control of the Company (other than a Change in Control which has been approved by a majority of the Company's Board of Directors who were directors immediately prior to such Change in Control), then with respect to all matters thereafter arising concerning the rights of Indemnitee to indemnity payments and Expense Advances under this Agreement or any other agreement or the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws now or hereafter in effect relating to Claims for Indemnifiable Events, the Company shall seek legal advice only from special, independent counsel selected by Indemnitee and approved by the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), and who has not otherwise performed services for the Company within the last five years (other than in connection with such matters) or Indemnitee. Such counsel, among other things, shall render its written opinion to the Company and Indemnitee as to whether and to what extent Indemnitee would be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law. The Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees of the special, independent counsel referred to above and to fully indemnify such counsel against any and all expenses (including attorneys' fees), claims, liabilities and damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its engagement pursuant hereto.
 
4.
              
Establishment of Trust
. In the event of a Potential Change in Control, the Company shall, upon written request by Indemnitee, create a trust for the benefit of Indemnitee (the "Trust") and from time to time upon written request of Indemnitee shall fund the Trust in an amount sufficient to satisfy any and all Expenses reasonably anticipated at the time of each such request to be incurred in connection with investigating, preparing for and defending any Claim relating to an Indemnifiable Event, and any and all judgments, fines, penalties and settlement amounts of any and all Claims relating to an Indemnifiable Event from time to time actually paid or claimed, reasonably anticipated or proposed to be paid. The amount or amounts to be deposited in the Trust pursuant to the foregoing funding obligation shall be determined by the Reviewing Party, in any case in which the special, independent counsel referred to above is involved. The terms of the Trust shall provide that upon a Change in Control (i) the trustee to the Trust (the "Trustee") shall advance, within two business days of a request by Indemnitee, any and all Expenses to Indemnitee (and Indemnitee hereby agrees to reimburse the Trust under the circumstances under which Indemnitee would be required to reimburse the Company under Section 2(b) of this Agreement), (ii) the Trust shall continue to be funded by the Company in accordance with the funding obligation set forth above, (iii) the Trustee shall promptly pay to Indemnitee all amounts for which Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, and (iv) all unexpended funds in such Trust shall revert to the Company upon a final determination by the Reviewing Party or a court of competent jurisdiction, as the case may be, that Indemnitee has been fully indemnified under the terms of the Agreement, or that it is no longer anticipated that expenses will be incurred or amounts will be paid in connection with the Indemnifiable Event. The Trustee shall be chosen by Indemnitee. Nothing in this Section 4 shall relieve the Company of any of its obligations under this Agreement.
 
5.
              
Indemnification for Additional Expenses
. The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all expenses (including attorneys' fees) and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall (within two business days of such request) advance such expenses to Indemnitee, which are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any claim asserted against or
 
 
 
action brought by Indemnitee for (i) indemnification or advance payment of Expenses by the Company under this Agreement or any other agreement or the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws now or hereafter in effect relating to Claims for Indemnifiable Events and/or (ii) recovery under any directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the Company, regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to such indemnification, expense payment or insurance recovery, as the case may be.
 
6.
              
Partial Indemnity, Etc
. If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of the Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement of a Claim but not, however, for all of the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which Indemnitee is entitled. Moreover, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any or all Claims relating in whole or in part to an Indemnifiable Event or in defense of any issue or matter therein, including dismissal without prejudice, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses incurred in connection therewith. In connection with any determination by the Reviewing Party or otherwise as to whether Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified hereunder the burden of proof shall be on the Company to establish that Indemnitee is not so entitled.
 
7.
              
No Presumption
. For purposes of this Agreement, the termination of any claim, action, suit or proceeding, by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval) or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet any particular standard of conduct or have any particular belief or that a court has determined that indemnification is not permitted by applicable law.
 
8.
              
Non-Exclusivity, Etc
. The rights of Indemnitee hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights Indemnitee may have under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, by-laws or the Delaware General Corporation Law or otherwise. To the extent that a change in the Delaware General Corporation Law (whether by statute or judicial decision) permits greater indemnification by agreement than would be afforded currently under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, by-laws and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change.
 
9.
              
Liability Insurance
. To the extent the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies providing directors' and officers' liability insurance, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies, in accordance with its or their terms, to the maximum extent of the coverage provided under such policy or policies in effect for any other Company director or officer.
 
10.
           
Amendments, Etc
. No supplement, modification or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by both of the parties hereto. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or not similar) nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver.
 
 
 
 
subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the Company effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.
 
12.
           
No Duplication of Payments
. The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment in connection with any claim made against Indemnitee to the extent Indemnitee has otherwise actually received payment (under any insurance policy, Certificate of Incorporation, by-law or otherwise) of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.
 
13.
           
Binding Effect, Etc
. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, including any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company, spouses, heirs, and personal and legal representatives. This Agreement shall continue in effect regardless of whether Indemnitee continues to serve as an officer or director of the Company or in any capacity of any other enterprise at the Company's request.
 
14.
           
Severability
. The provisions of this Agreement shall be severable in the event that any of the provisions hereof (including any provision within a single section, paragraph or sentence) are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable, and the remaining provisions shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.
 
15.
           
Governing Law
. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and to be performed in such state without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date set forth above.

(d)  On October 11, 2005, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") elected Mr. Joseph R. Hardiman to fill one newly created vacancy on the Board resulting from the Board's increase in the authorized number of directors of the Company from twelve (12) directors to thirteen (13) directors, as described in Item 5.03 below. Mr. Hardiman is not, and has not been, an employee of the Company. The Board affirmatively determined that Mr. Hardiman was "independent" under the Company's Director Independence Standards, as amended, and the independence requirements for directors pursuant to both the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual and the rules for listed companies on the Pacific Exchange, Inc.

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement or conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that such person had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.1, a person shall not be entitled, as a matter of right, to indemnification pursuant to this Section 4.1 against costs or expenses incurred in connection with any action, suit or proceeding commenced by such person against any person who is or was a director, officer, fiduciary, employee or agent of the Corporation or a Subsidiary Officer of any Affiliated Entity, but such indemnification may be provided by the Corporation in a specific case as permitted by Section 4.6 of this Article.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.2, a person shall not be entitled, as a matter of right, to indemnification pursuant to this Section 4.2 against costs and expenses incurred in connection with any action or suit in the right of the Corporation commenced by such person, but such indemnification may be provided by the Corporation in any specific case as permitted by Section 4.6 of this Article.

However, distributions to Mr. Woodworth under the Agreement may be accelerated or delayed in accordance with the specific terms of the Agreement and as permitted under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder. Mr. Woodworth may elect, at any time, to change his distribution schedule (in conformance with Section 409A(a)(4)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder), provided that such election shall not take effect for one (1) year from the date of the new election and that under the amended payment schedule, each distribution installment shall occur no earlier than five (5) years after such installment would have been paid under the prior distribution schedule.

3.1
       
Deferral Election
. The Participant agrees to defer under this Agreement all of his Director's fees (including meeting fees, committee fees, chairperson fees as well as all other fees) and annual or other stock grants (relating to his service as a Director of Franklin Resources) earned through December 31, 2005. No Director fees or stock grants earned after December 31, 2005 will be deferred under this Agreement.
3.2
       
Contributions
. All contributions made to fund benefits under the Agreement shall be paid by the Company; no direct contributions by the Participant are required or permitted.
3.3
       
Investment Elections
. In accordance with rules, procedures and options established by the Committee, the Participant shall have the right to direct the investment of his or her Deferred Compensation Account. The Participant may direct that his or her Deferred Compensation Account be invested in shares of Common Stock and/or one or more Franklin Templeton mutual funds as selected by the Participant; provided, however, that the Committee shall have the authority, in its sole discretion, with or without notice, to change or eliminate one or more of the foregoing investment alternatives available to the Participant at any time. The Participant shall direct the investment of his or her Deferred Compensation Account by submitting to the Company an Investment Direction in the form set forth at
Exhibit B
. In accordance with procedures established by the Committee, the Participant may change his or her investment directions effective as of the first day of any calendar quarter. Such changes may be made on a validly submitted Investment Direction in the form set forth at

no fewer than 15 days preceding the effective date of the change. If the Participant fails to provide any investment directions at a time when the Participant has a positive balance in the Deferred Compensation Account, the Company or the Committee shall deem the entire Deferred Compensation Account invested in shares of Company Common Stock. The Company may invest assets allocable to the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account in any manner, in any amount and for any period of time which the Company in its sole discretion may select;
 
_________________________
(II) Limitation on distributions. The requirement of subparagraph (A)(vi) is met only if, as determined under regulations of the Secretary, the amounts distributed with respect to an emergency do not exceed the amounts necessary to satisfy such emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which such hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the participant's assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship).

but the Company must credit or charge the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account with the same earnings, gains or losses that the Participant would have incurred if the Company had invested the assets allocable to the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account in the specific investments, in the specific amounts and for the specific periods directed by the Participant. If this Agreement is determined to be subject to the fiduciary provisions of Part 4 of Title I of ERISA, this Agreement shall be treated as a plan described in Section 404(c) of ERISA and Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Section 2550.404c-1, in which plan fiduciaries may be relieved of liability for any losses which are the direct and necessary result of investment instructions given by the Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary.
3.4
       
Investment Earnings or Losses
. Any amounts credited to the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account may increase or decrease as a result of the Company's investment of such amounts, as described in Section 3.3 above.

The Participant and the Participant's Beneficiary understand and agree that they assume all risk in connection with any decrease in the value of the Deferred Compensation Account as invested in accordance with these Sections 3.3 and 3.4.
3.5
       
Contribution of Notional Distributions
. The Deferred Compensation Account shall be credited with notional dividends and other distributions at the same time, in the same form, and in equivalent amounts as dividends and other distributions that are payable from time to time with respect to investments selected by the Participant under the Deferred Compensation Account. Any such notional dividends and other distributions shall be valued as of the date on which they are credited to the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account and reallocated to acquire additional shares of the investments selected by the Participant under the Deferred Compensation Account. If such notional dividends and other distributions are credited in a form other than Common Stock or cash, the Committee will determine their value in good faith.

distribution will not cause such violation, or such violation will not cause material harm to the Company.

(a) On October 21, 2005, Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") sent a notice to participants in its Franklin Templeton Profit Sharing 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan") informing them that, due to a change in recordkeeper and enhancements to be implemented with regard to the 401(k) Plan, participants in the 401(k) Plan will not be able (i) to direct or diversify the assets held in their 401(k) Plan accounts, (ii) to make changes to salary deferral investment elections and (iii) to request a loan, distribution or in-service withdrawal, during a period that will begin on November 21, 2005 and is expected to end during the week of December 12, 2005. This period is referred to as the "Blackout Period".
 
A participant in the 401(k) Plan, a security holder or other interested person may obtain, without charge, information regarding the Blackout Period, including the actual ending date of the Blackout Period, by contacting Penelope S. Alexander, Vice President, Human Resources-U.S., at Franklin Resources, Inc., One Franklin Parkway, San Mateo, California 94403-1906, at (650) 312-3092, before and during the Blackout Period, and the Office of the General Counsel, Franklin Resources, Inc., One Franklin Parkway, San Mateo, California 94403-1906, for a period of two years thereafter.
 
On October 24, 2005, the Company sent a notice (the "BTR Notice") to its directors and executive officers informing them that, because the restrictions during the Blackout Period include restrictions on investment changes involving the Company's common stock held in the 401(k) Plan, they would be prohibited during the Blackout Period, pursuant to Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Rule 104 of Regulation BTR promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, from purchasing and selling shares of the Company's common stock (including derivative securities pertaining to such shares) acquired in connection with their service as a director or employment as an executive officer.
 
A copy of the BTR Notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The Company provided such notice to its executive officers and directors within five (5) business days of October 21, 2005, which is the date the notices were mailed to participants in the 401(k) Plan and that the Company was notified of the Blackout Period.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This notice is to inform you of significant restrictions on your ability to trade in shares of the Company's stock during an upcoming "blackout period" that will apply to the Franklin Templeton Profit Sharing 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan"). This special "blackout period" is imposed on directors and executive officers of the Company by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation BTR (Blackout Trading Restriction) and is in addition to the Company's blackout periods related to our earnings releases.
The 401(k) Plan blackout period is being imposed because of the conversion to a new plan recordkeeper and enhancements to the 401(k) Plan. The 401(k) Plan blackout period will begin at 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time on November 21, 2005 and is expected to end during the week of December 12, 2005 (the "401(k) Plan Blackout Period"). The actual ending date of the 401(k) Plan Blackout Period will be communicated to you at a later time. During the 401(k) Blackout Period, participants in the 401(k) Plan will not be able (i) to direct or diversify the assets held in their 401(k) Plan accounts, (ii) to make changes to salary deferral investment elections and (iii) to request a loan, distribution or in-service withdrawal, including investment changes involving the Company's common stock held in the 401(k) Plan.
In accordance with Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Rule 104 of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation BTR, the Company's directors and executive officers are prohibited  during the 401(k) Plan Blackout Period  from purchasing, selling, or otherwise acquiring or transferring, directly or indirectly, any equity security of the Company acquired in connection with his or her services as a director or executive officer.
Please note the following:
 -  "Equity securities" is defined broadly to include the Company's common stock, options, and other derivatives.
 
1
 
 
 
 -  Covered transactions are not limited to those involving your direct ownership, but include any transaction in which you have a pecuniary interest (for example, transactions by your immediate family members living in your household).
 -  Among other things, these rules prohibit exercising options granted to you in connection with your services as a director or executive officer, selling Company stock acquired pursuant to such options, selling Company common stock originally received as a restricted stock grant or upon the vesting of a restricted stock unit, or selling shares to cover withholding taxes upon the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units.
 -  Exemptions from these rules generally apply for purchases or sales under Rule 10b5-1 plans, dividend reinvestment plans, sales required by law, and certain other "automatic" transactions.
 -  Although you are permitted to engage in transactions involving equity securities that were not acquired in connection with your services as a director or executive officer, there is a presumption that any such transactions are prohibited unless you can identify the source of the shares and show that you used the same identification for all related purposes, such as tax reporting and disclosure requirements.
These rules apply in addition to the trading restrictions under the Company's insider trading policy. If you engage in a transaction that violates these rules, you may be required to disgorge your profits from the transaction, and you may be subject to civil and criminal penalties.
Because of the complexity of these rules and the severity of the penalties and other remedies, please contact me (650-525-7188)
or
Craig Tyle (650-312-4161) before engaging in
any
transaction involving the Company's equity securities during the 401(k) Plan Blackout Period.
If you have any questions about the 401(k) Plan Blackout Period, its beginning or ending dates or the information in this notice, please feel free to contact me at 650-525-7188 or Craig Tyle at 650-312-4161, or either of us at One Franklin Parkway, San Mateo, California 94403-1906.

On September 22, 2005, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") approved an amendment and restatement of the Amended and Restated Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (the "AIP") principally to (a) provide that the allocation of actual amounts to the award pools under the AIP for a plan year and the determination and payment of actual incentive awards for a plan year may be made in advance of the completion of such plan year and (b) make various conforming and other technical changes to the AIP. The amendment and restatement of the AIP was not subject to the approval of the stockholders of the Company, nor was the amendment and restatement determined to be material to the Company. A copy of the AIP, as amended and restated on September 22, 2005, is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Restricted Fund Unit Awards
.
 
Pursuant to the terms of Section 5.1 of the AIP, incentive awards may be paid in cash or, among other things, in shares of investment companies in the Franklin Templeton Investments funds, subject to restrictions and vesting determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board to be appropriate. Accordingly, the Company has adopted standard forms of a Notice of Restricted Fund Unit Award and Restricted Fund Unit Award Agreement for awards to certain investment management personnel and, potentially, others, copies of which forms are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference ("Standard IM Award Documents"), and forms of a Notice of Restricted Fund Unit Award and Restricted Fund Unit Award Agreement in the case of awards made to certain other investment management personnel and, potentially, others, copies of which forms are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.3 and incorporated herein by reference ("Other IM Award Documents"). The forms of Other IM Award Documents differ from the forms of Standard IM Award Documents with regard to the timing of the vesting of restricted fund units credited as a result of dividends paid from time to time with respect to the shares of the applicable class of a series of an investment company in the Franklin Templeton Investments funds issuable for each restricted fund unit.
 
The following is a summary of the principal terms of the forms of Standard IM Award Documents and Other IM Award Documents, which are qualified in their entirety by reference to Exhibits 10.2 and 10.3, respectively:
 
The Company may issue to participants, including executive officers (hereinafter, each a "Participant"), restricted fund units ("Units") as set forth in the Notice of Restricted Fund Unit Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Participant as owner thereof as set forth in the Restricted Fund Unit Award Agreement.
 
Transfer Restrictions
. The Units may not be transferred by Participant in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Participant may designate a beneficiary of the Units in the event of Participant's death. The terms of the Restricted Fund Unit Award Agreement shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and transferees of Participant.
 
Vesting
. The Units shall become vested in accordance with the vesting schedule in the Notice of Restricted Fund Unit Award so long as Participant maintains a continuous status as an employee of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company. If Participant ceases to maintain a continuous status as an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries for any reason other than death or disability, all Units to the extent not
 
 
yet vested on the date Participant ceases to be an employee shall be forfeited by Participant. If Participant dies or in the event of termination of Participant's continuous status as an employee as a result of disability (as determined by the Board in accordance with the policies of the Company) while an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, the Units awarded shall become fully vested as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board, "disability" means that Participant ceases to be an employee on account of permanent and total disability as a result of which Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long-term disability policy.
 
In the event of a proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company or of a merger or corporate combination of the Company (a "Transaction") in which the successor entity does not agree to assume the award of restricted fund units or substitute an equivalent award, the Company shall make a determination as to the equitable treatment of the award and shall notify Participant of such treatment no later than ten (10) days prior to the consummation of such proposed Transaction. In the event the award is not assumed in connection with a Transaction, the award will terminate upon the consummation of such proposed Transaction.
 
Conversion Of Units And Issuance Of Fund Shares
. Upon each vesting date, the value of one share of the applicable class of a series of an investment company in the Franklin Templeton Investments funds ("fund") shall be issuable for each Unit that vests on such date (the "Shares"), subject to the terms and provisions of the AIP, the Notice of Restricted Fund Unit Award and the Restricted Fund Unit Award Agreement. Any fractional Unit that vests on a particular date shall be converted into the value of a fractional Share. Thereafter, the Company will transfer to a broker and/or dealer or equivalent entity authorized to effect transactions in such fund shares for the account of others (the "Broker/Dealer") in the jurisdiction of Participant's employment, or cause such Broker/Dealer to receive or otherwise credit, the aggregate vested value of such Shares for the benefit of such Participant. The Broker/Dealer will then cause the Shares to be acquired on behalf of Participant and, thereafter, the Broker/Dealer will transfer such Shares to Participant. Any Shares in a fund shall be advisor class shares or equivalent, if available; otherwise, they shall be Class A shares or equivalent or, if unavailable, the Company shall make a determination as to the class of Shares. Notwithstanding the above, the Company may, in its discretion, pay to Participant all or a portion of any vested Units in cash in an amount equal to the vested value of the Shares. The Shares or equivalent cash payment will be issued to Participant as soon as practicable after the vesting date, but in any event, within the period ending on the later to occur of the date that is two and a half (2) months from the end of (i) Participant's tax year that includes the applicable vesting date, or (ii) the Company's tax year that includes the applicable vesting date.
 
In the event any one or more of the funds ceases to exist, the shares of such fund represented by Units subject to the award shall be replaced with shares of a comparable fund in the Franklin Templeton Investments funds which preserves the compensation element of the award existing at the time the fund ceases to exist. The determination of fund comparability shall be made by the Compensation Committee of the Board and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive.
 
Right To Shares
. Participant shall not have any right in, to or with respect to any of the Shares (including any voting rights) issuable under the award until the award is settled by the issuance of such Shares to Participant.
 
Dividends
. Any dividends that are paid from time to time with respect to the Shares represented by the Units shall be deemed reinvested in the Shares with respect to which the dividend was paid and shall be credited to Participant as additional Units. Such additional Units shall vest in accordance with the terms of the applicable Standard IM Award Documents or Other IM Award Documents.
 
 
 
 
Updated Award Documents for Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Unit Awards
.
 
Under the Company's 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (the "2002 Plan"), the Company may make awards of restricted stock and/or restricted stock units (among other types of awards) to any key executive, employee or director of the Company or its subsidiaries (each a "Plan Participant"). The Company previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as exhibits to certain of its Form 8-Ks copies of its forms of Notice of Restricted Stock Award and Restricted Stock Award Agreement and Notice of Restricted Stock Unit Award and Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (collectively, "Award Documents"). The Company recently adopted updated forms of its Award Documents and, although the material terms of the Award Documents have not changed, copies of the updated Notice of Restricted Stock Award and Restricted Stock Award Agreement for awards in recognition of past efforts and contributions, Notice of Restricted Stock Award and Restricted Stock Award Agreement for inducement and/or performance awards, Notice of Restricted Stock Unit Award and Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement for awards in recognition of past efforts and contributions, and Notice of Restricted Stock Unit Award and Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement for inducement and/or performance awards are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.4, 10.5, 10.6 and 10.7, respectively (collectively, "Updated Award Documents"). The forms of Notice of Restricted Stock Award and Restricted Stock Award Agreement for awards in recognition of past efforts and contributions and for inducement and/or performance awards are substantially similar. Additionally, the forms of Notice of Restricted Stock Unit Award and Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement for awards in recognition of past efforts and contributions and for inducement and/or performance awards are substantially similar.
 
The following is a summary of the principal terms of the Updated Award Documents which are qualified in their entirety by reference to Exhibits 10.4, 10.5, 10.6 and 10.7, as applicable:
 
Restricted Stock Awards
.
 
The Company may issue to a Plan Participant shares of its common stock ("Stock") as set forth in the Notice of Restricted Stock Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Plan Participant as owner thereof as set forth in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement. All shares of Stock issued shall be deemed issued to Plan Participant as fully paid and non assessable shares, and, subject to the restrictions set forth in the 2002 Plan and the Restricted Stock Award Agreement, Plan Participant shall have all rights of a stockholder with respect thereto, including the right to vote, to receive dividends (including stock dividends), to participate in stock splits or other recapitalizations, and to exchange such shares in a tender offer, merger, consolidation or other reorganization.
 
Transfer Restrictions
. No Stock issued to Plan Participant shall be sold, transferred by gift, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise transferred or disposed of by Plan Participant prior to the date on which it becomes vested, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Plan Participant is not precluded, however, from exchanging the Stock awarded pursuant to a cash or stock tender offer, merger, reorganization or consolidation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any securities (including stock dividends and stock splits) received with respect to shares of Stock which are not yet vested shall be subject to the provisions of the Restricted Stock Award Agreement in the same manner and shall become fully vested at the same time as the Stock with respect to which such additional securities were issued.
 
Vesting
. Plan Participant's interest in the Stock awarded shall become vested and nonforfeitable in accordance with the vesting schedule in the Notice of Restricted Stock Award so long as Plan Participant maintains a continuous status as an employee (as such term is defined in the 2002 Plan) of the Company or
 
 
a subsidiary of the Company. If Plan Participant ceases to maintain a continuous status as an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries for any reason other than death or disability, all shares of Stock to the extent not yet vested on the date Plan Participant ceases to be an employee shall be forfeited by Plan Participant. If Plan Participant dies or in the event of termination of Plan Participant's continuous status as an employee as a result of disability (as determined by the Board in accordance with the policies of the Company) while an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, Plan Participant's interest in all shares of Stock awarded shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board, "disability" means that Plan Participant ceases to be an employee on account of permanent and total disability as a result of which Plan Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long-term disability policy.
 
Restricted Stock Unit Awards
.
 
The Company may issue to Plan Participant restricted stock units ("Stock Units") as set forth in the Notice of Restricted Stock Unit Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Plan Participant as owner thereof as set forth in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement.
 
Transfer Restrictions
. Stock Units may not be transferred by Plan Participant in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Plan Participant may designate a beneficiary of Stock Units in the event of Plan Participant's death. The terms of the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and transferees of Plan Participant.
 
Vesting
. Stock Units shall become vested in accordance with the vesting schedule in the Notice of Restricted Stock Unit Award so long as Plan Participant maintains a continuous status as an employee of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company. If Plan Participant ceases to maintain a continuous status as an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries for any reason other than death or disability, all Stock Units to the extent not yet vested on the date Plan Participant ceases to be an employee shall be forfeited by Plan Participant. If Plan Participant dies or in the event of termination of Plan Participant's continuous status as an employee as a result of disability (as determined by the Board in accordance with the policies of the Company) while an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, Stock Units awarded hereunder shall become fully vested as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board, "disability" means that Plan Participant ceases to be an employee on account of permanent and total disability as a result of which Plan Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long-term disability policy.
 
Conversion Of Units And Issuance Of Shares
. Upon each vesting date, one share of Stock shall be issuable for each Stock Unit that vests on such date, subject to the terms and provisions of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Restricted Stock Unit Award and the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement. Upon satisfaction of any required tax or other withholding obligations, the shares of Stock will be issued to Plan Participant as soon as practicable after the vesting date, but in any event, within the period ending on the later to occur of the date that is two and a half (2) months from the end of (i) Plan Participant's tax year that includes the applicable vesting date, or (ii) the Company's tax year that includes the applicable vesting date. Any fractional Stock Unit remaining after all Stock Units under the award are fully vested shall be discarded and shall not be converted into a fractional share of Stock. Notwithstanding the above, the Company may, in its discretion, pay to Plan Participant all or a portion of any vested Stock Units in cash in an amount equal to the shares of Stock, less any tax or other withholding obligations.
 
 
 
 
Right To Shares
. Plan Participant shall not have any right in, to or with respect to any of the shares of Stock (including any voting rights or rights with respect to dividends paid on the Stock) issuable for a Stock Unit until the award is settled by the issuance of such shares of Stock to Plan Participant.

IV. AWARD POOL FUNDING AND INDIVIDUAL AWARDS

(a)  Determine the percentage, not to exceed Twenty Percent (20%), if any, of PTOI that will be allocated to the Award Pool at various levels of Company performance measured by changes in PTOI from the prior year. The Committee may also determine if in its opinion prevailing circumstance dictates that the Award Pool for particular identified groups of Principals and/or Associates shall be based upon the PTOI of particular identified subsidiary or subsidiaries of the Company. The determinations made by the Committee shall be subject to approval of the Board of Directors of the Company.
 
 
 
 
(b)  Determine the allocation of the Award Pool of the Company and any identified subsidiary or subsidiaries of the Company as described in (a) above, between the Associates' Pool(s) and the Principals' Pool(s).

4.3  The actual amounts allocated to the Award Pool, the Associates' Pool(s) and/or the Principals' Pool(s) may be determined and/or revised at any time during or after the end of each Plan Year, based upon actual or projected Company performance and PTOI.
 
4.4  Actual Incentive Awards may be determined during or following the end of each Plan Year. The amount of any Incentive Awards determined and paid prior to the end of a Plan Year shall be credited against the Award Pool for such Plan Year so that the net amount remaining in the Award Pool is available for Incentive Awards determined and paid after after the end of such Plan Year. Actual Incentive Awards may vary from the Target Awards depending on the PTOI allocated or projected to be allocated to the Award Pool and a Participant's individual performance.
 
4.5  The Principals' Pool will be allocated among any or all Principals on the basis of a Participant's individual performance and based upon the accomplishment of such Participant's goals and objectives for the Plan Year. No Principals are guaranteed a payout from the Principals' Pool.
 
4.6  The Associates' Pool will be allocated among any or all Associates on the basis of a Participant's individual performance and based upon the accomplishment of such Participant's goals and objectives for the Plan Year. No Associates are guaranteed a payout from the Associates' Pool.
 
4.7  To promote the highest levels of individual performance, there is no minimum or maximum which applies to individual Incentive Awards of any Participant. Amounts not allocated as Incentive Awards do not carry over to the next Plan Year, and may be used for distribution as incentive compensation to employees who are not Participants in the Plan.
 
4.8  Notwithstanding a Participant's individual performance and anything to the contrary in this Plan, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, increase or decrease (even to zero) the Incentive Award payable to a Participant.
 
V. PAYMENT OF ANNUAL AWARDS
 
5.1  Incentive Awards may, in the Committee's discretion, be paid in the following time and manner:
 
 
 
 
(a)  Incentive Awards may be paid in cash or in a combination of cash and grants of Stock, Options, SARs, Stock Unit Awards, Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Unit Awards under the 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan or successor equity compensation plan, and shares of investment companies in the Franklin Templeton Investments funds, subject to restrictions and vesting determined by the Committee to be appropriate. Incentive Awards paid in Stock, Options, SARs, Stock Unit Awards, Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Unit Awards under the 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan or successor equity compensation plan shall also be subject to the limit on the maximum number of shares that may be issued under such plan and any additional limitations on the maximum number of shares that may be awarded to any individual in any fiscal or calendar year under such plan.
 
(b)  At least 25% of the Incentive Award will be paid in cash at such time during or after the end of the Plan Year as determined by the Committee. The balance (if any) of the cash portion of an Incentive Award shall be paid at such later time and in such manner as the Committee determines. Participants shall be notified in writing as to the date and time of payment of any such deferred portion of the Incentive Award.
 
(c)  Stock, Options, SARs, Stock Unit Awards, Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Unit Awards and shares of investment companies in the Franklin Templeton Investments funds awarded as part of an Incentive Award shall be distributed at such time during or after the end of the Plan Year as determined by the Committee. The number of shares of Stock, units or shares of investment companies in the Franklin Templeton Investments funds subject to such Incentive Awards as well as the other terms of such Incentive Awards shall be determined by the Committee and, if applicable, in accordance with the 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan or successor equity compensation plan.
 
VI. PAYMENT IN EVENT OF DEATH, DISABILITY, LEAVE OF ABSENCE OR RETIREMENT
 
6.1  Death of Participant.
 
A Participant who dies is entitled to a pro-rated Incentive Award based on performance up to the last day worked. Payment shall be made in cash in a single payment during or as soon as practical following the end of the Plan Year in which death occurred. If the Participant dies following the end of a Plan Year but before an Incentive Award for that year has been paid, the Participant's full Incentive Award shall be paid in cash in a single payment when it would otherwise have been paid. Payment of Incentive Awards on account of death shall be paid to the person designated by the Participant as beneficiary under this Plan. If there is no such designation or the designated beneficiary fails to survive the Participant, payment shall be made to the Participant's spouse or if there is none, the Participant's estate. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.1 with respect to the payment of Incentive Awards, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may (a) pay the Participant's full Incentive Award (or any greater amount) or (b) decrease (even to zero) the Participant's Incentive Award.
 
 
 
 
6.2  Disability.
 
A Participant who ceases to be an employee on account of permanent and total disability as a result of which the Participant shall be eligible for payments under Company long term disability insurance policies, shall be entitled to receive a pro-rated Incentive Award based on performance up to the last day worked. Payment shall be made in cash in a single installment during or as soon as practical following the end of the fiscal year in which employment terminated. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.2 with respect to the payment of Incentive Awards, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may (a) pay the Participant's full Incentive Award (or any greater amount) or (b) decrease (even to zero) the Participant's Incentive Award.
 
6.3  Leave of Absence.
 
The Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine Incentive Awards, if any, to be paid to Participants on leave of absence for any portion of the Plan Year.
 
6.4  Retirement.
 
A Participant who retires during the Plan Year is eligible to receive a pro-rated Incentive Award based on performance to the date of retirement in cash in a single payment during or as soon as practical following the end of the fiscal year in which the Participant retires. A Participant has "retired" for purposes of this Plan if he terminates employment with the Company after reaching age 55 with at least 10 years of service to the Company, including service to any entity that is acquired by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.4 with respect to the payment of Incentive Awards, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may (a) pay the Participant's full Incentive Award (or any greater amount) or (b) decrease (even to zero) the Participant's Incentive Award.
 
VII. PAYMENT IN EVENT OF TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT
 
7.1  Involuntary Termination of Employment.

VIII. AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION
 
8.1  Amendment.
 
The Committee reserves the right in its discretion to amend this Plan at any time in whole or in part, provided, however, that no amendment shall result in the forfeiture of any Participant's Incentive Awards earned as of the end of the fiscal year immediately preceding the date the Committee adopts the amendment.
 
8.2  Termination.
 
The Committee may terminate the Plan at any time. Termination shall not result in the forfeiture of any Participant's Incentive Awards which have been determined but not yet paid.
 
IX. ADMINISTRATION
 
9.1  Administration of the Plan.
 
This Plan has been adopted by the stockholders of Franklin Resources, Inc. and shall be administered by the Committee.
 
(a)  The Committee shall meet at such times and places and upon such notice as the chairperson determines in consultation with the other Committee members. A majority of the Committee shall constitute a quorum. Any acts by the Committee may be taken at any meeting at which a quorum is present and shall be by majority vote of those members entitled to vote. Additionally, any acts reduced to writing or approved in writing by all the members of the Committee shall be valid acts of the Committee.
 
(b)  Among the administrative responsibilities of the Committee shall be the determination of Principals and Associates, Target Awards and Incentive Awards. This may be accomplished by adopting specific methods of determining the Target Awards and/or Incentive Awards which are then administered by other management personnel of the Company.
 
 
 
 
(c)  The Committee shall have the sole authority, in its absolute discretion, to adopt, amend, and rescind such rules and regulations as, in its opinion, may be advisable in the administration of the Plan, to construe and interpret the Plan, the rules and regulations, and any instruments evidencing Incentive Awards and to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan. All decisions, determinations, and interpretations of the Committee shall be binding on all Participants.
 
(d)  The Plan is intended to meet the requirements of the rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and shall be administered and construed accordingly.
 
9.2  Non-alienation of Benefits.
 
No benefit under this Plan may be sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed, hypothecated, encumbered, anticipated, or otherwise disposed of, and any attempt to do so shall be void. No such benefit shall, prior to receipt thereof by a Participant, be in any manner subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements, or torts of such Participant.
 
9.3  No Limitation of Rights.
 
Nothing in this Plan shall be construed to limit in any way the Company's general personnel policies and procedures particularly with respect to the right of the Company to terminate a Participant's employment at any time for any reason whatsoever with or without cause; nor shall it be evidence of any agreement or understanding, express or implied, that the Company (a) will employ a Participant in any particular position, (b) will ensure participation in any incentive programs, or (c) will grant any awards for such programs.
 
9.4  Applicable Law.
 
The provisions of the Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, with the exception of California's conflict of laws provisions.
 
9.5  Mandatory Arbitration.
 
As part of this Plan, the Company is implementing an alternative dispute resolution procedure for its employees. In the event there is any dispute arising out of unlawful harassment, discrimination or termination of employment with the Company, which the parties are unable to resolve through direct discussion or mediation, regardless of the kind or type of dispute, the Participant and the Company agree to submit all such disputes exclusively to final and binding arbitration pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, or, if inapplicable, the provisions of applicable state law, or any
 
 
 
 
successor or replacement statutes, upon a request submitted in writing to the Human Resources Department within the applicable statutory limits or the statute of limitations. Any failure to timely request arbitration shall constitute a waiver of all rights to raise any claims in any forum arising out of any dispute that was subject to arbitration. The limitations period set forth in this paragraph shall not be subject to tolling, equitable or otherwise. Any agreement to arbitrate disputes contained in a securities registration application shall take precedence over this agreement. All substantive rights guaranteed under the statutes are still recognized through arbitration, and arbitration is merely a substituted forum for dispute resolutions.

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC.
AMENDED AND RESTATED ANNUAL INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN
RESTRICTED FUND UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT
 
This Restricted Fund Unit Award Agreement, together with any Appendix(es) attached hereto (hereinafter, collectively, the "Agreement"), is made as of the Award Date set forth in the Notice of Restricted Fund Unit Award (the "Notice of Award") between Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") and the Participant named therein ("Participant"). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the same meaning as set forth in the AIP (as defined below).
 
WITNESSETH:
 
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors and stockholders of the Company have adopted the Franklin Resources, Inc. Amended and Restated Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (the "AIP") to reward eligible individuals for contributions made to the Company; and
 
WHEREAS, the Company recognizes the efforts and contributions of Participant on behalf of the Company and its subsidiaries and desires to motivate Participant in Participant's work and provide an inducement to remain in the service of the Company and its subsidiaries; and
 
WHEREAS, the Company has determined that it would be to the advantage and in the interest of the Company and its stockholders to grant Participant an award (the "Award") of restricted fund units (the "Units"), as provided for in this Agreement and the Notice of Award, subject to certain restrictions, as a reward and an incentive for increased efforts and successful achievements;
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
 
1.
            
Restricted Fund Unit Award
. The Company is issuing to Participant Units as set forth in the Notice of Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Participant as owner thereof as set forth in this Agreement
 
2.
            
Transfer Restriction
. The Units may not be transferred by Participant in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Participant may designate a beneficiary of the Units in the event of Participant's death on the beneficiary designation form included in the Notice of Award. The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and transferees of Participant
 
 
(a)
                 
The Units shall become vested in accordance with the Vesting Schedule in the Notice of Award so long as Participant maintains a continuous status as an employee of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company.
 
(b)
                 
If Participant ceases to maintain a continuous status as an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries for any reason other than death or disability (as described in subparagraph (c)), all Units to the extent not yet vested under subparagraph (a) on the date Participant ceases to be an employee
 
 
 
 
 
1
 
 
shall be forfeited by Participant without payment of any consideration to Participant therefor. Any Units so forfeited shall be canceled.
 
(c)
                 
If Participant dies or in the event of termination of Participant's continuous status as an employee as a result of disability (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance with the policies of the Company) while an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, the Units awarded hereunder shall become fully vested as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board of Directors of the Company, "disability" means that Participant ceases to be an employee on account of permanent and total disability as a result of which Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long-term disability policy.
 
(d)
                 
In the event of a proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company or of a merger or corporate combination of the Company (a "Transaction") in which the successor entity does not agree to assume the Award or substitute an equivalent award, the Company shall make a determination as to the equitable treatment of the Award and shall notify Participant of such treatment no later than ten (10) days prior to the consummation of such proposed Transaction. In the event the Award is not assumed in connection with a Transaction, the Award will terminate upon the consummation of such proposed Transaction.
 
 
(a)
                 
Upon each vesting date, the value of one share of the applicable class of a series of an investment company in the Franklin Templeton Investments funds ("fund") shall be issuable for each Unit that vests on such date (the "Shares"), subject to the terms and provisions of the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement. Any fractional Unit that vests on a particular date shall be converted into the value of a fractional Share. Thereafter, the Company will transfer to a broker and/or dealer or equivalent entity authorized to effect transactions in such fund shares for the account of others (the "Broker/Dealer") in the jurisdiction of Participant's employment, or cause such Broker/Dealer to receive or otherwise credit, the aggregate Vested Value (as defined below) of such Shares for the benefit of such Participant. The Broker/Dealer will then cause the Shares to be acquired on behalf of Participant and, thereafter, the Broker/Dealer will transfer such Shares to Participant. Any Shares in a fund shall be advisor class shares or equivalent, if available; otherwise, they shall be Class A shares or equivalent or, if unavailable, the Company shall make a determination as to the class of Shares. Notwithstanding the above, the Company may, in its discretion, pay to Participant all or a portion of any vested Units in cash in an amount equal to the Vested Value of the Shares. The Shares or equivalent cash payment will be issued to Participant as soon as practicable after the vesting date, but in any event, within the period ending on the later to occur of the date that is two and a half (2) months from the end of (i) Participant's tax year that includes the applicable vesting date, or (ii) the Company's tax year that includes the applicable vesting date.
 
(b)
                 
"Vested Value" shall mean: (i) with regard to Shares of closed-end funds, the number of vested Shares multiplied by the closing price per share of the applicable fund on the primary stock exchange or NASDAQ stock market, as applicable, on which such fund then trades on the date the underlying Units vested (or, if such date is not a trading day, on the last trading day prior to such date), less any required tax or other withholding; or (ii) with regard to non-closed end funds, the aggregate Net Asset Value (as defined below) of the Shares on the date the underlying Units vested, less any required tax or other withholding obligations.
 
 
2
 
 
 
(c)
                 
"Net Asset Value" shall mean the net asset value per share of the applicable non-closed end fund calculated on the date of determination as detailed in the fund's prospectus (or, if the date of determination is not a trading day, on the last trading day prior to the date of determination).
 
(d)
                 
In the event any one or more of the funds set forth in the Notice of Award ceases to exist, the shares of such fund represented by Units subject to the Award shall be replaced with shares of a comparable fund in the Franklin Templeton Investments funds which preserves the compensation element of the Award existing at the time the fund ceases to exist. The determination of fund comparability shall be made by the Committee and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive.
 
 
(a)
                 
Except as set forth in paragraph 5(b) of this Agreement, Participant shall not have any right in, to or with respect to any of the Shares (including any voting rights) issuable under the Award until the Award is settled by the issuance of such Shares to Participant.
 
(b)
                 
Any dividends that are paid from time to time with respect to the Shares represented by the Units shall be deemed reinvested in the Shares with respect to which the dividend was paid, shall be credited to Participant as additional Units and shall vest upon the same vesting date (in accordance with the Notice of Award) of the corresponding Units pursuant to which the dividends were originally paid.
 
 
(a)
                 
General
. Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by Participant in connection with the Units awarded, regardless of any action the Company or any of its subsidiaries takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Units awarded. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of the Units awarded or the subsequent sale of any of the Shares. The Company and its subsidiaries do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the Award to reduce or eliminate Participant's tax liability.
 
(b)
                 
Payment of Withholding Taxes
. Prior to any event in connection with the Units awarded (
e.g.
, vesting) that the Company determines may result in any tax withholding obligation, whether United States federal, state or local taxes and including any employment tax obligation (the "Tax Withholding Obligation"), Participant must arrange for the satisfaction of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company, including by means of one of the following methods:
 
(i)
   
By Unit Withholding.
Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (ii) below, Participant authorizes the Company (in the exercise of its sole discretion) to withhold the number of Units sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation, provided that the Company shall withhold only the amount of Units necessary to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Unit withholding will result in issuance of a lower number of Shares or amount of equivalent cash, as applicable, to Participant.
 
(ii)
   
By Check, Wire Transfer or Other Means
. At any time not less than five (5) business days (or such fewer number of days as determined by the Committee or its designee) before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises (
e.g.
, a vesting date), Participant may elect to satisfy the
 
3
 
 
minimum Tax Withholding Obligation by delivering to the Company an amount that the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation by (x) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (y) delivery of a certified check payable to the Company, or (z) such other means as specified from time to time by the Committee or its designee.
 
7.
                    
Successors
. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. Nothing contained in the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be interpreted as imposing any liability on the Company or the Committee in favor of Participant or any purchaser or other transferee of Units with respect to any loss, cost or expense which such Participant, purchaser or other transferee may incur in connection with, or arising out of any transaction involving, any Units subject to the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement.
 
8.
                   
No Compensation Deferrals
. None of the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement are intended to provide for an elective deferral of compensation that would be subject to Section 409A ("Section 409A") of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Company reserves the right, to the extent the Company deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, to unilaterally amend or modify the AIP, the Notice of Award and/or this Agreement to ensure that no awards (including, without limitation, the Units) become subject to the requirements of Section 409A, provided, however, that the Company makes no representation that the Units are not subject to Section 409A nor makes any undertaking to preclude Section 409A from applying to the Units.
 
9.
                   
Integration
. The terms of the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement are intended by the Company and Participant to be the final expression of their agreement with respect to the Units and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous agreement. The Company and Participant further intend that the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall constitute the complete and exclusive statement of their terms and that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may be introduced in any arbitration, judicial, administrative or other legal proceeding involving the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement. Accordingly, the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement contain the entire understanding between the parties and supersede all prior oral, written and implied agreements, understandings, commitments and practices among the parties.
 
10.
                 
Waivers
. Any failure to enforce any terms or conditions of the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement by the Company or by Participant shall not be deemed a waiver of that term or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power for all or any other times.
 
11.
                 
Severability of Provisions
. If any provision of the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision thereof; and the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if neither of them included such provision.
 
12.
                 
Committee Decisions Conclusive
. This Agreement and the Notice of Award are administered and interpreted by the Committee and the Committee has full and exclusive discretion to interpret and administer this Agreement and the Notice of Award. All actions, interpretations and decisions of the Committee are conclusive and binding on all persons, and will be given the maximum possible deference allowed by law.
 
 
4
 
 
 
13.
                 
Mandatory Arbitration
. To the extent permitted by law, any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Notice of Award and the AIP, including the meaning or interpretation thereof, shall be resolved solely by arbitration before an arbitrator selected in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The location for the arbitration shall be in the county or comparable jurisdiction of Participant's employment. Judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each party shall pay an equal share of the arbitrator's fees. All statutes of limitation which would otherwise be applicable shall apply to any arbitration proceeding under this paragraph. The provisions of this paragraph are intended by Participant and the Company to be exclusive for all purposes and applicable to any and all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Notice of Award and the AIP. The arbitrator who hears and decides any dispute shall have jurisdiction and authority only to award compensatory damages to make whole a person or entity sustaining foreseeable economic damages, and shall not have jurisdiction and authority to make any other award of any type, including without limitation, punitive damages, unforeseeable economic damage, damages for pain, suffering or emotional distress, or any other kind or form of damages. The remedy, if any, awarded by the arbitrator shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any dispute which is subject to arbitration under this paragraph.
 
14.
                 
Delaware Law
. The Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced according to the laws of the State of Delaware to the extent not preempted by the federal laws of the United States of America.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
 
1.
   
          
Restricted Fund Unit Award
. The Company is issuing to Participant Units as set forth in the Notice of Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Participant as owner thereof as set forth in this Agreement.

If Participant dies or in the event of termination of Participant's continuous status as an employee as a result of disability (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance with the policies of the Company) while an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, the Units awarded hereunder shall become fully vested as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board of Directors of the Company, "disability" means that Participant ceases to be an employee on account of permanent and total disability as a result of which Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long-term disability policy.
 
(d)
                 
In the event of a proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company or of a merger or corporate combination of the Company (a "Transaction") in which the successor entity does not agree to assume the Award or substitute an equivalent award, the Company shall make a determination as to the equitable treatment of the Award and shall notify Participant of such treatment no later than ten (10) days prior to the consummation of such proposed Transaction. In the event the Award is not assumed in connection with a Transaction, the Award will terminate upon the consummation of such proposed Transaction.
 
 
(a)
                 
Upon each vesting date, the value of one share of the applicable class of a series of an investment company in the Franklin Templeton Investments funds ("fund") shall be issuable for each Unit that vests on such date (the "Shares"), subject to the terms and provisions of the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement. Any fractional Unit that vests on a particular date shall be converted into the value of a fractional Share. Thereafter, the Company will transfer to a broker and/or dealer or equivalent entity authorized to effect transactions in such fund shares for the account of others (the "Broker/Dealer") in the jurisdiction of Participant's employment, or cause such Broker/Dealer to receive or otherwise credit, the aggregate Vested Value (as defined below) of such Shares for the benefit of such Participant. The Broker/Dealer will then cause the Shares to be acquired on behalf of Participant and, thereafter, the Broker/Dealer will transfer such Shares to Participant. Any Shares in a fund shall be advisor class shares or equivalent, if available; otherwise, they shall be Class A shares or equivalent or, if unavailable, the Company shall make a determination as to the class of Shares. Notwithstanding the above, the Company may, in its discretion, pay to Participant all or a portion of any vested Units in cash in an amount equal to the Vested Value of the Shares. The Shares or equivalent cash payment will be issued to Participant as soon as practicable after the vesting date, but in any event, within the period ending on the later to occur of the date that is two and a half (2) months from the end of (i) Participant's tax year that includes the applicable vesting date, or (ii) the Company's tax year that includes the applicable vesting date.
 
(b)
                 
"Vested Value" shall mean: (i) with regard to Shares of closed-end funds, the number of vested Shares multiplied by the closing price per share of the applicable fund on the primary stock exchange or NASDAQ stock market, as applicable, on which such fund then trades on the date the underlying Units vested (or, if such date is not a trading day, on the last trading day prior to such date), less any required tax or other withholding; or (ii) with regard to non-closed end funds, the aggregate Net Asset Value (as defined below) of the Shares on the date the underlying Units vested, less any required tax or other withholding obligations.
 
(c)
                 
"Net Asset Value" shall mean the net asset value per share of the applicable non-closed end fund calculated on the date of determination as detailed in the fund's prospectus (or, if the date of determination is not a trading day, on the last trading day prior to the date of determination).
 
 
2
 
 
 
(d)
                 
In the event any one or more of the funds set forth in the Notice of Award ceases to exist, the shares of such fund represented by Units subject to the Award shall be replaced with shares of a comparable fund in the Franklin Templeton Investments funds which preserves the compensation element of the Award existing at the time the fund ceases to exist. The determination of fund comparability shall be made by the Committee and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive.
 
 
(a)
                 
Except as set forth in paragraph 5(b) of this Agreement, Participant shall not have any right in, to or with respect to any of the Shares (including any voting rights) issuable under the Award until the Award is settled by the issuance of such Shares to Participant.
 
(b)
                 
Any dividends that are paid from time to time with respect to the Shares represented by the Units shall be deemed reinvested in the Shares with respect to which the dividend was paid and shall be credited to Participant as additional Units. All such additional Units shall vest upon the next immediately following vesting date (in accordance with the Notice of Award).
 
 
(a)
                 
General
. Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by Participant in connection with the Units awarded, regardless of any action the Company or any of its subsidiaries takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Units awarded. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of the Units awarded or the subsequent sale of any of the Shares. The Company and its subsidiaries do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the Award to reduce or eliminate Participant's tax liability.
 
(b)
                 
Payment of Withholding Taxes
. Prior to any event in connection with the Units awarded (
e.g.
, vesting) that the Company determines may result in any tax withholding obligation, whether United States federal, state or local taxes and including any employment tax obligation (the "Tax Withholding Obligation"), Participant must arrange for the satisfaction of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company, including by means of one of the following methods:
 
(i)
   
By Unit Withholding.
Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (ii) below, Participant authorizes the Company (in the exercise of its sole discretion) to withhold the number of Units sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation, provided that the Company shall withhold only the amount of Units necessary to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Unit withholding will result in issuance of a lower number of Shares or amount of equivalent cash, as applicable, to Participant.
 
(ii)
   
By Check, Wire Transfer or Other Means
. At any time not less than five (5) business days (or such fewer number of days as determined by the Committee or its designee) before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises (
e.g.
, a vesting date), Participant may elect to satisfy the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation by delivering to the Company an amount that the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation by (x) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (y) delivery of a certified check payable to the Company, or (z) such other means as specified from time to time by the Committee or its designee.

Successors
. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. Nothing contained in the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be interpreted as imposing any liability on the Company or the Committee in favor of Participant or any purchaser or other transferee of Units with respect to any loss, cost or expense which such Participant, purchaser or other transferee may incur in connection with, or arising out of any transaction involving, any Units subject to the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement.
 
8.
   
                
No Compensation Deferrals
. None of the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement are intended to provide for an elective deferral of compensation that would be subject to Section 409A ("Section 409A") of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Company reserves the right, to the extent the Company deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, to unilaterally amend or modify the AIP, the Notice of Award and/or this Agreement to ensure that no awards (including, without limitation, the Units) become subject to the requirements of Section 409A, provided, however, that the Company makes no representation that the Units are not subject to Section 409A nor makes any undertaking to preclude Section 409A from applying to the Units.
 
9.
   
                
Integration
.

The Company and Participant further intend that the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall constitute the complete and exclusive statement of their terms and that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may be introduced in any arbitration, judicial, administrative or other legal proceeding involving the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement. Accordingly, the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement contain the entire understanding between the parties and supersede all prior oral, written and implied agreements, understandings, commitments and practices among the parties.
 
10.
                 
Waivers
. Any failure to enforce any terms or conditions of the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement by the Company or by Participant shall not be deemed a waiver of that term or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power for all or any other times.
 
11.
                 
Severability of Provisions
. If any provision of the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision thereof; and the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if neither of them included such provision.

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC.
2002 UNIVERSAL STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN
RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT
 
This Restricted Stock Award Agreement, together with any Appendix(es) attached hereto (hereinafter, collectively, the "Agreement"), is made as of the Award Date set forth in the Notice of Restricted Stock Award (the "Notice of Award") between Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") and the Participant named therein ("Participant").
 
WITNESSETH:
 
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors and stockholders of the Company have adopted the Franklin Resources, Inc. 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (the "2002 Plan"), authorizing the grant of common stock of the Company ("Stock") to eligible individuals in connection with the performance of services for the Company and its Subsidiaries, as defined in the 2002 Plan, which is incorporated herein by this reference (capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the same meaning as set forth in the 2002 Plan or the Notice of Award, as applicable); and
 
WHEREAS, the Company recognizes the efforts and contributions of Participant on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, as a reward for such efforts and contributions, has determined to pay Participant an award in Stock provided for in this Agreement and the Notice of Award to Participant, subject to certain restrictions;
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
 
1.
   
          
Restricted Stock Award
. The Company is issuing to Participant shares of Stock as set forth in the Notice of Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Participant as owner thereof as set forth in this Agreement. Such shares are being issued in book entry form and maintained on the books of the Bank of New York, the Company's transfer agent, or any successor thereto. All shares of Stock issued hereunder shall be deemed issued to Participant as fully paid and non assessable shares, and, subject to the restrictions set forth in the 2002 Plan and this Agreement, Participant shall have all rights of a stockholder with respect thereto, including the right to vote, to receive dividends (including stock dividends), to participate in stock splits or other recapitalizations, and to exchange such shares in a tender offer, merger, consolidation or other reorganization. The Company shall pay any applicable stock transfer taxes. Participant hereby acknowledges that Participant is acquiring the Stock issued hereunder for investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof, and that Participant does not intend to subdivide Participant's interest in the Stock with any other person.
 
 
(a)
                 
No Stock issued to Participant hereunder shall be sold, transferred by gift, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise transferred or disposed of by Participant prior to the date on which it becomes vested under paragraph 3, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This paragraph shall not preclude Participant from exchanging the Stock awarded hereunder pursuant to a cash or stock tender offer, merger, reorganization or consolidation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any securities (including stock dividends and stock splits) received with respect to shares of Stock which are not yet vested under
 
1
 
 
paragraph 3 shall be subject to the provisions of this Agreement in the same manner and shall become fully vested at the same time as the Stock with respect to which such additional securities were issued.
 
(b)
                 
Participant acknowledges that, from time to time, the Company may be in a "Blackout Period" and/or subject to applicable securities laws that could subject Participant to liability for engaging in any transaction involving the sale of the Company's shares. Participant further acknowledges and agrees that, prior to the sale of any shares acquired under this Award, it is Participant's responsibility to determine whether or not such sale of shares will subject Participant to liability under insider trading rules or other applicable securities laws.
 
 
(a)
                 
Participant's interest in the Stock awarded under paragraph 1 shall become vested and nonforfeitable in accordance with the Vesting Schedule in the Notice of Award so long as Participant maintains a Continuous Status as an Employee of the Company or a Subsidiary. Upon vesting, the Company shall, within thirty (30) days of such vesting, deliver to Participant the certificates evidencing the nonforfeitable shares (free of restrictive legends on such stock certificates), provided the withholding requirements of paragraph 4 have been satisfied. Alternatively, provided the withholding requirements of paragraph 4 have been satisfied, the Committee may permit or require that such nonforfeitable shares of Stock (free of the restrictive notations on shares of Stock issued in book-entry form) be deposited directly with a brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose or to a designated agent of the Company, and the Committee may utilize electronic or automated methods of share transfer.
 
(b)
                 
If Participant ceases to maintain a Continuous Status as an Employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason other than death or disability (as described in subparagraph (c)), all shares of Stock to the extent not yet vested under subparagraph (a) on the date Participant ceases to be an employee shall be forfeited by Participant without payment of any consideration to Participant therefor. Any shares of Stock so forfeited shall be canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares, to be held for future distributions under the Company's 2002 Plan.
 
(c)
                 
If Participant dies or in the event of termination of Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee as a result of disability (as determined by the Board in accordance with the policies of the Company) while an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Participant's interest in all shares of Stock awarded hereunder shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board, "disability" means that Participant ceases to be an employee on account of permanent and total disability as a result of which Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long-term disability policy.
 
(a)
               
General
. Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by Participant in connection with the Stock awarded, regardless of any action the Company or any of its Subsidiaries takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Stock awarded. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of the Stock awarded or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Stock. The Company and its Subsidiaries do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the Award to reduce or eliminate Participant's tax liability.
 
2
 
 
 
(b)
               
Payment of Withholding Taxes
. Prior to any event in connection with the Stock awarded (
e.g.
, vesting) that the Company determines may result in any tax withholding obligation, whether United States federal, state or local taxes and including any employment tax obligation (the "Tax Withholding Obligation"), Participant must arrange for the satisfaction of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company, including by means of one of the following methods:
(i)
                
By Share Withholding.
Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, Participant authorizes the Company (in the exercise of its sole discretion) to withhold from those unrestricted shares of Stock to be delivered to Participant upon vesting under paragraph 3 above the whole number of shares sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation, provided that the Company shall withhold only the amount of shares necessary to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Share withholding will result in the delivery of a lower number of unrestricted shares of Stock to Participant. Share withholding will generally be used to satisfy the tax liability of individuals subject to the short-swing profit restrictions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
(ii)
                
By Sale of Shares
. Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, and provided that the terms of this clause (ii) do not violate Section 13(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Participant's acceptance of the Stock awarded constitutes Participant's instruction and authorization to the Company and any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose to sell on Participant's behalf a whole number of shares from those unrestricted shares of Stock to be delivered to Participant upon vesting under paragraph 3 above as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Such shares will be sold on the day such Tax Withholding Obligation arises (
e.g.
, a vesting date) or as soon thereafter as practicable. Participant will be responsible for all broker's fees and other costs of sale, and Participant agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale. To the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed the Tax Withholding Obligation, the Company agrees to pay such excess in cash to Participant. Participant acknowledges that the Company or its designee is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price, and that the proceeds of any such sale may not be sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, Participant agrees to pay to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the sale of shares described above.
(iii)
                
By Check, Wire Transfer or Other Means
. At any time not less than five (5) business days (or such fewer number of days as determined by the Committee or its designee) before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises (
e.g.
, a vesting date), Participant may elect to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by delivering to the Company an amount that the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by (x) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (y) delivery of a certified check payable to the Company, or (z) such other means as specified from time to time by the Committee or its designee.
5.
                    
Successors
. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. Nothing contained in the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be interpreted as imposing any liability on the Company or the Committee in favor of Participant or any purchaser or other transferee of Stock with respect to any loss, cost or expense which such Participant, purchaser or other transferee may
 
3
 
 
incur in connection with, or arising out of any transaction involving, any shares of Stock subject to the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement.
 
6.
   
               
Integration
. The terms of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement are intended by the Company and Participant to be the final expression of their agreement with respect to the shares of Stock and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous agreement. The Company and Participant further intend that the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall constitute the complete and exclusive statement of their terms and that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may be introduced in any arbitration, judicial, administrative or other legal proceeding involving the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement. Accordingly, the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement contain the entire understanding between the parties and supersede all prior oral, written and implied agreements, understandings, commitments and practices among the parties.
 
7.
   
               
Waivers
. Any failure to enforce any terms or conditions of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement by the Company or by Participant shall not be deemed a waiver of that term or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power for all or any other times.
 
8.
   
               
Severability of Provisions
. If any provision of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision thereof; and the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if none of them included such provision.
 
9.
   
               
Committee Decisions Conclusive
. All decisions of the Committee arising under the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be conclusive.
 
10.
                 
Mandatory Arbitration
. To the extent permitted by law, any dispute arising out of or relating to the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement, including the meaning or interpretation thereof, shall be resolved solely by arbitration before an arbitrator selected in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The location for the arbitration shall be in the county or comparable jurisdiction of Participant's employment. Judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each party shall pay an equal share of the arbitrator's fees. All statutes of limitation which would otherwise be applicable shall apply to any arbitration proceeding under this paragraph. The provisions of this paragraph are intended by Participant and the Company to be exclusive for all purposes and applicable to any and all disputes arising out of or relating to the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement. The arbitrator who hears and decides any dispute shall have jurisdiction and authority only to award compensatory damages to make whole a person or entity sustaining foreseeable economic damages, and shall not have jurisdiction and authority to make any other award of any type, including without limitation, punitive damages, unforeseeable economic damage, damages for pain, suffering or emotional distress, or any other kind or form of damages. The remedy, if any, awarded by the arbitrator shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any dispute which is subject to arbitration under this paragraph.
 
11.
                 
Delaware Law
. The 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced according to the laws of the State of Delaware to the extent not preempted by the federal laws of the United States of America.

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC.
2002 UNIVERSAL STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN
RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT
 
This Restricted Stock Award Agreement, together with any Appendix(es) attached hereto (hereinafter, collectively, the "Agreement"), is made as of the Award Date set forth in the Notice of Restricted Stock Award (the "Notice of Award") between Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") and the Participant named therein ("Participant").
 
WITNESSETH:
 
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors and stockholders of the Company have adopted the Franklin Resources, Inc. 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (the "2002 Plan"), authorizing the grant of common stock of the Company ("Stock") to eligible individuals in connection with the performance of services for the Company and its Subsidiaries, as defined in the 2002 Plan, which is incorporated herein by this reference (capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the same meaning as set forth in the 2002 Plan or the Notice of Award, as applicable); and
 
WHEREAS, the Company recognizes the efforts of Participant on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries and desires to motivate Participant in Participant's work and provide an inducement to remain in the service of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and
 
WHEREAS, the Company has determined that it would be to the advantage and in the interest of the Company and its stockholders to award the Stock provided for in this Agreement and the Notice of Award to Participant, subject to certain restrictions, as a reward and an incentive for increased efforts and successful achievements;
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
 
1.
            
Restricted Stock Award
. The Company is issuing to Participant shares of Stock as set forth in the Notice of Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Participant as owner thereof as set forth in this Agreement. Such shares are being issued in book entry form and maintained on the books of the Bank of New York, the Company's transfer agent, or any successor thereto. All shares of Stock issued hereunder shall be deemed issued to Participant as fully paid and non assessable shares, and, subject to the restrictions set forth in the 2002 Plan and this Agreement, Participant shall have all rights of a stockholder with respect thereto, including the right to vote, to receive dividends (including stock dividends), to participate in stock splits or other recapitalizations, and to exchange such shares in a tender offer, merger, consolidation or other reorganization. The Company shall pay any applicable stock transfer taxes. Participant hereby acknowledges that Participant is acquiring the Stock issued hereunder for investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof, and that Participant does not intend to subdivide Participant's interest in the Stock with any other person.
 
 
(a)
                 
No Stock issued to Participant hereunder shall be sold, transferred by gift, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise transferred or disposed of by Participant prior to the date on which it becomes vested under paragraph 3, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This paragraph shall not preclude Participant from exchanging the Stock awarded hereunder pursuant to a cash or stock tender
 
1
 
 
offer, merger, reorganization or consolidation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any securities (including stock dividends and stock splits) received with respect to shares of Stock which are not yet vested under paragraph 3 shall be subject to the provisions of this Agreement in the same manner and shall become fully vested at the same time as the Stock with respect to which such additional securities were issued.
 
(b)
                 
Participant acknowledges that, from time to time, the Company may be in a "Blackout Period" and/or subject to applicable securities laws that could subject Participant to liability for engaging in any transaction involving the sale of the Company's shares. Participant further acknowledges and agrees that, prior to the sale of any shares acquired under this Award, it is Participant's responsibility to determine whether or not such sale of shares will subject Participant to liability under insider trading rules or other applicable securities laws.
 
 
(a)
                 
Participant's interest in the Stock awarded under paragraph 1 shall become vested and nonforfeitable in accordance with the Vesting Schedule in the Notice of Award so long as Participant maintains a Continuous Status as an Employee of the Company or a Subsidiary. Upon vesting, the Company shall, within thirty (30) days of such vesting, deliver to Participant the certificates evidencing the nonforfeitable shares (free of restrictive legends on such stock certificates), provided the withholding requirements of paragraph 4 have been satisfied. Alternatively, provided the withholding requirements of paragraph 4 have been satisfied, the Committee may permit or require that such nonforfeitable shares of Stock (free of the restrictive notations on shares of Stock issued in book-entry form) be deposited directly with a brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose or to a designated agent of the Company, and the Committee may utilize electronic or automated methods of share transfer.
 
(b)
                 
If Participant ceases to maintain a Continuous Status as an Employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason other than death or disability (as described in subparagraph (c)), all shares of Stock to the extent not yet vested under subparagraph (a) on the date Participant ceases to be an employee shall be forfeited by Participant without payment of any consideration to Participant therefor. Any shares of Stock so forfeited shall be canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares, to be held for future distributions under the Company's 2002 Plan.
 
(c)
                 
If Participant dies or in the event of termination of Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee as a result of disability (as determined by the Board in accordance with the policies of the Company) while an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Participant's interest in all shares of Stock awarded hereunder shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board, "disability" means that Participant ceases to be an employee on account of permanent and total disability as a result of which Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long-term disability policy.
 
(a)
               
General
. Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by Participant in connection with the Stock awarded, regardless of any action the Company or any of its Subsidiaries takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Stock awarded. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of the Stock awarded or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Stock. The Company and its Subsidiaries do not
 
2
 
 
commit and are under no obligation to structure the Award to reduce or eliminate Participant's tax liability.
(b)
               
Payment of Withholding Taxes
. Prior to any event in connection with the Stock awarded (
e.g.
, vesting) that the Company determines may result in any tax withholding obligation, whether United States federal, state or local taxes and including any employment tax obligation (the "Tax Withholding Obligation"), Participant must arrange for the satisfaction of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company, including by means of one of the following methods:
(i)
                
By Share Withholding.
Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, Participant authorizes the Company (in the exercise of its sole discretion) to withhold from those unrestricted shares of Stock to be delivered to Participant upon vesting under paragraph 3 above the whole number of shares sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation, provided that the Company shall withhold only the amount of shares necessary to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Share withholding will result in the delivery of a lower number of unrestricted shares of Stock to Participant. Share withholding will generally be used to satisfy the tax liability of individuals subject to the short-swing profit restrictions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
(ii)
               
By Sale of Shares
. Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, and provided that the terms of this clause (ii) do not violate Section 13(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Participant's acceptance of the Stock awarded constitutes Participant's instruction and authorization to the Company and any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose to sell on Participant's behalf a whole number of shares from those unrestricted shares of Stock to be delivered to Participant upon vesting under paragraph 3 above as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Such shares will be sold on the day such Tax Withholding Obligation arises (
e.g.
, a vesting date) or as soon thereafter as practicable. Participant will be responsible for all broker's fees and other costs of sale, and Participant agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale. To the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed the Tax Withholding Obligation, the Company agrees to pay such excess in cash to Participant. Participant acknowledges that the Company or its designee is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price, and that the proceeds of any such sale may not be sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, Participant agrees to pay to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the sale of shares described above.
(iii)
              
By Check, Wire Transfer or Other Means
. At any time not less than five (5) business days (or such fewer number of days as determined by the Committee or its designee) before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises (
e.g.
, a vesting date), Participant may elect to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by delivering to the Company an amount that the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by (x) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (y) delivery of a certified check payable to the Company, or (z) such other means as specified from time to time by the Committee or its designee.
5.
            
Successors
. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. Nothing contained in the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be interpreted as imposing any liability on the Company or the Committee in favor of Participant or any purchaser or other transferee of
 
3
 
 
Stock with respect to any loss, cost or expense which such Participant, purchaser or other transferee may incur in connection with, or arising out of any transaction involving, any shares of Stock subject to the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement.
 
6.
            
Integration
. The terms of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement are intended by the Company and Participant to be the final expression of their agreement with respect to the shares of Stock and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous agreement. The Company and Participant further intend that the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall constitute the complete and exclusive statement of their terms and that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may be introduced in any arbitration, judicial, administrative or other legal proceeding involving the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement. Accordingly, the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement contain the entire understanding between the parties and supersede all prior oral, written and implied agreements, understandings, commitments and practices among the parties.
 
7.
            
Waivers
. Any failure to enforce any terms or conditions of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement by the Company or by Participant shall not be deemed a waiver of that term or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power for all or any other times.
 
8.
            
Severability of Provisions
. If any provision of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision thereof; and the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if none of them included such provision.
 
9.
            
Committee Decisions Conclusive
. All decisions of the Committee arising under the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be conclusive.
 
10.
           
Mandatory Arbitration
. To the extent permitted by law, any dispute arising out of or relating to the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement, including the meaning or interpretation thereof, shall be resolved solely by arbitration before an arbitrator selected in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The location for the arbitration shall be in the county or comparable jurisdiction of Participant's employment. Judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each party shall pay an equal share of the arbitrator's fees. All statutes of limitation which would otherwise be applicable shall apply to any arbitration proceeding under this paragraph. The provisions of this paragraph are intended by Participant and the Company to be exclusive for all purposes and applicable to any and all disputes arising out of or relating to the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement. The arbitrator who hears and decides any dispute shall have jurisdiction and authority only to award compensatory damages to make whole a person or entity sustaining foreseeable economic damages, and shall not have jurisdiction and authority to make any other award of any type, including without limitation, punitive damages, unforeseeable economic damage, damages for pain, suffering or emotional distress, or any other kind or form of damages. The remedy, if any, awarded by the arbitrator shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any dispute which is subject to arbitration under this paragraph.
 
11.
           
Delaware Law
. The 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced according to the laws of the State of Delaware to the extent not preempted by the federal laws of the United States of America.

(the "Company") and the Participant named therein ("Participant").
 
WITNESSETH:
 
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors and stockholders of the Company have adopted the Franklin Resources, Inc. 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (the "2002 Plan"), authorizing the grant of Restricted Stock Units (as defined in the 2002 Plan) ("Units") to eligible individuals in connection with the performance of services for the Company and its Subsidiaries, as defined in the 2002 Plan, which is incorporated herein by this reference (capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the same meaning as set forth in the 2002 Plan or the Notice of Award, as applicable); and
 
WHEREAS, the Company recognizes the efforts and contributions of Participant on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, as a reward for such efforts and contributions, has determined to pay Participant an award in Units provided for in this Agreement and the Notice of Award to Participant, subject to certain restrictions;
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
 
1.
            
Restricted Stock Unit Award
. The Company is issuing to Participant Units as set forth in the Notice of Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Participant as owner thereof as set forth in this Agreement.
 
 
(a)

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Participant may designate a beneficiary of Units in the event of Participant's death on the beneficiary designation form included in the Notice of Award. The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and transferees of Participant.
 
(b)

1
 
 
 
 
(a)
                 
Units shall become vested in accordance with the Vesting Schedule in the Notice of Award so long as Participant maintains a Continuous Status as an Employee of the Company or a Subsidiary.
 
(b)
                 
If Participant ceases to maintain a Continuous Status as an Employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason other than death or disability (as described in subparagraph (c)), all Units to the extent not yet vested under subparagraph (a) on the date Participant ceases to be an employee shall be forfeited by Participant without payment of any consideration to Participant therefor. Any Units so forfeited shall be canceled and any shares considered issuable pursuant to such Units, if applicable, shall be returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares, to be held for future distributions under the Company's 2002 Plan.
 
(c)
                 
If Participant dies or in the event of termination of Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee as a result of disability (as determined by the Board in accordance with the policies of the Company) while an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Units awarded hereunder shall become fully vested as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board, "disability" means that Participant ceases to be an employee on account of permanent and total disability as a result of which Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long-term disability policy.
 
4.
                 
Conversion of Units and Issuance of Shares
. Upon each vesting date, one share of common stock ("Stock") shall be issuable for each Unit that vests on such date, subject to the terms and provisions of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement. Upon satisfaction of any required tax or other withholding obligations as set forth in paragraph 6 of this Agreement, the shares of Stock will be issued to Participant (as evidenced by the appropriate entry in the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) as soon as practicable after the vesting date, but in any event, within the period ending on the later to occur of the date that is two and a half (2) months from the end of (i) Participant's tax year that includes the applicable vesting date, or (ii) the Company's tax year that includes the applicable vesting date. Any fractional Unit remaining after all Units under this Award are fully vested shall be discarded and shall not be converted into a fractional share of Stock. Notwithstanding the above, the Company may, in its discretion, pay to Participant all or a portion of any vested Units in cash in an amount equal to the shares of Stock, less any tax or other withholding obligations set forth in paragraph 6 of this Agreement.
 
5.
                 
Right to Shares
. Participant shall not have any right in, to or with respect to any of the shares of Stock (including any voting rights or rights with respect to dividends paid on the Stock) issuable for a Unit under the Award until the Award is settled by the issuance of such shares of Stock to Participant.
 
 
(a)
               
General
. Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by Participant in connection with Units awarded, regardless of any action the Company or any of its Subsidiaries takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with Units awarded. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of Units awarded
 
2
 
 
or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Stock. The Company and its Subsidiaries do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the Award to reduce or eliminate Participant's tax liability.
 
(b)
               
Payment of Withholding Taxes
. Prior to any event in connection with Units awarded (
e.g.
, vesting) that the Company determines may result in any tax withholding obligation, whether United States federal, state or local taxes and including any employment tax obligation (the "Tax Withholding Obligation"), Participant must arrange for the satisfaction of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company, including by means of one of the following methods:
(i)
                
By Share Withholding.
Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, Participant authorizes the Company (in the exercise of its sole discretion) to withhold from those shares of Stock issuable to Participant the whole number of shares sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation, provided that the Company shall withhold only the amount of shares necessary to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Share withholding will result in issuance of a lower number of shares of Stock to Participant. Share withholding will generally be used to satisfy the tax liability of individuals subject to the short-swing profit restrictions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
 
(ii)
               
By Sale of Shares
. Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, and provided that the terms of this clause (ii) do not violate Section 13(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Participant's acceptance of the Award constitutes Participant's instruction and authorization to the Company and any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose to sell on Participant's behalf a whole number of shares from those shares of Stock issuable to Participant as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Such shares will be sold on the day such Tax Withholding Obligation arises (
e.g.
, a vesting date) or as soon thereafter as practicable. Participant will be responsible for all broker's fees and other costs of sale, and Participant agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale. To the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation, the Company agrees to pay such excess in cash to Participant. Participant acknowledges that the Company or its designee is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price, and that the proceeds of any such sale may not be sufficient to satisfy the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, Participant agrees to pay to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the sale of shares described above.
 
(iii)
              
By Check, Wire Transfer or Other Means
. At any time not less than five (5) business days (or such fewer number of days as determined by the Committee or its designee) before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises (
e.g.
, a vesting date), Participant may elect to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by delivering to the Company an amount that the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by (x) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (y) delivery of a certified check payable to the Company, or (z) such other means as specified from time to time by the Committee or its designee.
 
7.
                 
Successors
. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. Nothing contained in the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be interpreted as imposing any
 
3
 
 
liability on the Company or the Committee in favor of Participant or any purchaser or other transferee of Units or shares of Stock with respect to any loss, cost or expense which such Participant, purchaser or other transferee may incur in connection with, or arising out of any transaction involving, any Units or shares of Stock subject to the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement.
 
8.
                 
No Compensation Deferrals

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC.
2002 UNIVERSAL STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN
RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT
 
This Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement, together with any Appendix(es) attached hereto (hereinafter, collectively, the "Agreement"), is made as of the Award Date set forth in the Notice of Restricted Stock Unit Award (the "Notice of Award") between Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") and the Participant named therein ("Participant").
 
WITNESSETH:
 
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors and stockholders of the Company have adopted the Franklin Resources, Inc. 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (the "2002 Plan"), authorizing the grant of Restricted Stock Units (as defined in the 2002 Plan) ("Units") to eligible individuals in connection with the performance of services for the Company and its Subsidiaries, as defined in the 2002 Plan, which is incorporated herein by this reference (capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the same meaning as set forth in the 2002 Plan or the Notice of Award, as applicable); and
 
WHEREAS, the Company recognizes the efforts of Participant on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries and desires to motivate Participant in Participant's work and provide an inducement to remain in the service of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and
 
WHEREAS, the Company has determined that it would be to the advantage and in the interest of the Company and its stockholders to award Units provided for in this Agreement and the Notice of Award to Participant, subject to certain restrictions, as a reward and an incentive for increased efforts and successful achievements;
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
 
1.
            
Restricted Stock Unit Award
. The Company is issuing to Participant Units as set forth in the Notice of Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Participant as owner thereof as set forth in this Agreement.
 
 
(a)
                 
Units may not be transferred by Participant in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Participant may designate a beneficiary of Units in the event of Participant's death on the beneficiary designation form included in the Notice of Award. The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and transferees of Participant.
 
(b)
                 
Participant acknowledges that, from time to time, the Company may be in a "Blackout Period" and/or subject to applicable securities laws that could subject Participant to liability for engaging in any transaction involving the sale of the Company's shares. Participant further acknowledges and agrees that, prior to the sale of any shares acquired under this Award, it is Participant's responsibility to
 
1
 
 
determine whether or not such sale of shares will subject Participant to liability under insider trading rules or other applicable securities laws.
 
 
(a)
                 
Units shall become vested in accordance with the Vesting Schedule in the Notice of Award so long as Participant maintains a Continuous Status as an Employee of the Company or a Subsidiary.
 
(b)
                 
If Participant ceases to maintain a Continuous Status as an Employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason other than death or disability (as described in subparagraph (c)), all Units to the extent not yet vested under subparagraph (a) on the date Participant ceases to be an employee shall be forfeited by Participant without payment of any consideration to Participant therefor. Any Units so forfeited shall be canceled and any shares considered issuable pursuant to such Units, if applicable, shall be returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares, to be held for future distributions under the Company's 2002 Plan.
 
(c)
                 
If Participant dies or in the event of termination of Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee as a result of disability (as determined by the Board in accordance with the policies of the Company) while an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Units awarded hereunder shall become fully vested as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board, "disability" means that Participant ceases to be an employee on account of permanent and total disability as a result of which Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long-term disability policy.
 
4.
                 
Conversion of Units and Issuance of Shares
. Upon each vesting date, one share of common stock ("Stock") shall be issuable for each Unit that vests on such date, subject to the terms and provisions of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement. Upon satisfaction of any required tax or other withholding obligations as set forth in paragraph 6 of this Agreement, the shares of Stock will be issued to Participant (as evidenced by the appropriate entry in the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) as soon as practicable after the vesting date, but in any event, within the period ending on the later to occur of the date that is two and a half (2) months from the end of (i) Participant's tax year that includes the applicable vesting date, or (ii) the Company's tax year that includes the applicable vesting date. Any fractional Unit remaining after all Units under this Award are fully vested shall be discarded and shall not be converted into a fractional share of Stock. Notwithstanding the above, the Company may, in its discretion, pay to Participant all or a portion of any vested Units in cash in an amount equal to the shares of Stock, less any tax or other withholding obligations set forth in paragraph 6 of this Agreement.
 
5.
                 
Right to Shares
. Participant shall not have any right in, to or with respect to any of the shares of Stock (including any voting rights or rights with respect to dividends paid on the Stock) issuable for a Unit under the Award until the Award is settled by the issuance of such shares of Stock to Participant.
 
 
(a)
               
General
. Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by Participant in connection with Units awarded, regardless of any action the Company or any of its
 
2
 
 
Subsidiaries takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with Units awarded. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of Units awarded or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Stock. The Company and its Subsidiaries do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the Award to reduce or eliminate Participant's tax liability.
 
(b)
                
Payment of Withholding Taxes
. Prior to any event in connection with Units awarded (
e.g.
, vesting) that the Company determines may result in any tax withholding obligation, whether United States federal, state or local taxes and including any employment tax obligation (the "Tax Withholding Obligation"), Participant must arrange for the satisfaction of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company, including by means of one of the following methods:
(i)
                
By Share Withholding.
Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, Participant authorizes the Company (in the exercise of its sole discretion) to withhold from those shares of Stock issuable to Participant the whole number of shares sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation, provided that the Company shall withhold only the amount of shares necessary to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Share withholding will result in issuance of a lower number of shares of Stock to Participant. Share withholding will generally be used to satisfy the tax liability of individuals subject to the short-swing profit restrictions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
 
(ii)
               
By Sale of Shares
. Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, and provided that the terms of this clause (ii) do not violate Section 13(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Participant's acceptance of the Award constitutes Participant's instruction and authorization to the Company and any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose to sell on Participant's behalf a whole number of shares from those shares of Stock issuable to Participant as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Such shares will be sold on the day such Tax Withholding Obligation arises (
e.g.
, a vesting date) or as soon thereafter as practicable. Participant will be responsible for all broker's fees and other costs of sale, and Participant agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale. To the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation, the Company agrees to pay such excess in cash to Participant. Participant acknowledges that the Company or its designee is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price, and that the proceeds of any such sale may not be sufficient to satisfy the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, Participant agrees to pay to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the sale of shares described above.
 
(iii)
              
By Check, Wire Transfer or Other Means
. At any time not less than five (5) business days (or such fewer number of days as determined by the Committee or its designee) before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises (
e.g.
, a vesting date), Participant may elect to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by delivering to the Company an amount that the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by (x) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (y) delivery of a certified check payable to the Company, or (z) such other means as specified from time to time by the Committee or its designee.
 
 
3
 
 
 
7.
                 
Successors
. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. Nothing contained in the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be interpreted as imposing any liability on the Company or the Committee in favor of Participant or any purchaser or other transferee of Units or shares of Stock with respect to any loss, cost or expense which such Participant, purchaser or other transferee may incur in connection with, or arising out of any transaction involving, any Units or shares of Stock subject to the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement.
 
8.
                 
No Compensation Deferrals
. None of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement are intended to provide for an elective deferral of compensation that would be subject to Section 409A ("Section 409A") of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Company reserves the right, to the extent the Company deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, to unilaterally amend or modify the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and/or this Agreement to ensure that no awards (including, without limitation, the Units) become subject to the requirements of Section 409A, provided, however, that the Company makes no representation that the Units are not subject to Section 409A nor makes any undertaking to preclude Section 409A from applying to the Units.
 
9.
                 
Integration
. The terms of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement are intended by the Company and Participant to be the final expression of their agreement with respect to Units and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous agreement. The Company and Participant further intend that the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall constitute the complete and exclusive statement of their terms and that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may be introduced in any arbitration, judicial, administrative or other legal proceeding involving the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement. Accordingly, the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement contain the entire understanding between the parties and supersede all prior oral, written and implied agreements, understandings, commitments and practices among the parties.
 
10.
                 
Waivers
. Any failure to enforce any terms or conditions of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement by the Company or by Participant shall not be deemed a waiver of that term or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power for all or any other times.
 
11.
                 
Severability of Provisions
. If any provision of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision thereof; and the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if none of them included such provision.
 
12.
                 
Committee Decisions Conclusive
. All decisions of the Committee arising under the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be conclusive.
 
13.
                 
Mandatory Arbitration
. To the extent permitted by law, any dispute arising out of or relating to the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement, including the meaning or interpretation thereof, shall be resolved solely by arbitration before an arbitrator selected in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The location for the arbitration shall be in the county or comparable jurisdiction of Participant's employment. Judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each party shall pay an equal share of the arbitrator's fees. All statutes of limitation which would otherwise be applicable shall apply to any arbitration proceeding under this paragraph. The provisions of this paragraph are intended by Participant and the Company to be exclusive for all purposes and applicable to any and all disputes arising out of or relating to the 2002
 
4
 
 
Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement. The arbitrator who hears and decides any dispute shall have jurisdiction and authority only to award compensatory damages to make whole a person or entity sustaining foreseeable economic damages, and shall not have jurisdiction and authority to make any other award of any type, including without limitation, punitive damages, unforeseeable economic damage, damages for pain, suffering or emotional distress, or any other kind or form of damages. The remedy, if any, awarded by the arbitrator shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any dispute which is subject to arbitration under this paragraph.
 
14.
                 
Delaware Law
. The 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced according to the laws of the State of Delaware to the extent not preempted by the federal laws of the United States of America.

________________________________________________________________
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Franklin Resources, Inc. Announces Commencement of Conversion Period for
Liquid Yield Option Notes Due 2031 (Zero Coupon-Senior)
 
San Mateo, CA, December 15, 2005  Franklin Resources, Inc. [NYSE:BEN] (the "Company") announced today that commencing January 1, 2006, the Company's Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2031 (Zero Coupon-Senior) ("LYONs") will become eligible for conversion into shares of the Company's common stock, because the closing price of the Company's common stock exceeded the conversion trigger price of $78.65 for at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days in the quarter ending December 31, 2005. Holders may convert their LYONs into shares of the Company's common stock at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on March 31, 2006. Subject to the indenture, the LYONS may be eligible for conversion in subsequent fiscal quarters if, among other things, certain market price conditions are satisfied.
Pursuant to the terms of the indenture under which the LYONs were issued, the LYONs will be convertible at a rate of 9.3604 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of LYONs surrendered for conversion, subject to adjustment as provided in the indenture under which the LYONs were issued in May 2001. Cash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares. Upon conversion, a holder will not receive any cash payment representing accrued original issue discount.
If all outstanding LYONs were surrendered for conversion, the aggregate number of shares of common stock issued would be approximately 8,135,000. In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04-8, the dilutive effect of this potential issuance has already been reflected in the Company's diluted earnings per share reported in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005.
 
 
 
Franklin Resources, Inc. [NYSE:BEN] is a global investment management organization operating as Franklin Templeton Investments. Franklin Templeton Investments provides global and domestic investment management solutions managed by its Franklin, Templeton, Mutual Series and Fiduciary Trust investment teams.

Additionally, if elected no later than December 31, 2005, participating directors may defer the payment of their directors' fees and stock awards earned on or after January 1, 2006 under the 2006 Plan and treat the deferred amounts as hypothetical investments in common stock of the Company and/or in Franklin Templeton mutual funds. All contributions of directors' fees and stock awards are fully vested. No additional contributions by such directors, the Company or its subsidiaries are permitted. Participating directors are then credited with the same earnings, gains or losses that they would have incurred if the deferred amounts had been invested in the specific investments, in the specific amounts and for the specific periods as directed by each particular director. Additionally, participating directors who defer their directors' fees and stock awards are credited with notional dividends and other distributions at the same time, in the same form, and in equivalent amounts as dividends and other distributions that are payable from time to time with respect to investments selected by each particular director. Participating directors may change their hypothetical investments on a quarterly basis.
 
On the payout date(s) elected by a participating director, the hypothetical investments are valued and the Company or its subsidiary, as applicable, must pay the director or his/her beneficiary an amount equal to the value of the hypothetical investments. Payouts may be made in a lump sum or periodic payments at the election of the director. If a participating director changes his/her distribution election for amounts previously deferred, any such change shall not take effect for one (1) year from the date of the new election and distributions (or lump sum) shall occur no earlier than five (5) years after the distributions (or lump sum) would have been paid under the prior distribution election (with a series of distributions treated as one payment for this purpose). Accelerated distributions are permitted in limited circumstances, and the 2006 Plan may be terminated by the Company if certain conditions are met, in each case as set forth more fully in the 2006 Plan. The 2006 Plan is intended to comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as such section was enacted by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
 
This brief description of the 2006 Plan is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2006 Plan, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

(a)
            
Deferrals

Exhibit B
. Elections must be made no later than the last day of the deferral election period. The last day of the deferral election period shall be (i) December 31
st
of the calendar year prior to the calendar year in which the Participant will render the services for which he or she will receive any part of the Compensation payable to the Participant during that year or (ii) in the first year in which a Participant first becomes eligible to participate in the Plan, 30 days after the Participant becomes eligible to participate in the Plan. No direct contributions by Participants are required or permitted. An election to defer Compensation shall be effective on the date an eligible Participant delivers a completed deferral election form; provided, however, that, if the Participant delivers another properly completed election to defer Compensation prior to the close of the deferral election period described in this Section 3.1(a), the deferral election on the form bearing the latest date shall control.

(b)
            
Transfer of Account Balance from Separate Deferred Compensation Agreement
. No later than December 31, 2005, Participants may elect (using the form attached hereto as
Exhibit B
) to transfer a deferred compensation account balance from a separate deferred compensation agreement to this Plan. Such transfer of an account balance to this Plan will be considered an amendment and restatement of the prior deferred compensation agreement.
3.2
       
Investment Elections
. In accordance with rules, procedures and options established by the Committee, each Participant shall have the right to direct the investment of his or her Deferred Compensation Account. Each Participant may direct that his or her Deferred Compensation Account be invested in shares of Common Stock and/or one or more Franklin Templeton mutual funds as selected by the Participant; provided, however, that the Committee shall have the authority, in its sole discretion, with or without notice, to change or eliminate one or more of the foregoing investment alternatives available to the Participant at any time. Each Participant shall direct the investment of his or her Deferred Compensation Account by submitting to the Company an Investment Direction in the form set forth at
Exhibit C
. In accordance with procedures established by the Committee, each Participant may change his or her investment directions effective as of the first day of any calendar quarter. Such changes may be made on a validly submitted Investment Direction in the form set forth at
Exhibit C
no fewer than 15 days preceding the effective date of the change. If a Participant fails to provide any investment directions at a time when the Participant has a positive balance in the Deferred Compensation Account, the Company or the Committee shall deem the entire Deferred Compensation Account invested in shares of Company Common Stock. The Company may invest assets allocable to a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account in any manner, in any amount and for any period of time which the Company in its sole discretion may select; but the Company must credit or charge the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account with the same earnings, gains or losses that the Participant would have incurred if the Company had invested the assets allocable to the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account in the specific investments, in the specific amounts and for the specific periods directed by the Participant. If the Plan is determined to be subject to the fiduciary provisions of Part 4 of Title I of ERISA, the Plan shall be treated as a plan described in Section 404(c) of ERISA and Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Section 2550.404c-1, in which Plan fiduciaries may be relieved of liability for any losses which are the direct and necessary result of investment instructions given by a Participant or a Participant's Beneficiary.
3.3
       
Investment Earnings or Losses
. Any amounts credited to a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account may increase or decrease as a result of the Company's investment of such amounts, as described in Section 3.2 above. In a manner consistent with the allocations described in Section 3.2, the investment earnings or losses under this Section 3.3 shall be credited to a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account, as determined in good faith by the Committee. Each Participant and each Participant's Beneficiary understand and agree that they assume all risk in connection with any decrease in the value of the Deferred Compensation Account as invested in accordance with these Sections 3.2 and 3.3.
3.4
       
Contribution of Notional Distributions
. The Deferred Compensation Account of each Participant shall be credited with notional dividends and other distributions at the same time, in the same form, and in equivalent amounts as dividends and other distributions that are payable from time to time with respect to investments selected by the Participant under the Deferred
 
4
 
 
Compensation Account. Any such notional dividends and other distributions shall be valued as of the date on which they are credited to a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account and reallocated to acquire additional shares of the investments selected by a Participant under the Deferred Compensation Account. If such notional dividends and other distributions are credited in a form other than Common Stock or cash, the Committee will determine their value in good faith.
3.5
       
Blackout Periods
. During any "blackout period" (as defined in Regulation BTR promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and referred to hereinafter as "Regulation BTR") in connection with the Plan, if a Participant otherwise would defer receipt of such Participant's Director fees for services rendered as a Director during such blackout period under the Plan and direct the investment of such fees in shares of the Common Stock during such blackout period, the Company shall not cause an actual or deemed investment by the Company of such Director fees into shares of Common Stock during such blackout period, but, rather, shall take all steps necessary or appropriate to suspend such investment during, and until then end of, such blackout period required by Regulation BTR. As soon as practicable following the termination of the blackout period required by Regulation BTR, the Company shall cause an actual or deemed investment of the Director fees in shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.2. Also, during any period that the Director fees are not invested in Common Stock as a result of this Section 3.5, such fees will be credited with interest at the same rate applicable to dividends paid by a Franklin Templeton money market fund
as determined by the Committee.
3.6
       
Valuation of Participant's Deferred Compensation Account
. The value of a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account as of any date shall be determined based on the value of the underlying investments (selected by the Participant) as of the date the value of the Deferred Compensation Account is determined. The value of each underlying investment shall be determined based on the closing sales price for such investment as quoted or otherwise reported on the date of determination (or, if no closing sales price was reported on that date, on the last trading date such closing sales price was reported), as reported in The Wall Street Journal or such other source as the Committee deems reliable.

Scheduled Distribution of Deferred Compensation Accounts
. Subject to Sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6, distribution of a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account shall occur on the dates elected by the Participant pursuant to Section 3.1. In the event the valuation and distribution of all or a portion of a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account shall occur on the same date, the distribution of all or a portion of the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account shall be made as soon as administratively practicable following the valuation of the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account.
4.3
       
Change of Distribution Schedule
. A Participant may elect, at any time, to change his or her distribution date(s), provided that such election shall not take effect for one (1) year from the date of the new election and that under the amended payment schedule, each distribution installment (or lump sum) shall occur no earlier than five (5) years after such installment (or lump sum) would have been paid under the prior distribution schedule, and in conformance with Code Section 409A(a)(4)(C), the regulations thereunder, and any other published interpretive authority, as issued or amended from time to time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of subsequent changes to an election to receive distributions in a series of installment payments, the series of installment payments shall be treated as the entitlement to a single payment. As a result, any change shall not take effect for one (1) year from the date of the new election and distribution installments (or a lump sum payment) shall occur no earlier than five (5) years after the date the first distribution would have been paid under the prior schedule of installment payments.
4.4
       
Accelerated Full or Partial Distributions
. The following amounts shall be deducted from a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account balance.
(a)
            
Unforeseeable Emergency
. In the event of an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, permit distribution to a Participant from his or her Deferred Compensation Account of an amount no greater than the amount necessary to satisfy the emergency plus any taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution.
(b)
            
Domestic Relations Order
. In its sole discretion, the Committee may permit acceleration of the time or schedule of a distribution under the Plan to an individual other than the Plan Participant as may be necessary to fulfill a domestic relations order (as defined in Code Section 414(p)(1)(B)).
(c)
            
Conflict of Interest
. In its sole discretion, the Committee may permit acceleration of the time or schedule of a distribution under the Plan as may be necessary to comply with a certificate of divestiture (as defined in Code Section 1043(b)(2)).
(d)
            
De Minimus Distribution
. In its sole discretion, the Committee may distribute a Participant's entire Deferred Compensation Account to the Participant, provided that (i) the Participant's account balance as of the distribution date is $10,000 or less, (ii) the payment accompanies the termination of the entirety of the Participant's interest in the Plan; and (iii) the payment is made on or before the later of (A) December 31 of the calendar year in which the Participant's Separation from Service occurs or (B) the date 2  months after the Participant's Separation from Service.

(e)
            
Employment Taxes
.

In addition, the Committee may permit acceleration of the time or schedule of a distribution under the Plan as may be necessary to pay the income tax at source on wages imposed under Section 3401 of the Code or the corresponding withholding provisions of applicable state, local, or non-U.S. tax laws as a result of the payment of the FICA tax, and to pay the additional income tax at source on wages attributable to the pyramiding Section 3401 wages and taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the total accelerated distribution to a Participant under this Section 4.4(e) shall not exceed the aggregate amount of FICA taxes and the income tax withholding related to such amount of FICA taxes.
(f)
             
Income Inclusion under Section 409A of the Code
. In its sole discretion, the Committee may permit acceleration of the time or schedule of a distribution under the Plan at any time the Plan fails to meet the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the corresponding regulations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the total accelerated distribution to a Participant under this Section 4.4(f) shall not exceed the amount required to be included as income by the Participant as a result of the failure to meet the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the corresponding regulations.
(g)
            
Dissolution or Bankruptcy
. To the extent permitted under Code Section 409A, the Committee shall have the authority, in its sole discretion, to terminate the Plan and distribute each Participant's entire Deferred Compensation Account to the Participant or, if applicable, his Beneficiary within twelve months of a corporate dissolution taxed under Section 331 of the Code or with the approval of a bankruptcy court pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 503(b)(1)(a).

The calendar year in which the Plan is terminated;
(ii)
           
The calendar year in which the amount of the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture; or
(iii)
          
The calendar year in which distribution of the Participant's entire Deferred Compensation Account is administratively practicable.
(h)

Each Participant's participation in the Plan (and his or her Deferred Compensation Account) will be treated as terminated under this Section 4.4(h) only if all substantially similar arrangements sponsored by the Company are terminated so that all Participants in the Plan and all participants under substantially similar arrangements are required to receive all amounts of compensation

deferred under the terminated arrangements within 12 months of the date of termination of the arrangements.

(iv)
          
The Company does not adopt a new arrangement that would be aggregated with this Plan and any other terminated arrangements under Proposed Regulation Section 1.409A-1(c) if the Participants had participated in both arrangements, at any time within five years following the date of termination of this Plan and the other terminated arrangements.
(j)
             
Other Events and Conditions

4.6
       
Delay of Distributions
. To the extent permitted under Code Section 409A, a scheduled distribution of a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account shall be delayed to a date after the scheduled payment date under any of the following circumstances:
(a)
            
Violation of a Loan Agreement or Similar Contract
. A scheduled distribution of a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account shall be delayed to a date after the scheduled
 
8
 
 
payment date in the event the Company reasonably anticipates that making the distribution will violate a loan agreement or other similar contract to which the Company is a party, and such violation will cause material harm to the Company. The delayed distribution must be made at the earliest date at which the Company reasonably anticipates that making the distribution will not cause such violation, or such violation will not cause material harm to the Company. In addition, the facts and circumstances must indicate that the Company entered into such loan agreement or other similar contract for legitimate business reasons, and not to avoid the restrictions on deferral elections under Code Section 409A.
(b)
            
Payments that would Violate Federal Securities Laws or other Applicable Law
. A scheduled distribution of a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account shall be delayed to a date after the scheduled payment date in the event the Company reasonably anticipates that making the distribution will violate federal securities laws or other applicable law. The delayed distribution must be made at the earliest date at which the Company reasonably anticipates that making the distribution will not cause such violation. For purposes of this Section 4.6(b), making a payment that would cause inclusion in gross income or the application of any penalty provision or other provision of the Code is not considered a violation of applicable law.
(c)
            
Other Events and Conditions
. The Company may delay a scheduled distribution of the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account upon such other events and conditions as may be prescribed in generally applicable guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.

Participant's Rights Unsecured
. The right of Participants and their Beneficiaries to receive a distribution hereunder shall be an unsecured claim against the general assets of the Company, and neither the Participants nor their Beneficiaries shall have any rights in or against any amount credited to their Deferred Compensation Accounts or any other specific assets of the Company, except as otherwise provided in the Trust Agreement. The Deferred Compensation Accounts shall be kept solely as nominal accounts, may be carried in cash or any other liquid assets, may be invested in Common Stock, or may be invested in any other assets as may be selected by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion.

If a Participant's spouse is
 
9
 
 
incapacitated, then the person who holds a power of attorney for the incapacitated spouse or other person authorized to act on behalf of the incapacitated spouse may provide the required spousal consent.

Any benefits not paid from the Trust shall be paid from the Company's general funds, and any benefits paid from the Trust shall be credited against and reduce by a corresponding amount the Company's liability under the Plan. All Trust Funds shall be subject to the claims of general creditors of the Company in the event the Company is insolvent as defined in the Trust Agreement. The obligations of the Company to pay benefits under the Plan and the obligation of the Trustee to pay benefits under the Trust constitute an unfunded, unsecured promise to pay benefits in the future and the Participant and his or her Beneficiaries shall have no greater rights than general creditors of the Company. No Trust may hold assets located outside of the United States nor provide that assets will become restricted to the provision of benefits under the Plan in connection with a change in the Company's financial health.
ARTICLE 7
 
AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION
7.1
       
Amendment
. The Committee shall have the general authority, in its sole discretion, to amend or suspend the Plan at any time and for any reason it deems appropriate; provided however, that no amendment of the Plan may adversely affect a Participant's rights thereunder without such Participant's prior written consent. Any amendment or suspension of the Plan must be pursuant to a written document that is executed by a duly-authorized officer of the Company. Except as required under Code Section 409A, no Deferrals shall be made during any suspension of the Plan or after termination of the Plan.

Automatic Termination of Plan

All members of the Board or the Committee and each and any officer or employee of the Company acting on their behalf shall, to the extent permitted by law, be fully indemnified and protected by the Company in respect of any such action, determination or interpretation.

On December 23, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company"), pursuant to its authority under the Company's 2004 Key Executive Incentive Compensation Plan, established a maximum individual target award of $7,000,000 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 (the "2006 fiscal year") for Mr. Gregory E. Johnson, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. If the Company's operating profit margin is at least 26.35% for the 2006 fiscal year, then Mr. Johnson will be entitled to receive $1,500,000 of the aggregate maximum individual target award. If such operating profit margin is less than 26.35%, then Mr. Johnson will forfeit any right to receive this $1,500,000 portion of the target award. If the average of the percentage growth of diluted earnings per share (as adjusted, if applicable, by a potential one-time repatriation of foreign-based earnings, if approved by the Board of Directors and made in accordance with the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, provided there also should be a special election made pursuant thereto) and pre-tax operating income for the 2006 fiscal year is 25% or greater, then Mr. Johnson will be entitled to receive $5,500,000 of the target award.

Notwithstanding the potential amounts receivable pursuant to the target award, the actual award amounts payable to Mr. Johnson are subject to the Compensation Committee's authority to reduce the award amounts otherwise payable to him. Additionally, the award amounts are payable in cash or common stock at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Franklin Resources, Inc. Announces April 1, 2006 Commencement of Conversion Period for Liquid Yield Option Notes Due 2031 (Zero Coupon-Senior)
 
San Mateo, CA, March 17, 2006  Franklin Resources, Inc. [NYSE:BEN] (the "Company") announced today that commencing April 1, 2006, the Company's Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2031 (Zero Coupon-Senior) ("LYONs") will become eligible for conversion into shares of the Company's common stock, because the closing price of the Company's common stock exceeded the conversion trigger price of $78.96 for at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days in the quarter ending March 31, 2006. Holders may convert their LYONs into shares of the Company's common stock at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on June 30, 2006. Subject to the indenture, the LYONS may be eligible for conversion in subsequent fiscal quarters if, among other things, certain market price conditions are satisfied.
Pursuant to the terms of the indenture under which the LYONs were issued, the LYONs will be convertible at a rate of 9.3604 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of LYONs surrendered for conversion, subject to adjustment as provided in the indenture under which the LYONs were issued in May 2001. Cash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares. Upon conversion, a holder will not receive any cash payment representing accrued original issue discount.
Separately, pursuant to the terms of the indenture, following notice, the Company may redeem all or a portion of the LYONs for cash at any time on or after May 11, 2006, at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture. A holder may surrender for conversion a LYON that has been called for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second business day prior to the redemption date specified by the Company in its notice.
If all currently outstanding LYONs were surrendered for conversion, the aggregate number of shares of common stock issued would be approximately 3,258,000. In accordance
 
 
 
with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04-8, the dilutive effect of this potential issuance has already been reflected in the Company's diluted earnings per share reported in the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2005.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Franklin Resources, Inc. Announces Preliminary Second Quarter Results,
Including Repatriation Income Tax Charge, and Non-Cash Charge Related to Intangibles
 
San Mateo, CA, April 27, 2006
- Franklin Resources, Inc. (Franklin Templeton Investments) (NYSE: BEN) today announced preliminary second quarter results. The company announced net income of $196.5 million, or $0.74 per share diluted, on revenues of $1,254.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. Income taxes for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 included a charge of $111.6 million ($0.42 per share diluted) related to repatriated earnings of the company's foreign subsidiaries under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. As discussed below, net income also reflects a non-cash impairment charge of $68.4 million ($0.17 per share diluted, net of tax) with respect to certain intangible assets of Fiduciary Trust Company International ("Fiduciary"), a company subsidiary, related to the reorganization of that business. In the quarter ended December 31, 2005, net income was $318.0 million, or $1.21 per share diluted, on revenues of $1,181.5 million. For the quarter ended March 31, 2005, net income was $221.3 million, or $0.85 per share diluted, on revenues of $1,051.2 million.
 
Operating income for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 was $349.8 million, as compared to $404.6 million for the prior quarter and $273.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2005
,
a decrease of 14% for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 over the prior quarter and an increase of 28% over the same quarter in the prior year. The company's non-operating income for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 included $55.4 million of investment and other income, net, as compared to $32.4 million in the prior quarter and $38.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2005.
 
The company currently believes that it needs to recognize in the quarter ended March 31, 2006 an impairment of certain Fiduciary acquisition-related intangible assets, which were carried at $155.1 million at December 31, 2005. At the date of this release, management currently estimates the impairment charge to be $68.4 million and has reflected this as a charge in the second quarter. However, management's evaluation is still ongoing and the possibility exists that all or a portion of the charge may relate to the first fiscal quarter of 2006. The company currently expects to complete its analysis on or prior to the filing of its Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2006.
 
 
 
 
Assets under management by the company's subsidiaries were $491.6 billion at March 31, 2006, as compared to $464.8 billion at December 31, 2005 and $412.1 billion at March 31, 2005. Simple monthly average assets under management during the quarter ended March 31, 2006 were $481.2 billion compared to $453.3 billion in the preceding quarter and $407.4 billion in the same quarter a year ago. Equity assets increased to 60% of total assets under management at March 31, 2006, as compared to 59% for the previous quarter and 57% at March 31, 2005. Fixed-income assets comprised 22% of total assets under management at March 31, 2006, as compared to 23% for the previous quarter and 24% at March 31, 2005. Hybrid assets accounted for 17% of total assets under management at March 31, 2006, December 31, 2005 and March 31, 2005. Sales exceeded redemptions by $2.5 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, as compared to $5.8 billion for the prior quarter and $11.5 billion for the comparable quarter a year ago.

UPDATED AWARD DOCUMENTS FOR RESTRICTED FUND UNIT AWARDS.
Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as exhibits to its Form 8-K, dated November 3, 2005, copies of its forms of Notices of Restricted Fund Unit Award and Restricted Fund Unit Award Agreements (collectively, "Award Documents") with respect to incentive awards paid in shares of investment companies in the Franklin Templeton Investments funds pursuant to the terms of the Company's Amended and Restated Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (the "AIP"), which incentive awards are subject to restrictions and a vesting schedule determined to be appropriate by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company. The Company recently adopted updated forms of its Award Documents and, although the material terms of the Award Documents have not changed, copies of the updated standard forms of a Notice of Restricted Fund Unit Award and Restricted Fund Unit Award Agreement for awards to certain investment management personnel and, potentially, others ("Standard IM Award Documents"), and updated forms of a Notice of Restricted Fund Unit Award and Restricted Fund Unit Award Agreement in the case of awards made to certain other investment management personnel and, potentially, others ("Other IM Award Documents") are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively (collectively, "Updated AIP Award Documents"). The forms of Other IM Award Documents differ from the forms of Standard IM Award Documents with regard to the timing of the vesting of restricted fund units credited as a result of dividends paid from time to time with respect to the shares of the applicable class of a series of an investment company in the Franklin Templeton Investments funds issuable for each restricted fund unit.
The following is a summary of the principal terms of the Updated AIP Award Documents, which is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively:
The Company may issue to participants, including executive officers of the Company (hereinafter, each "Participant"), restricted fund units ("Units") as set forth in the Notice of Restricted Fund Unit Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Participant as owner thereof as set forth in the Restricted Fund Unit Award Agreement.
. The Units may not be transferred by Participant in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Participant may designate a beneficiary of the Units in the event of Participant's death. The terms of the Restricted Fund Unit Award Agreement shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and transferees of Participant.
Transfer Restrictions
. The Units shall become vested in accordance with the vesting schedule in the Notice of Restricted Fund Unit Award so long as Participant maintains a continuous status as an employee of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company. If Participant ceases to maintain a continuous status as an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries for any reason other than death or disability, all Units to the extent not yet vested on the date Participant ceases to be an employee shall be forfeited by Participant. If Participant dies or in the event of termination of Participant's continuous status as an employee as a result of disability (as determined by the Board in accordance with the policies of the Company) while an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, the Units awarded shall become fully vested as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board, "disability" means that Participant ceases to be an employee on account of disability as a result of which Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long-term disability policy.
Vesting
 
In the event of a proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company or of a merger or corporate combination of the Company (a "Transaction") in which the successor entity does not agree to assume the award of restricted fund units or substitute an equivalent award, the Company shall make a determination as to the equitable treatment of the award and shall notify Participant of such treatment no later than ten (10) days prior to the consummation of such proposed Transaction. In the event the award is not assumed in connection with a Transaction, the award will terminate upon the consummation of such proposed Transaction.
. Upon each vesting date, the value of one share of the applicable class of a series of an investment company in the Franklin Templeton Investments funds ("fund") shall be issuable for each Unit that vests on such date (the "Shares"), subject to the terms and provisions of the AIP, the Notice of Restricted Fund Unit Award and the Restricted Fund Unit Award Agreement. Any fractional Unit that vests on a particular date shall be converted into the value of a fractional Share. Thereafter, the Company will transfer to a broker and/or dealer or equivalent entity authorized to effect transactions in such fund shares for the account of others (the "Broker/Dealer") in the jurisdiction of Participant's employment, or cause such Broker/Dealer to receive or otherwise credit, the aggregate vested value of such Shares for the benefit of such Participant. The Broker/Dealer will then cause the Shares to be acquired on behalf of Participant and, thereafter, the Broker/Dealer will transfer such Shares to Participant. Any Shares in a fund shall be advisor class shares or equivalent, if available; otherwise, they shall be Class A shares or equivalent or, if unavailable, the Company shall make a determination as to the class of Shares. Notwithstanding the above, the Company may, in its discretion, pay to Participant all or a portion of any vested Units in cash in an amount equal to the vested value of the Shares. The Shares or equivalent cash payment will be issued to Participant as soon as practicable after the vesting date, but in any event, within the period ending on the later to occur of the date that is two and a half (2

/
2
) months from the end of (i) Participant's tax year that includes the applicable vesting date, or (ii) the Company's tax year that includes the applicable vesting date.
In the event any one or more of the funds ceases to exist, the shares of such fund represented by Units subject to the award shall be replaced with shares of a comparable fund in the Franklin Templeton Investments funds which preserves the compensation element of the award existing at the time the fund ceases to exist. The determination of fund comparability shall be made by the Compensation Committee of the Board and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive.
. Participant shall not have any right in, to or with respect to any of the Shares (including any voting rights) issuable under the award until the award is settled by the issuance of such Shares to Participant.
Right To Shares
. Any dividends that are paid from time to time with respect to the Shares represented by the Units shall be deemed reinvested in the Shares with respect to which the dividend was paid and shall be credited to Participant as additional Units. Such additional Units shall vest in accordance with the terms of the applicable Standard IM Award Documents or Other IM Award Documents.
Dividends

The Company previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as exhibits to certain of its Form 8-Ks copies of its forms of Notices of Restricted Stock Award and Restricted Stock Award Agreements and Notices of Restricted Stock Unit Award and Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements (collectively, "Prior Award Documents").

All shares of Stock issued shall be deemed issued to Plan Participant as fully paid and nonassessable shares, and, subject to the restrictions set forth in the 2002 Plan and the Restricted Stock Award Agreement, Plan Participant shall have all rights of a stockholder with respect thereto, including the right to vote, to receive dividends (including stock dividends), to participate in stock splits or other recapitalizations, and to exchange such shares in a tender offer, merger, consolidation or other reorganization.
. No Stock issued to Plan Participant shall be sold, transferred by gift, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise transferred or disposed of by Plan Participant prior to the date on which it becomes vested, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Plan Participant is not precluded, however, from exchanging the Stock awarded pursuant to a cash or stock tender offer, merger, reorganization or consolidation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any securities (including stock dividends and stock splits) received with respect to shares of Stock which are not yet vested shall be subject to the provisions of the Restricted Stock Award Agreement in the same manner and shall become fully vested at the same time as the Stock with respect to which such additional securities were issued.
Transfer Restrictions

Plan Participant's interest in the Stock awarded shall become vested and nonforfeitable in accordance with the vesting schedule in the Notice of Restricted Stock Award so long as Plan Participant maintains a continuous status as an employee (as such term is defined in the 2002 Plan) of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company. If Plan Participant ceases to maintain a continuous status as an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries for any reason other than death or disability, all shares of Stock to the extent not yet vested on the date Plan Participant ceases to be an employee shall be forfeited by Plan Participant. If Plan Participant dies or in the event of termination of Plan Participant's continuous status as an employee as a result of disability (as determined by the Board in accordance with the policies of the Company) while an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, Plan Participant's interest in all shares of Stock awarded shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board, "disability" means that Plan Participant ceases to be an employee on account of disability as a result of which Plan Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long-term disability policy.

Restricted Stock Unit Awards

Unless changed by the Board, "disability" means that Plan Participant ceases to be an employee on account of disability as a result of which Plan Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long-term disability policy.

Notwithstanding the above, the Company may, in its discretion, pay to Plan Participant all or a portion of any vested Stock Units in cash in an amount equal to the shares of Stock, less any tax or other withholding obligations.
. Plan Participant shall not have any right in, to or with respect to any of the shares of Stock (including any voting rights or rights with respect to dividends paid on the Stock) issuable for a Stock Unit until the award is settled by the issuance of such shares of Stock to Plan Participant.

In the event the Award is not assumed in connection with a Transaction, the Award will terminate upon the consummation of such proposed Transaction.
4. .
Conversion of Units and Issuance of Fund Shares
(a) Upon each vesting date, the value of one share of the applicable class of a series of an investment company in the Franklin Templeton Investments funds ("fund") shall be issuable for each Unit that vests on such date (the "Shares"), subject to the terms and provisions of the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement. Any fractional Unit that vests on a particular date shall be converted into the value of a fractional Share. Thereafter, the Company will transfer to a broker and/or dealer or equivalent entity authorized to effect transactions in such fund shares for the account of others (the "Broker/Dealer") in the jurisdiction of Participant's employment, or cause such Broker/Dealer to receive or otherwise credit, the aggregate Vested Value (as defined below) of such Shares for the benefit of such Participant. The Broker/Dealer will then cause the Shares to be acquired on behalf of Participant and, thereafter, the Broker/Dealer will transfer such Shares to Participant. Any Shares in a fund shall be advisor class shares or equivalent, if available; otherwise, they shall be Class A shares or equivalent or, if unavailable, the Company shall make a determination as to the class of Shares. Notwithstanding the above, the Company may, in its discretion, pay to Participant all or a portion of any vested Units in cash in an amount equal to the Vested Value of the Shares. The Shares or equivalent cash payment will be issued to Participant as soon as practicable after the vesting date, but in any event, within the period ending on the later to occur of the date that is two and a half (2
 1
/
2
) months from the end of (i) Participant's tax year that includes the applicable vesting date, or (ii) the Company's tax year that includes the applicable vesting date.
(b) "Vested Value" shall mean: (i) with regard to Shares of closed-end funds, the number of vested Shares multiplied by the closing price per share of the applicable fund on the primary stock exchange or NASDAQ stock market, as applicable, on which such fund then trades on the date the underlying Units vested (or, if such date is not a trading day, on the last trading day prior to such date), less any required tax or other withholding; or (ii) with regard to non-closed end funds, the aggregate Net Asset Value (as defined below) of the Shares on the date the underlying Units vested, less any required tax or other withholding obligations.
 
(c) "Net Asset Value" shall mean the net asset value per share of the applicable non-closed end fund calculated on the date of determination as detailed in the fund's prospectus (or, if the date of determination is not a trading day, on the last trading day prior to the date of determination).
(d) In the event any one or more of the funds set forth in the Notice of Award ceases to exist, the shares of such fund represented by Units subject to the Award shall be replaced with shares of a comparable fund in the Franklin Templeton Investments funds which preserves the compensation element of the Award existing at the time the fund ceases to exist. The determination of fund comparability shall be made by the Committee and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive.
5. .
Right to Shares; Dividends
(a) Except as set forth in paragraph 5(b) of this Agreement, Participant shall not have any right in, to or with respect to any of the Shares (including any voting rights) issuable under the Award until the Award is settled by the issuance of such Shares to Participant.
(b) Any dividends that are paid from time to time with respect to the Shares represented by the Units shall be deemed reinvested in the Shares with respect to which the dividend was paid, shall be credited to Participant as additional Units and shall vest upon the same vesting date (in accordance with the Notice of Award) of the corresponding Units pursuant to which the dividends were originally paid.
6. .
Withholding of Taxes
(a) . Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by Participant in connection with the Units awarded, regardless of any action the Company or any of its subsidiaries takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Units awarded. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of the Units awarded or the subsequent sale of any of the Shares. The Company and its subsidiaries do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the Award to reduce or eliminate Participant's tax liability.
General
(b) . Prior to any event in connection with the Units awarded (e.g., vesting) that the Company determines may result in any tax withholding obligation, whether United States federal, state or local taxes and including any employment tax obligation (the "Tax Withholding Obligation"), Participant must arrange for the satisfaction of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company, including by means of one of the following methods:
Payment of Withholding Taxes
(i) Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (ii) below, Participant authorizes the Company (in the exercise of its sole discretion) to withhold the number of Units sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation, provided that the Company shall withhold only the amount of Units necessary to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Unit withholding will result in issuance of a lower number of Shares or amount of equivalent cash, as applicable, to Participant.
By Unit Withholding.
(ii) . At any time not less than five (5) business days (or such fewer number of days as determined by the Committee or its designee) before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises (, a vesting date), Participant may elect to satisfy the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation by delivering to the Company an amount that
By Check, Wire Transfer or Other Means
e.g.
 
the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation by (x) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (y) delivery of a certified check payable to the Company, or (z) such other means as specified from time to time by the Committee or its designee.
7. . This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. Nothing contained in the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be interpreted as imposing any liability on the Company or the Committee in favor of Participant or any purchaser or other transferee of Units with respect to any loss, cost or expense which such Participant, purchaser or other transferee may incur in connection with, or arising out of any transaction involving, any Units subject to the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement.
Successors
8. . None of the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement are intended to provide for an elective deferral of compensation that would be subject to Section 409A ("Section 409A") of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Company reserves the right, to the extent the Company deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, to unilaterally amend or modify the AIP, the Notice of Award and/or this Agreement to ensure that no awards (including, without limitation, the Units) become subject to the requirements of Section 409A, provided, however, that the Company makes no representation that the Units are not subject to Section 409A nor makes any undertaking to preclude Section 409A from applying to the Units.
No Compensation Deferrals
9. . The terms of the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement are intended by the Company and Participant to be the final expression of their agreement with respect to the Units and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous agreement. The Company and Participant further intend that the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall constitute the complete and exclusive statement of their terms and that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may be introduced in any arbitration, judicial, administrative or other legal proceeding involving the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement. Accordingly, the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement contain the entire understanding between the parties and supersede all prior oral, written and implied agreements, understandings, commitments and practices among the parties.
Integration
10. . Any failure to enforce any terms or conditions of the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement by the Company or by Participant shall not be deemed a waiver of that term or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power for all or any other times.
Waivers
11. . If any provision of the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision thereof; and the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if neither of them included such provision.
Severability of Provisions
12. . This Agreement and the Notice of Award are administered and interpreted by the Committee and the Committee has full and exclusive discretion to interpret and administer this Agreement and the Notice of Award. All actions, interpretations and decisions of the Committee are conclusive and binding on all persons, and will be given the maximum possible deference allowed by law.
Committee Decisions Conclusive
 
13. . To the extent permitted by law, any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Notice of Award and the AIP, including the meaning or interpretation thereof, shall be resolved solely by arbitration before an arbitrator selected in accordance with the Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures of the American Arbitration Association. The location for the arbitration shall be in the county or comparable jurisdiction of Participant's employment. Judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each party shall pay an equal share of the arbitrator's fees, unless applicable law requires the Company to pay all or a greater share of the fees and costs. All statutes of limitation which would otherwise be applicable shall apply to any arbitration proceeding under this paragraph. Neither Participant nor the Company will have the right to participate in a class, representative or collective action, as a class representative, class member or an opt-in party, act as a private attorney general, or join or consolidate claims with claims of any other person or entity, with respect to any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Notice of Award and the AIP. The provisions of this paragraph are intended by Participant and the Company to be exclusive for all purposes and applicable to any and all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Notice of Award and the AIP. The arbitrator who hears and decides any dispute shall have jurisdiction and authority only to award compensatory damages to make whole a person or entity sustaining foreseeable economic damages, and shall not have jurisdiction and authority to make any other award of any type, including, without limitation, punitive damages, unforeseeable economic damage, damages for pain, suffering or emotional distress, or any other kind or form of damages, unless such other award is available as a matter of law. The remedy, if any, awarded by the arbitrator shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any dispute which is subject to arbitration under this paragraph.
Mandatory Arbitration
14. . The Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced according to the laws of the State of Delaware to the extent not preempted by the federal laws of the United States of America.

(b) "Vested Value" shall mean: (i) with regard to Shares of closed-end funds, the number of vested Shares multiplied by the closing price per share of the applicable fund on the primary stock exchange or NASDAQ stock market, as applicable, on which such fund then trades on the date the underlying Units vested (or, if such date is not a trading day, on the last trading day prior to such date), less any required tax or other withholding; or (ii) with regard to non-closed end funds, the aggregate Net Asset Value (as defined below) of the Shares on the date the underlying Units vested, less any required tax or other withholding obligations.
(c) "Net Asset Value" shall mean the net asset value per share of the applicable non-closed end fund calculated on the date of determination as detailed in the fund's prospectus (or, if the date of determination is not a trading day, on the last trading day prior to the date of determination).
 
(d) In the event any one or more of the funds set forth in the Notice of Award ceases to exist, the shares of such fund represented by Units subject to the Award shall be replaced with shares of a comparable fund in the Franklin Templeton Investments funds which preserves the compensation element of the Award existing at the time the fund ceases to exist. The determination of fund comparability shall be made by the Committee and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive.
5. .
Right to Shares; Dividends

(b) Any dividends that are paid from time to time with respect to the Shares represented by the Units shall be deemed reinvested in the Shares with respect to which the dividend was paid and shall be credited to Participant as additional Units. All such additional Units shall vest upon the next immediately following vesting date (in accordance with the Notice of Award).
6. .
Withholding of Taxes
(a) . Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by Participant in connection with the Units awarded, regardless of any action the Company or any of its subsidiaries takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Units awarded. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of the Units awarded or the subsequent sale of any of the Shares. The Company and its subsidiaries do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the Award to reduce or eliminate Participant's tax liability.
General
(b). Prior to any event in connection with the Units awarded (, vesting) that the Company determines may result in any tax withholding obligation, whether United States federal, state or local taxes and including any employment tax obligation (the "Tax Withholding Obligation"), Participant must arrange for the satisfaction of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company, including by means of one of the following methods:
Payment of Withholding Taxes
e.g.
(i) Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (ii) below, Participant authorizes the Company (in the exercise of its sole discretion) to withhold the number of Units sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation, provided that the Company shall withhold only the amount of Units necessary to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Unit withholding will result in issuance of a lower number of Shares or amount of equivalent cash, as applicable, to Participant.
By Unit Withholding.
(ii) . At any time not less than five (5) business days (or such fewer number of days as determined by the Committee or its designee) before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises (, a vesting date), Participant may elect to satisfy the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation by delivering to the Company an amount that the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation by (x) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (y) delivery of a certified check payable to the Company, or (z) such other means as specified from time to time by the Committee or its designee.
By Check, Wire Transfer or Other Means
e.g.
 
7. . This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. Nothing contained in the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be interpreted as imposing any liability on the Company or the Committee in favor of Participant or any purchaser or other transferee of Units with respect to any loss, cost or expense which such Participant, purchaser or other transferee may incur in connection with, or arising out of any transaction involving, any Units subject to the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement.
Successors
8. . None of the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement are intended to provide for an elective deferral of compensation that would be subject to Section 409A ("Section 409A") of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Company reserves the right, to the extent the Company deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, to unilaterally amend or modify the AIP, the Notice of Award and/or this Agreement to ensure that no awards (including, without limitation, the Units) become subject to the requirements of Section 409A, provided, however, that the Company makes no representation that the Units are not subject to Section 409A nor makes any undertaking to preclude Section 409A from applying to the Units.
No Compensation Deferrals
9. . The terms of the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement are intended by the Company and Participant to be the final expression of their agreement with respect to the Units and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous agreement. The Company and Participant further intend that the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall constitute the complete and exclusive statement of their terms and that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may be introduced in any arbitration, judicial, administrative or other legal proceeding involving the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement. Accordingly, the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement contain the entire understanding between the parties and supersede all prior oral, written and implied agreements, understandings, commitments and practices among the parties.
Integration
10. . Any failure to enforce any terms or conditions of the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement by the Company or by Participant shall not be deemed a waiver of that term or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power for all or any other times.
Waivers
11. . If any provision of the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision thereof; and the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if neither of them included such provision.
Severability of Provisions
12. . This Agreement and the Notice of Award are administered and interpreted by the Committee and the Committee has full and exclusive discretion to interpret and administer this Agreement and the Notice of Award. All actions, interpretations and decisions of the Committee are conclusive and binding on all persons, and will be given the maximum possible deference allowed by law.
Committee Decisions Conclusive
13. . To the extent permitted by law, any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Notice of Award and the AIP, including the meaning or interpretation thereof, shall be resolved solely by arbitration before an arbitrator selected in accordance with the Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures of the American Arbitration Association. The location for the arbitration shall be in the county or comparable jurisdiction of Participant's employment. Judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each party shall pay an equal share of the arbitrator's fees, unless applicable law requires the Company to pay all or a greater share of the fees and costs. All statutes of limitation which would otherwise be applicable shall apply to any arbitration proceeding under this paragraph. Neither Participant nor the Company will have the right to
Mandatory Arbitration
 
participate in a class, representative or collective action, as a class representative, class member or an opt-in party, act as a private attorney general, or join or consolidate claims with claims of any other person or entity, with respect to any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Notice of Award and the AIP. The provisions of this paragraph are intended by Participant and the Company to be exclusive for all purposes and applicable to any and all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Notice of Award and the AIP. The arbitrator who hears and decides any dispute shall have jurisdiction and authority only to award compensatory damages to make whole a person or entity sustaining foreseeable economic damages, and shall not have jurisdiction and authority to make any other award of any type, including, without limitation, punitive damages, unforeseeable economic damage, damages for pain, suffering or emotional distress, or any other kind or form of damages, unless such other award is available as a matter of law. The remedy, if any, awarded by the arbitrator shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any dispute which is subject to arbitration under this paragraph.
14. . The Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced according to the laws of the State of Delaware to the extent not preempted by the federal laws of the United States of America.

Subject to Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee (as defined in the 2002 Plan) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as defined in the 2002 Plan) and other limitations set forth in the Award and the 2002 Plan, the Shares shall vest in accordance with the following schedule:
 
Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Shares subject to this Award shall vest only by Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and that such status is at the will of the Company or the applicable Subsidiary (not through the act of being hired, being granted this Award or acquiring Shares hereunder). Participant further acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this Award nor in the 2002 Plan, which is incorporated herein by this reference, affects the Company's, or a Subsidiary's, right to terminate, or to change the terms of, Participant's employment at any time, with or without cause.
Participant acknowledges that, from time to time, the Company may be in a "Blackout Period" and/or subject to applicable securities laws that could subject Participant to liability for engaging in any transaction involving the sale of the Company's shares. Participant further acknowledges and agrees that, prior to the sale of any Shares acquired under this Award, it is Participant's responsibility to determine whether or not such sale of Shares will subject Participant to liability under insider trading rules or other applicable securities laws.
 
Participant understands that the Award is subject to Participant's consent to access, and acknowledgement of having accessed, the 2002 Plan prospectus in connection with the Form S-8 registration statement for the 2002 Plan, any updates thereto, the 2002 Plan, the Award Agreement and this Notice of Award (collectively, the "2002 Plan Documents") in electronic form through the People Page on the Company's Intranet. By signing below, Participant hereby: (i) consents to access electronic copies (instead of receiving paper copies) of the 2002 Plan Documents via the Company's Intranet; (ii) represents that Participant has access to the Company's Intranet; (iii) acknowledges receipt of electronic copies, or that Participant is already in possession of paper copies, of the 2002 Plan Documents and the Company's most recent annual report to stockholders; and (iv) acknowledges that Participant is familiar with and has accepted the Award subject to the terms and provisions of the 2002 Plan Documents.
Participant may receive, without charge, upon written or oral request, paper copies of any or all of the 2002 Plan Documents, documents incorporated by reference in the Form S-8 registration statement for the 2002 Plan, and the Company's most recent annual report to stockholders by requesting them from Stock Administration at the Company, One Franklin Parkway, San Mateo, CA 94403-1906. Telephone (650) 525-8037. Participant may also withdraw Participant's consent to receive any or all documents electronically by notifying Stock Administration at the above address in writing.
In the event of Participant's death, Participant hereby designates the following as Participant's beneficiary(ies) to receive all payments and Shares due to Participant pursuant to this Award. Please note that this designation applies only to this Award and not to any prior awards or grants under the 2002 Plan. This designation shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and transferees of Participant only in jurisdictions where such beneficiary designations are enforceable under local law.
 
 
By Participant's electronic signature and by the signature of the Company's representative below, Participant and the Company agree that the Award is granted under and governed by the terms and conditions of the 2002 Plan, this Notice of Award and the Award Agreement.
 
 
 
This Restricted Stock Award Agreement, together with any Appendix(es) attached hereto (hereinafter, collectively, the "Agreement"), is made as of the Award Date set forth in the Notice of Restricted Stock Award (the "Notice of Award") between Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") and the Participant named therein ("Participant").
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors and stockholders of the Company have adopted the Franklin Resources, Inc. 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (the "2002 Plan"), authorizing the grant of common stock of the Company ("Stock") to eligible individuals as an incentive in connection with the performance of services for the Company and its Subsidiaries, as defined in the 2002 Plan, which is incorporated herein by this reference (capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the same meaning as set forth in the 2002 Plan or the Notice of Award, as applicable); and
WHEREAS, the Company recognizes the efforts of Participant on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries and desires to motivate Participant in Participant's work and provide an inducement to remain in the service of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and
WHEREAS, the Company has determined that it would be to the advantage and in the interest of the Company and its stockholders to award the Stock provided for in this Agreement and the Notice of Award to Participant, subject to certain restrictions, as an incentive for increased efforts and successful achievements;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
1. . The Company is issuing to Participant shares of Stock as set forth in the Notice of Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Participant as owner thereof as set forth in this Agreement. Such shares are being issued in book entry form and maintained on the books of the Bank of New York, the Company's transfer agent, or any successor thereto. All shares of Stock issued hereunder shall be deemed issued to Participant as fully paid and non assessable shares, and, subject to the restrictions set forth in the 2002 Plan and this Agreement, Participant shall have all rights of a stockholder with respect thereto, including the right to vote, to receive dividends (including stock dividends), to participate in stock splits or other recapitalizations, and to exchange such shares in a tender offer, merger, consolidation or other reorganization. The Company shall pay any applicable stock transfer taxes. Participant hereby acknowledges that Participant is acquiring the Stock issued hereunder for investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof, and that Participant does not intend to subdivide Participant's interest in the Stock with any other person.
Restricted Stock Award
2. .
Transfer Restriction
(a) No Stock issued to Participant hereunder shall be sold, transferred by gift, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise transferred or disposed of by Participant prior to the date on which it becomes vested under paragraph 3, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This paragraph shall not preclude Participant from exchanging the Stock awarded hereunder pursuant to a cash or
 
stock tender offer, merger, reorganization or consolidation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any securities (including stock dividends and stock splits) received with respect to shares of Stock which are not yet vested under paragraph 3 shall be subject to the provisions of this Agreement in the same manner and shall become fully vested at the same time as the Stock with respect to which such additional securities were issued.
(b) Participant acknowledges that, from time to time, the Company may be in a "Blackout Period" and/or subject to applicable securities laws that could subject Participant to liability for engaging in any transaction involving the sale of the Company's shares. Participant further acknowledges and agrees that, prior to the sale of any shares acquired under this Award, it is Participant's responsibility to determine whether or not such sale of shares will subject Participant to liability under insider trading rules or other applicable securities laws.
3. .
Vesting
(a) Participant's interest in the Stock awarded under paragraph 1 shall become vested and nonforfeitable in accordance with the Vesting Schedule in the Notice of Award so long as Participant maintains a Continuous Status as an Employee of the Company or a Subsidiary. Upon vesting, the Company shall, within thirty (30) days of such vesting, deliver to Participant the certificates evidencing the nonforfeitable shares (free of restrictive legends on such stock certificates), provided the withholding requirements of paragraph 4 have been satisfied. Alternatively, provided the withholding requirements of paragraph 4 have been satisfied, the Committee may permit or require that such nonforfeitable shares of Stock (free of the restrictive notations on shares of Stock issued in book-entry form) be deposited directly with a brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose or to a designated agent of the Company, and the Committee may utilize electronic or automated methods of share transfer.
(b) If Participant ceases to maintain a Continuous Status as an Employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason other than death or disability (as described in subparagraph (c)), all shares of Stock to the extent not yet vested under subparagraph (a) on the date Participant ceases to be an employee shall be forfeited by Participant without payment of any consideration to Participant therefor. Any shares of Stock so forfeited shall be canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares, to be held for future distributions under the Company's 2002 Plan.
(c) If Participant dies or in the event of termination of Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee as a result of disability (as determined by the Board in accordance with the policies of the Company) while an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Participant's interest in all shares of Stock awarded hereunder shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board, "disability" means that Participant ceases to be an employee on account of disability as a result of which Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long-term disability policy.
4. .
Withholding of Taxes
(a) . Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by Participant in connection with the Stock awarded, regardless of any action the Company or any of its Subsidiaries takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Stock awarded. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of the Stock awarded or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Stock. The Company and its Subsidiaries do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the Award to reduce or eliminate Participant's tax liability.
General
 
(b) . Prior to any event in connection with the Stock awarded (, vesting) that the Company determines may result in any tax withholding obligation, whether United States federal, state or local taxes and including any employment tax obligation (the "Tax Withholding Obligation"), Participant must arrange for the satisfaction of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company, including by means of one of the following methods:
Payment of Withholding Taxes
e.g.
(i) Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, Participant authorizes the Company (in the exercise of its sole discretion) to withhold from those unrestricted shares of Stock to be delivered to Participant upon vesting under paragraph 3 above the whole number of shares sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation, provided that the Company shall withhold only the amount of shares necessary to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Share withholding will result in the delivery of a lower number of unrestricted shares of Stock to Participant. Share withholding will generally be used to satisfy the tax liability of individuals subject to the short-swing profit restrictions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
By Share Withholding.
(ii) . Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, and provided that the terms of this clause (ii) do not violate Section 13(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Participant's acceptance of the Stock awarded constitutes Participant's instruction and authorization to the Company and any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose to sell on Participant's behalf a whole number of shares from those unrestricted shares of Stock to be delivered to Participant upon vesting under paragraph 3 above as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Such shares will be sold on the day such Tax Withholding Obligation arises (, a vesting date) or as soon thereafter as practicable. Participant will be responsible for all broker's fees and other costs of sale, and Participant agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale. To the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed the Tax Withholding Obligation, the Company agrees to pay such excess in cash to Participant. Participant acknowledges that the Company or its designee is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price, and that the proceeds of any such sale may not be sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, Participant agrees to pay to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the sale of shares described above.
By Sale of Shares
e.g.
(iii) . At any time not less than five (5) business days (or such fewer number of days as determined by the Committee or its designee) before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises (, a vesting date), Participant may elect to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by delivering to the Company an amount that the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by (x) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (y) delivery of a certified check payable to the Company, or (z) such other means as specified from time to time by the Committee or its designee.
By Check, Wire Transfer or Other Means
e.g.
5. . This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. Nothing contained in the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be interpreted as imposing any liability on the Company or the Committee in favor of Participant or any purchaser or other
Successors
 
transferee of Stock with respect to any loss, cost or expense which such Participant, purchaser or other transferee may incur in connection with, or arising out of any transaction involving, any shares of Stock subject to the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement.
6. . The terms of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement are intended by the Company and Participant to be the final expression of their agreement with respect to the shares of Stock and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous agreement. The Company and Participant further intend that the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall constitute the complete and exclusive statement of their terms and that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may be introduced in any arbitration, judicial, administrative or other legal proceeding involving the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement. Accordingly, the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement contain the entire understanding between the parties and supersede all prior oral, written and implied agreements, understandings, commitments and practices among the parties.
Integration
7. . Any failure to enforce any terms or conditions of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement by the Company or by Participant shall not be deemed a waiver of that term or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power for all or any other times.
Waivers
8. . If any provision of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision thereof; and the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if none of them included such provision.
Severability of Provisions
9. . All decisions of the Committee arising under the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be conclusive.
Committee Decisions Conclusive
10. . To the extent permitted by law, any dispute arising out of or relating to the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement, including the meaning or interpretation thereof, shall be resolved solely by arbitration before an arbitrator selected in accordance with the Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures of the American Arbitration Association. The location for the arbitration shall be in the county or comparable jurisdiction of Participant's employment. Judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each party shall pay an equal share of the arbitrator's fees, unless applicable law requires the Company to pay all or a greater share of the fees and costs. All statutes of limitation which would otherwise be applicable shall apply to any arbitration proceeding under this paragraph. Neither Participant nor the Company will have the right to participate in a class, representative or collective action, as a class representative, class member or an opt-in party, act as a private attorney general, or join or consolidate claims with claims of any other person or entity, with respect to any dispute arising out of or relating to the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement. The provisions of this paragraph are intended by Participant and the Company to be exclusive for all purposes and applicable to any and all disputes arising out of or relating to the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement.

Any Units so forfeited shall be canceled and any shares considered issuable pursuant to such Units, if applicable, shall be returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares, to be held for future distributions under the Company's 2002 Plan.
(c) If Participant dies or in the event of termination of Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee as a result of disability (as determined by the Board in accordance with the policies of the Company) while an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Units awarded hereunder shall become fully vested as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board, "disability" means that Participant ceases to be an employee on account of disability as a result of which Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long-term disability policy.
4. . Upon each vesting date, one share of common stock ("Stock") shall be issuable for each Unit that vests on such date, subject to the terms and provisions of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement. Upon satisfaction of any required tax or other withholding obligations as set forth in paragraph 6 of this Agreement, the shares of Stock will be issued to Participant (as evidenced by the appropriate entry in the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) as soon as practicable after the vesting date, but in any event, within the period ending on the later to occur of the date that is two and a half (2

) months from the end of (i) Participant's tax year that includes the applicable vesting date, or (ii) the Company's tax year that includes the applicable vesting date. Any fractional Unit remaining after all Units under this Award are fully vested shall be discarded and a fractional share of Stock shall not be issued at vesting of the fractional Unit. Notwithstanding the above, the Company may, in its discretion, pay to Participant all or a portion of any vested Units in cash in an amount equal to the shares of Stock, less any tax or other withholding obligations set forth in paragraph 6 of this Agreement.
5. . Participant shall not have any right in, to or with respect to any of the shares of Stock (including any voting rights or rights with respect to dividends paid on the Stock) issuable for a Unit under the Award until the Award is settled by the issuance of such shares of Stock to Participant.
Right to Shares
 
6. .
Withholding of Taxes
(a) . Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by Participant in connection with Units awarded, regardless of any action the Company or any of its Subsidiaries takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with Units awarded. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of Units awarded or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Stock. The Company and its Subsidiaries do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the Award to reduce or eliminate Participant's tax liability.
General
(b) . Prior to any event in connection with Units awarded (, vesting) that the Company determines may result in any tax withholding obligation, whether United States federal, state or local taxes and including any employment tax obligation (the "Tax Withholding Obligation"), Participant must arrange for the satisfaction of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company, including by means of one of the following methods:
Payment of Withholding Taxes
e.g.
(i) Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, Participant authorizes the Company (in the exercise of its sole discretion) to withhold from those shares of Stock issuable to Participant the whole number of shares sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation, provided that the Company shall withhold only the amount of shares necessary to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Share withholding will result in issuance of a lower number of shares of Stock to Participant. Share withholding will generally be used to satisfy the tax liability of individuals subject to the short-swing profit restrictions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
By Share Withholding.
(ii) . Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, and provided that the terms of this clause (ii) do not violate Section 13(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Participant's acceptance of the Award constitutes Participant's instruction and authorization to the Company and any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose to sell on Participant's behalf a whole number of shares from those shares of Stock issuable to Participant as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Such shares will be sold on the day such Tax Withholding Obligation arises (, a vesting date) or as soon thereafter as practicable. Participant will be responsible for all broker's fees and other costs of sale, and Participant agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale. To the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed the Tax Withholding Obligation, the Company agrees to pay such excess in cash to Participant. Participant acknowledges that the Company or its designee is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price, and that the proceeds of any such sale may not be sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, Participant agrees to pay to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the sale of shares described above.
By Sale of Shares
e.g.
(iii) . At any time not less than five (5) business days (or such fewer number of days as determined by the Committee or its designee) before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises (, a vesting date), Participant may elect to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by delivering to the Company an amount that the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by (x) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (y) delivery of a certified check payable to the Company, or (z) such other means as specified from time to time by the Committee or its designee.
By Check, Wire Transfer or Other Means
e.g.
 
7. . This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. Nothing contained in the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be interpreted as imposing any liability on the Company or the Committee in favor of Participant or any purchaser or other transferee of Units or shares of Stock with respect to any loss, cost or expense which such Participant, purchaser or other transferee may incur in connection with, or arising out of any transaction involving, any Units or shares of Stock subject to the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement.
Successors
8. . None of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement are intended to provide for an elective deferral of compensation that would be subject to Section 409A ("Section 409A") of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Company reserves the right, to the extent the Company deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, to unilaterally amend or modify the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and/or this Agreement to ensure that no awards (including, without limitation, the Units) become subject to the requirements of Section 409A, provided, however, that the Company makes no representation that the Units are not subject to Section 409A nor makes any undertaking to preclude Section 409A from applying to the Units.
No Compensation Deferrals
9. . The terms of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement are intended by the Company and Participant to be the final expression of their agreement with respect to Units and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous agreement. The Company and Participant further intend that the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall constitute the complete and exclusive statement of their terms and that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may be introduced in any arbitration, judicial, administrative or other legal proceeding involving the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement. Accordingly, the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement contain the entire understanding between the parties and supersede all prior oral, written and implied agreements, understandings, commitments and practices among the parties.
Integration
10. . Any failure to enforce any terms or conditions of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement by the Company or by Participant shall not be deemed a waiver of that term or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power for all or any other times.
Waivers
11. . If any provision of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision thereof; and the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if none of them included such provision.
Severability of Provisions
12. . All decisions of the Committee arising under the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be conclusive.
Committee Decisions Conclusive
13. . To the extent permitted by law, any dispute arising out of or relating to the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement, including the meaning or interpretation thereof, shall be resolved solely by arbitration before an arbitrator selected in accordance with the Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures of the American Arbitration Association. The location for the arbitration shall be in the county or comparable jurisdiction of Participant's employment. Judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each party shall pay an equal share of the arbitrator's fees, unless applicable law requires the Company to pay all or a greater share of the fees and costs. All statutes of limitation which would otherwise be applicable shall apply to any arbitration proceeding under this paragraph. Neither Participant nor the Company will have the right
Mandatory Arbitration
 
to participate in a class, representative or collective action, as a class representative, class member or an opt-in party, act as a private attorney general, or join or consolidate claims with claims of any other person or entity, with respect to any dispute arising out of or relating to the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement. The provisions of this paragraph are intended by Participant and the Company to be exclusive for all purposes and applicable to any and all disputes arising out of or relating to the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement. The arbitrator who hears and decides any dispute shall have jurisdiction and authority only to award compensatory damages to make whole a person or entity sustaining foreseeable economic damages, and shall not have jurisdiction and authority to make any other award of any type, including, without limitation, punitive damages, unforeseeable economic damage, damages for pain, suffering or emotional distress, or any other kind or form of damages, unless such other award is available as a matter of law. The remedy, if any, awarded by the arbitrator shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any dispute which is subject to arbitration under this paragraph.
14. . The 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced according to the laws of the State of Delaware to the extent not preempted by the federal laws of the United States of America.
Delaware Law

On December 13, 2006, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") approved the engagement of Perry-Smith LLP as the independent auditor of the Franklin Templeton Profit Sharing 401(k) Plan (the "Plan"). Accordingly, as of the same date, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") ceased to be the independent auditor of the Plan.
 
The reports of PwC on the financial statements of the Plan for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.
 
During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, and through December 13, 2006, there were no disagreements with PwC on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of PwC, would have caused PwC to make reference thereto in its reports on the Plan's financial statements for such years.
 
During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, and through December 13, 2006, there were no "reportable events" with respect to the Plan as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
 
During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, and through December 13, 2006, neither the Company nor persons on behalf of the Company or the Plan consulted with Perry-Smith LLP with respect to the Plan regarding any of the matters or events set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.
 
A copy of the foregoing disclosures was provided to PwC prior to the date of the filing of this report and PwC was requested to furnish a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not it agrees with such statements. A copy of the letter PwC furnished in response to that request is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this report.
 
 
(a) On December 13, 2006, the Board approved the amendment and restatement of the Company's Amended and Restated By-Laws (the "By-Laws"), effective as of the same date. The amendment and restatement, among other things, makes express the Company's ability to issue shares of the Company's securities in uncertificated form. By doing so, the Company has clarified its ability to meet the Direct Registration System ("DRS") requirements of the New York Stock Exchange. DRS allows shares of the Company' stock to be owned, reported and transferred electronically in uncertificated form and without the need for physical stock certificates.
 
The amendment and restatement of the By-Laws also makes express the authority to take certain corporate actions through electronic transmissions, as permitted under Delaware corporate law, rather than in paper form. Accordingly, for example, such actions may include, but are not limited to, the Board or any committee thereof acting by unanimous consent pursuant to electronic transmissions, such as through electronic mail, or giving notice to stockholders with respect to an annual or special meeting of stockholders by electronic transmission.
 
Previously, the Company's By-Laws were silent with respect to the Company's ability to issue shares in uncertificated form and the Company's ability to take corporate actions through electronic transmission.

Finally, the amendment and restatement of the By-Laws implements certain further technical and/or clarifying changes or additions to the By-Laws, such as with respect to the transfer of stock on the books of the Company and in cases where share certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
 
The summary above is qualified in its entirety by the By-Laws filed herewith as Exhibit 3.1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.

(As Adopted December 13, 2006)

Section 2.1       
Annual Meeting and Election of Directors; The Annual Meeting of Stockholders
. The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held at such place either within or without the State of Delaware and at such time and on such date as may be designated by resolution of the Board of Directors from time to time.

Section 2.2       
Special Meetings
. Special meetings of stockholders for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Board of Directors or the Chairman of the Board of Directors.

Section 2.3       
Place of Meetings
. Each annual or special meeting of stockholders shall be held at such location either within or without the State of Delaware as may be determined by the Board of Directors, or if no such determination is made, at such place as may be determined by the Chairman of the Board of Directors. If no location is so determined, any annual or special meeting shall be held at the principal executive office of the Corporation.
Section 2.4       
Notice of Meetings
. Notice of each annual or special meeting of stockholders shall contain such information, and shall be given to such persons at such time, and in such manner, including without limitation whether by electronic transmission or otherwise, as the Board of Directors shall determine, or if no such determination is made, as the Chairman of the Board shall determine, subject to the requirements of applicable law.
Section 2.5       
Adjournments
. Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned
 
 
 
meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
Section 2.6
          
Conduct of Meetings
. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, all annual and special meetings of stockholders shall be conducted in accordance with such rules and procedures as the Board of Directors may determine and, as to matters not governed by such rules and procedures, as the Chairman of such meeting shall determine.
Section 2.7
          
Quorum
. The holders of a majority of the shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at a meeting of the stockholders shall constitute a quorum thereat for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by statute, by the Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate") or by these By-Laws. If a quorum is not present or represented at a meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders so present and entitled to vote may, by majority vote, adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in Section 2.5 of these By-Laws until a quorum is present or represented. At any rescheduled meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.
Section 2.8
          
Action Without Meeting
. Any action required by statute to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders, or any action that may be taken at a meeting of the stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior written notice and without a vote if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of the outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize to take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered (by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested) to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. The signed consent or a signed copy shall be placed in the minute book of the Corporation and prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing.
Section 2.9
          
Meetings by Remote Communication
. If authorized by the Board in its sole discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board may adopt, stockholders not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may participate in a meeting of stockholders by means of remote communication and be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders, whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication.
Section 2.10
       
Voting; Proxies
. Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by him which has voting power upon the matter in question. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy pursuant to the previous sentence, a writing signed by the stockholder, a facsimile signed by the
 
2
 
 
stockholder or other electronic transmission from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or by delivering a proxy in accordance with applicable law bearing a later date to the Secretary of the Corporation. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot and, unless otherwise required by law, need not be conducted by inspectors of election unless so determined by the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon which are present in person or by proxy at such meeting. At all meetings of stockholders for the election of directors a plurality of the votes cast shall be sufficient to elect. All other elections and questions shall, unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate or these By-Laws, be decided by the vote of the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter.
Section 2.11
       
Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record
. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and which record date: (1) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than 60 nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting; (2) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, shall not be more than ten days from the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors; and (3) in the case of any other action, shall not be more than 60 days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed: (1) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; (2) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting when no prior action of the Board of Directors is required by law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation in accordance with applicable law, or, if prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action; and (3) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

Section 2.12
       
Certificates; Direct Registration System
. Shares of the Corporation's stock may be evidenced by certificates for shares of stock or may be issued in uncertificated form in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. The issuance of shares in uncertificated form shall not affect shares already represented by a certificate until the certificate is surrendered to the Corporation.
Section 2.13
       
Transfers of Stock; Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates
.

Indemnification Respecting Third Party Claims
. The Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted, and in the manner required, by the laws of the State of Delaware as in effect at the time of the adoption of this Article or as such laws may be amended from time to time shall indemnify any person who was or is made a party to or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (including any appeal thereof), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative in nature (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation), by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of, or to represent the interests of, the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, fiduciary, employee or agent (a "Subsidiary Officer") of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise (an "Affiliated Entity"), against expenses, (including attorneys' fees and disbursements), costs, judgment, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement actually
 
6
 
 
and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify against any amount paid in settlement unless the Corporation has consented to such settlement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement or conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that such person had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.1, a person shall not be entitled, as a matter of right, to indemnification pursuant to this Section 4.1 against costs or expenses incurred in connection with any action, suit or proceeding commenced by such person against any person who is or was a director, officer, fiduciary, employee or agent of the Corporation or a Subsidiary Officer of any Affiliated Entity, but such indemnification may be provided by the Corporation in a specific case as permitted by Section 4.6 of this Article.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.2, a person shall not be entitled, as a matter of right, to indemnification pursuant to this Section 4.2 against costs and expenses incurred in connection with any action or suit in the right of the Corporation commenced by such person, but such indemnification may be provided by the Corporation in any specific case as permitted by Section 4.6 of this Article.
Section 4.3
          
Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification
. Any indemnification under Section 4.1 or 4.2 of this Article (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director, officer, employee or agent is proper under the circumstances
 
7
 
 
because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in, Section 4.1 or 4.2 of this Article. Such determination shall be made with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination (i) by a majority vote of the Board of Directors who were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum or (ii) by a committee of such directors (each of whom is not a party to such action, suit or proceeding) designated by majority vote of the Board of Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors or if the disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iv) by the stockholders. In the event a request for indemnification is made by any person referred to in Section 4.1 or Section 4.2 of this Article, the Corporation shall cause such determination to be made not later than 60 days after such request is made.
Section 4.4
          
Right to Indemnification Upon Successful Defense and For Service as Witness

To the extent any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation has served or prepared to serve as a witness in any action, suit or proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative in nature) or in any investigation by the Corporation or the Board of Directors thereof or committee thereof or by any securities exchange on which securities of the Corporation are or were listed by reason of his services as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or as a Subsidiary Officer of any Affiliated Entity (other than in a suit commenced by such person), the Corporation shall indemnify such person against expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements) and costs actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith within 30 days after receipt by the Corporation from such person of a statement requesting such indemnification, averring such service and reasonably evidencing such expenses and costs.
Section 4.5
          
Advance of Expenses
. Expenses (including attorneys' fees) and costs incurred by an officer or director of the Corporation in defending a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized by this Article. Such expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by other former directors and officers, employees or agents of the Corporation may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the corporation deems appropriate.
Section 4.6
          
Indemnification Not Exclusive
. The provision of indemnification to, or the advancement of expenses and costs to, any person under this Article, or the entitlement of any person to indemnification or advancement of expenses and costs under this Article, shall not limit or restrict in any way the power of the Corporation to indemnify or advance expenses and
 
8
 
 
costs to such person in any other way permitted by law or be deemed exclusive of, or invalidate, any right to which any person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses and costs may be entitled under any law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person's capacity as an officer, director, employee or agent of the Corporation and as to action to any other capacity while holding any such position.
Section 4.7
          
Accrual of Claims; Successors
. The indemnification provided or permitted under this Article shall apply in respect of any expense, cost, judgment, fine, penalty or amount paid in settlement, whether or not the claim or cause of action in respect thereof accrued or arose before or after the effective date of this Article. The right of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation to indemnification under this Article shall continue after he shall have ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, distributes, executors, administrators and other legal representatives of such person.

Insurance
. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of, or to represent the interests of, the Corporation as a Subsidiary Officer of any Affiliated Entity, against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article or applicable law.
(a)
            
For purposes of this Article, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its corporate existence had continued, would have been permitted under applicable law to indemnify its directors, officers, employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request, or to represent the interests of, such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of any Affiliated Entity shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.

(b) On December 20, 2006, Anne M. Tatlock, a Vice Chairman, Member  Office of the Chairman of Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") determined that she will retire from her employment with the Company effective January 25, 2007. Ms. Tatlock has previously announced that she will retire as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International, a subsidiary of the Company ("Fiduciary Trust") effective January 1, 2007. Ms. Tatlock will continue as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company and of Fiduciary Trust.
 
(e) On December 20, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, pursuant to its authority under the Franklin Resources, Inc. 2004 Key Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the "KEIP"), established a maximum individual target award of $7,000,000 for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2007 (the "2007 fiscal year") for Mr. Gregory E. Johnson, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. This maximum individual target award can be achieved based on two components, operating profit margin (rounded to the nearest whole percent) and the average (rounded to the nearest whole percent) of the percentage growth of diluted earnings per share and pre-tax operating income. If the Company's operating profit margin is 35% or greater for the 2007 fiscal year, then Mr. Johnson will be entitled to receive $2,100,000 of the aggregate maximum individual target award. If such operating profit margin is 32% to 34%, then Mr. Johnson will be entitled to receive $1,890,000 or, if such operating profit margin is 28% to 31%, then Mr. Johnson will be entitled to receive $1,680,000. If such operating profit margin is less than 28%, then Mr. Johnson will forfeit any right to receive this $2,100,000 portion of the target award. If the average of the percentage growth of diluted earnings per share and pre-tax operating income for the 2007 fiscal year is 23% or greater, then Mr. Johnson will be entitled to receive $4,900,000 of the target award. If such percentage is 15% to 22%, then he will be entitled to receive $3,920,000; if such percentage is 10% to 14%, then he will be entitled to receive $2,450,000; or if such percentage is 5% to 9%, then he will be entitled to receive $980,000. If such percentage is less than 5%, then Mr. Johnson will forfeit any right to receive this $4,900,000 portion of the target award. Pre-tax operating income is defined as total operating revenue less total operating expenses determined on a consolidated basis reported as operating income included in the Company's earnings release issued after the fourth quarter of the 2007 fiscal year. Notwithstanding the potential amounts receivable pursuant to the target award, the actual award amounts payable to Mr. Johnson are subject to the Compensation Committee's authority under the KEIP to reduce the award amounts otherwise payable to him. Additionally, in accordance with the KEIP, the award amounts are payable in cash or common stock at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.
 
 
On December 13, 2006, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company approved the amendment and, in certain cases, restatement of certain of the Company's employee benefit plans, in particular the Franklin Resources, Inc. 1998 Employee Stock Investment Plan, as amended (the "ESIP"), the Franklin Resources, Inc. Amended and Restated Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (the "AIP") and the KEIP. The amendment and, in certain cases, restatement of the plans had previously been approved by the Compensation Committee of the Company and recommended to the Board for approval.
 
With respect to the ESIP, the Board approved the amendment and restatement of the ESIP to, among other things, (i) increase the maximum number of shares which shall be made available for sale or as a matching grant under the ESIP to eight million (8,000,000) shares, (ii) extend the term of the ESIP to January 31, 2018, and (iii) remove, for Purchase Periods (as such term is defined in the ESIP) occurring on and after the date the Board approved such amendment and restatement, the provision of the ESIP that
employees will not be eligible to participate in the ESIP for any relevant Purchase Period if such employee's customary employment is less than 20 hours per week. Certain clarifying, technical and/or
 
1
 
 
other minor changes to the ESIP were also approved by the Board as part of the amendment and restatement of the ESIP. The ESIP is intended to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and, accordingly, only the increase in the maximum number of shares available under the ESIP is subject to the approval of the Company's stockholders, which such approval shall be sought at the Company's next annual meeting of stockholders.
 
With respect to the AIP and the KEIP, the Board approved the amendment and restatement of the AIP and the amendment of the KEIP principally to make clarifying and technical changes to the applicable plan, including, in particular, to address the application and effects of Section 409A of the Code (relating to deferred compensation arrangements) and any related regulatory or administrative guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service. None of the amendments to the AIP or the KEIP are subject to the approval of the stockholders of the Company.
 
This brief description of the amendments and, as applicable, restatements of each of the ESIP, the AIP and the KEIP is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of each of the amended and, as applicable, restated ESIP, AIP and KEIP, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC.
1998 EMPLOYEE STOCK INVESTMENT PLAN
As Amended and Restated December 13, 2006
The following constitute the provisions of the 1998 Employee Stock Investment Plan of Franklin Resources, Inc.
The purpose of the Plan is to provide employees of the Company (as hereinafter defined) and its Designated Parents or Subsidiaries with an opportunity to purchase Common Stock of the Company through accumulated payroll deductions. It is the intention of the Company to have the Plan qualify as an "Employee Stock Investment Plan" under Section 423 of the Code (as hereinafter defined). The provisions of the Plan, accordingly, shall be construed so as to extend and limit participation in a manner consistent with the requirements of that section of the Code.
As used herein, the following definitions shall apply:
(a)           "
Accrual Period"
means a period of approximately six (6) months, commencing on February 1 and August 1 of each year and terminating on the next following July 31 or January 31, respectively, except with respect to the first accrual period which may be shorter if so determined by the Plan Administrator.
(f)         "
Compensation
" means an Employee's base salary (whether such amount is reflected by one amount or several separate components making up an aggregate amount) and commissions from the Company including paid time off and overtime or one or more Designated Parents or Subsidiaries, including such amounts of base salary and commissions as are deferred by the Employee (i) under a qualified cash or deferred arrangement described in Section 401(k) of the Code, or (ii) to a plan qualified under Section 125 of the Code. Compensation does
not
include bonuses, restricted stock awards, other annual awards, other incentive payments, reimbursements or other expense
 
 
 
allowances, fringe benefits (cash or noncash), moving expenses, deferred compensation, profit sharing or other employer matching contributions (other than employee deferral contributions described in the first sentence) made on the Employee's behalf by the Company or one (1) or more Designated Parents or Subsidiaries under any employee benefit or welfare plan now or hereafter established, and any other payments not specifically referenced in the first sentence.

(j)
             
"
Employee
" means any individual, including an officer or director, who is an employee of the Company or a Designated Parent or Subsidiary for purposes of Section 423 of the Code.

Where the period of leave exceeds ninety (90) days and the individual's right to reemployment is not guaranteed either by statute or by contract, the employment relationship will be deemed to have terminated on the ninety-first (91st) day of such leave for purposes of determining eligibility to participate in the Plan.

(b)
           
Any provisions of the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, no Employee shall be granted an option under the Plan (i) if, immediately after the grant, such Employee (taking into account stock owned by any other person which would be attributed to such Employee pursuant to Section 424(d) of the Code) would own stock and/or hold outstanding options to purchase stock possessing five percent (5%) or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or of
 
3
 
 
any Parent or Subsidiary, or (ii) which permits such person's rights to purchase stock under all employee stock purchase plans of the Company and its Parents or Subsidiaries to accrue at a rate which exceeds Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) worth of stock (determined at the Fair Market Value of the shares at the time such option is granted prior to any discounts provided for in such plan) for each calendar year in which such option is outstanding at any time. The determination of the accrual of the right to purchase stock shall be made in accordance with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and the regulations thereunder.
(c)
            
Notwithstanding subsection (a) above, Employees who are subject to rules or laws of a foreign jurisdiction that prohibit or make impractical the participation of such Employees in the Plan shall not be eligible to participate in the Plan for any relevant Purchase Period.
(a)
            
The Plan shall be implemented through overlapping or consecutive Purchase Periods until such time as (i) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan shall have been purchased or (ii) the Plan shall have been sooner terminated in accordance with Section 19 hereof. The maximum duration of a Purchase Period shall be twenty-seven (27) months. Initially, the Plan shall be implemented through overlapping Purchase Periods of twenty-four (24) months' duration commencing each February 1 and August 1 following the first Effective Date designated by the Plan Administrator (except that the initial Purchase Period shall commence on the Effective Date and shall end on January 31, 2000). The Plan Administrator shall have the authority to change the length of any Purchase Period and the length of Accrual Periods within any such Purchase Period subsequent to the initial Purchase Period by announcement at least ten (10) days prior to the commencement of the Purchase Period and to determine whether subsequent Purchase Periods shall be consecutive or overlapping. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Company determines it is inadvisable to issue and/or purchase shares of Common Stock under the Plan as of any Exercise Date, issuances and/or purchases under the Plan shall be delayed until a date specified by the Plan Administrator.
(b)
           
A Participant will be granted a separate option for each Purchase Period in which such individual participates. The option shall be granted on the Enrollment Date and will be automatically exercised in successive installments on the Exercise Dates ending within the Purchase Period.
(c)
            
An Employee may participate in only one Purchase Period at a time. Accordingly, except as provided in subsection 4(d) below, an Employee who wishes to join a new Purchase Period must withdraw from the current Purchase Period in which such Employee is participating and must also enroll in the new Purchase Period prior to the Enrollment Date for that Purchase Period.
(d)
           
If on the first day of any Accrual Period in a Purchase Period in which a Participant is participating, the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock is less than the
 
4
 
 
Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the Enrollment Date of the Purchase Period (after taking into account any adjustment during the Purchase Period pursuant to Section 18(a)), the Purchase Period shall be terminated automatically and the Participant shall be enrolled automatically in the new Purchase Period which has its first Accrual Period commencing on that date, provided the Participant is eligible to participate in the Plan on that date and has not elected to terminate participation in the Plan.
(e)
            
Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the acquisition of Common Stock through participation in the Plan for any Purchase Period shall neither limit nor require the acquisition of Common Stock by a Participant in any subsequent Purchase Period.
(a)
            
An eligible Employee may become a Participant in the Plan by completing a subscription agreement, substantially in the form of Exhibit "A" to this Plan, whether in hard copy or in electronic form, authorizing payroll deductions and submitting it with the designated payroll office of the Company at least fifteen (15) days prior to the Enrollment Date for the Purchase Period in which such participation will commence, unless a later time for submitting the subscription agreement is set by the Plan Administrator for all eligible Employees with respect to a given Purchase Period.
(b)
           
Payroll deductions for a Participant shall commence with the first payroll period following the Enrollment Date and shall end on the last complete payroll period during the Purchase Period, unless sooner terminated by the Participant as provided in Section 10.
(a)
            
At the time a Participant files a subscription agreement, such Participant shall elect to have payroll deductions made during the Purchase Period in amounts between one percent (1%) and not exceeding ten percent (10%) of the Compensation which such Participant receives during the Purchase Period.
(b)
           
All payroll deductions made for a Participant shall be credited to such Participant's account under the Plan and will be withheld in whole percentages only. A Participant may not make any additional payments into such account, except as may be required to comply with the laws of certain non-U.S. jurisdictions where payroll deductions may be prohibited by law.
(c)
            
A Participant may discontinue participation in the Plan as provided in Section 10, or may decrease the rate of payroll deductions during the Purchase Period by completing and filing with the Company a new subscription agreement authorizing a decrease in the payroll deduction rate. The decrease in rate shall be effective with the first full payroll period commencing fifteen (15) days after the Company's receipt of the new subscription agreement unless the Company elects to process a given change in participation more quickly. A Participant may increase the rate of payroll deductions for a future Purchase Period by filing with the Company a new subscription agreement
 
5
 
 
authorizing an increase in the payroll deduction rate within fifteen (15) days (unless the Company elects to process a given change in participation more quickly) before the commencement of the upcoming Purchase Period. A Participant's subscription agreement shall remain in effect for successive Purchase Periods unless terminated as provided in Section 10. The Plan Administrator shall be authorized to limit the number of payroll deduction rate changes during any Purchase Period.
(d)
           
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent necessary to comply with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and Section 3(b) herein, a Participant's payroll deductions may be decreased to 0% at such time during any Accrual Period which is scheduled to end during the current calendar year (the "Current Accrual Period") that the aggregate of all payroll deductions which were previously used to purchase stock under the Plan in a prior Accrual Period which ended during that calendar year plus all payroll deductions accumulated with respect to the Current Accrual Period equal $22,500. Payroll deductions shall recommence at the rate provided in such Participant's subscription agreement at the beginning of the first Accrual Period which is scheduled to end in the following calendar year, unless terminated by the Participant as provided in Section 10.
(a)
            
On the Enrollment Date, each Participant in such Purchase Period shall be granted an option to purchase on each Exercise Date of such Purchase Period (at the applicable Purchase Price) up to a number of shares of the Common Stock determined by dividing such Participant's payroll deductions accumulated prior to such Exercise Date by the applicable Purchase Price; provided (i) that such purchase shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 3(b) and 12 hereof, and (ii) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock a Participant will be permitted to purchase in any Accrual Period will be two thousand (2,000) shares, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 18 hereof. Exercise of the option shall occur as provided in Section 8, unless the Participant has withdrawn pursuant to Section 10, and the option, to the extent not exercised, shall expire on the last day of the Purchase Period.
(b)
           
The Company may, in its sole discretion, provide matching grants in a uniform and non-discriminatory manner (in whole or partial shares) of Common Stock to Participants who satisfy specified ongoing holding period requirements with respect to shares purchased hereunder upon such terms and conditions as are determined from time to time by the Plan Administrator.
Unless a Participant withdraws from the Plan as provided in Section 10 below, such Participant's option for the purchase of shares will be exercised automatically on each Exercise Date, and the maximum number of shares (including fractional shares) subject to the option shall be purchased for such Participant at the applicable Purchase Price with the accumulated payroll deductions in such Participant's account. The Plan Administrator shall be authorized to establish procedures for the handling of fractional shares, including the distribution of cash in lieu thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
 
6
 
 
any amount remaining in the Participant's account following the purchase of shares on the Exercise Date due to the application of Section 423 (b) (8) of the Code, shall be returned to the Participant. During a Participant's lifetime, a Participant's option to purchase shares hereunder is exercisable only by such Participant.
Upon receipt of a request from a Participant after each Exercise Date on which a purchase of shares occurs, the Company shall arrange the delivery to such Participant, as promptly as practicable, of a certificate representing the shares purchased upon exercise of such Participant's option. The shares purchased under the Plan may also be delivered in uncertificated form by way of an electronic transfer to the brokerage account of participant.
(a)
            
A Participant may withdraw all, but not less than all of the payroll deductions credited to such Participant's account and not yet used to exercise such Participant's option under the Plan at any time by giving at least fifteen (15) days prior written notice to the Company, substantially in the form of Exhibit "B" to this Plan, whether in hard copy or electronic form. All of the Participant's payroll deductions credited to such Participant's account will be paid to such Participant as promptly as practicable after receipt of notice of withdrawal, such Participant's option for the Purchase Period will be automatically terminated, and no further payroll deductions will be made during the Purchase Period. If a Participant withdraws from a Purchase Period, payroll deductions will not resume at the beginning of the succeeding Purchase Period unless the Participant delivers a new subscription agreement to the Company.
(b)
           
Upon a Participant's ceasing to be an Employee for any reason or upon termination of a Participant's employment relationship (as described in Section 2(j)), the payroll deductions credited to such Participant's account during the Purchase Period, but not yet used to purchase shares will be returned to such Participant or, in the case of such Participant's death, to the person or persons entitled thereto under Section 14, and such Participant's option will be automatically terminated.
No interest shall accrue on the payroll deductions credited to a Participant's account under the Plan under any circumstances or at any time.
(a)
            
The maximum number of shares of Common Stock which shall be made available for sale or as a matching grant under the Plan shall be eight million (8,000,000) shares, subject to adjustment upon changes in capitalization of the Company as provided for in Section 18. If on a given Exercise Date, the number of shares with respect to which options are to be exercised exceeds the number of shares then available under the Plan, the Plan Administrator shall make a pro rata allocation of the shares remaining
 
7
 
 
available for purchase among the Participants in as uniform a manner as shall be practicable and as it shall determine to be equitable.
(b)
           
A Participant will have no interest or voting right in shares covered by such Participant's option until such shares are actually purchased on such Participant's behalf in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Plan. No adjustment shall be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date of such purchase.
(c)
            
Shares to be delivered to a Participant under the Plan will be registered in the name of the Participant or in the name of the Participant and such Participant's spouse.
The Plan shall be administered by the Board or a committee of members of the Board appointed by the Board. The Board or its committee shall have full and exclusive discretionary authority to construe, interpret and apply the terms of the Plan, to determine eligibility and to adjudicate all disputed claims filed under the Plan. Every finding, decision and determination made by the Board or its committee shall, to the full extent permitted by law, be final and binding upon all persons.
(a)
            
Each Participant will file a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any shares and cash, if any, from the Participant's account under the Plan in the event of such Participant's death. If a Participant is married and the designated beneficiary is not the spouse, spousal consent shall be required for such designation to be effective.
(b)
           
Such designation of beneficiary may be changed by the Participant (and such Participant's spouse, if any) at any time by written notice. In the event of the death of a Participant and in the absence of a beneficiary validly designated under the Plan who is living at the time of such Participant's death, the Company shall deliver such shares and/or cash to the executor or administrator of the estate of the Participant, or if no such executor or administrator has been appointed (to the knowledge of the Plan Administrator), the Plan Administrator, in its discretion, may deliver such shares and/or cash to the spouse or to any one or more dependents or relatives of the Participant, or if no spouse, dependent or relative is known to the Plan Administrator, then to such other person as the Plan Administrator may designate.
Neither payroll deductions credited to a Participant's account nor any rights with regard to the exercise of an option or to receive shares under the Plan may be assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of in any way (other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution or as provided in Section 14 hereof) by the Participant, nor shall it be subject to attachment or other legal process of whatever nature. Provided, however,
 
8
 
 
that the shares purchased under the Plan may also be delivered in uncertificated form by way of an electronic transfer to the brokerage account of participant. Any such attempt at assignment, attachment, transfer, pledge or other disposition shall be without effect, except that the Plan Administrator may treat such act as an election to withdraw funds from a Purchase Period in accordance with Section 10.
All payroll deductions received along with any other funds held by the Company under the Plan may be used by the Company for any corporate purpose, and the Company shall not be obligated to segregate such payroll deductions or funds.
Individual accounts will be maintained for each Participant in the Plan. Statements of account will be given to Participants at least annually, which statements will set forth the amounts of payroll deductions, the Purchase Price, the number of shares purchased and the remaining cash balance, if any.
(a)
            
Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company, the Reserves, as well as the Purchase Price, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Common Stock, or any other similar event resulting in an increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock. Such adjustment shall be made by the Plan Administrator, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided for herein, no issue by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of Common Stock subject to an option. The Plan Administrator may, if it so determines in the exercise of its sole discretion, make provision for adjusting the Reserves, as well as the price per share of Common Stock covered by each outstanding option, in the event the Company effects one or more reorganizations, recapitalizations, rights offerings or other increases or reductions of shares of its outstanding Common Stock.
(b)
           
Corporate Transactions
. In the event of a proposed Corporate Transaction, each option under the Plan shall be assumed by such successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation, unless the Plan Administrator, in the exercise of its sole discretion and in lieu of such assumption, determines to shorten the Purchase Period then in progress by setting a new Exercise Date (the "New Exercise Date"). If the Plan Administrator shortens the Purchase Period then in progress in lieu of assumption in the event of a Corporate Transaction, the Plan Administrator shall notify each Participant in writing, at least ten (10) business days prior to the New Exercise Date, that the Exercise Date for the Participant's option has been changed to the New Exercise Date and that
either
:
 
9
 
 
 
(1)
           
the Participant's option will be exercised automatically on the New Exercise Date, unless prior to such date the Participant has withdrawn from the Purchase Period as provided in Section 10; or
(2)
           
the Company shall pay to the Participant on the New Exercise Date an amount in cash, cash equivalents, or property as determined by the Plan Administrator that is equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the Fair Market Value of the shares subject to the option over (ii) the Purchase Price due had the Participant's option been exercised automatically under Subsection (b)(1) above. In addition, all remaining accumulated payroll deduction amounts shall be returned to the Participant.
(c)
            
For purposes of this Section 18, an option granted under the Plan shall be deemed to be assumed if, in connection with the Corporate Transaction, the option is replaced with a comparable option with respect to shares of capital stock of the successor corporation or Parent thereof. The determination of option comparability shall be made by the Plan Administrator prior to the Corporate Transaction and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons.
(a)
            
The Plan Administrator may at any time and for any reason terminate or amend the Plan. Except as provided in Section 18 or this Section 19, no such termination can affect options previously granted, provided that a Purchase Period may be terminated by the Plan Administrator on any Exercise Date if the Plan Administrator determines that the termination of the Purchase Period is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Except as provided in Section 18 or this Section 19, no amendment may make any change in any option theretofore granted which adversely affects the rights of any Participant. To the extent necessary to comply with Section 423 of the Code (or any successor rule or provision or any other applicable law or regulation), the Company shall obtain stockholder approval in such a manner and to such a degree as required.
(b)
           
Without stockholder consent and without regard to whether any Participant rights may be considered to have been "adversely affected," the Plan Administrator shall be entitled to change the Purchase Periods, limit the frequency and/or number of changes in the amount withheld during Purchase Periods, establish the exchange ratio applicable to amounts withheld in a currency other than U.S. dollars, establish additional terms, conditions, rules or procedures to accommodate the rules or laws of applicable foreign jurisdictions, permit payroll withholding in excess of the amount designated by a Participant in order to adjust for delays or mistakes in the Company's processing of properly completed withholding elections, establish reasonable waiting and adjustment periods and/or accounting and crediting procedures to ensure that amounts applied toward the purchase of Common Stock for each Participant properly correspond with amounts withheld from the Participant's Compensation, and establish such other limitations or procedures as the Plan Administrator determines in its sole discretion advisable and which are consistent with the Plan.

On December 13, 2006, the Board approved an amendment and restatement of the Plan to (i) increase the maximum number of shares which shall be made available for sale or as a matching grant under the Plan to eight million (8,000,000) shares, (ii) extend the term of the Plan to January 31, 2018, and (iii) remove, for Purchase Periods occurring on and after the date the Board approved such amendment and restatement, the provision that
Employees will not be eligible to participate in the Plan for any relevant Purchase Period if such Employee's customary employment is less than 20 hours per week. The increase in the maximum number of shares available requires the approval of the Company's stockholders.
All notices or other communications by a Participant to the Company under or in connection with the Plan shall be deemed to have been duly given when received in the form specified by the Plan Administrator at the location, or by the person, designated by the Plan Administrator for the receipt thereof.
Shares shall not be issued with respect to an option unless the exercise of such option and the issuance and delivery of such shares pursuant thereto shall comply with all applicable provisions of law, domestic or foreign, including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the shares may then be listed, and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance. As a condition to the exercise of an option, the Company may require the Participant to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required by any of the aforementioned applicable provisions of law. In addition, no options shall be exercised or shares issued hereunder before the Plan shall have been approved by stockholders of the Company in accordance with Section 423 of the Code.
The Plan shall become effective upon January 1, 1998. It shall continue until January 31, 2018 unless sooner terminated under Section 19. The first Effective Date under the Plan shall be determined as set forth in Section 2(i).
The Plan does not, directly or indirectly, create any right for the benefit of any employee or class of employees to purchase any shares under the Plan, or create in any employee or class of employees any right with respect to continuation of employment by the Company or a Designated Parent or Subsidiary, and it shall not be deemed to interfere in any way with such employer's right to terminate, or otherwise modify, an employee's employment at any time.
 
11
 
 
 
The provisions of the Plan shall, in accordance with its terms, be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, all successors of each Participant, including, without limitation, such Participant's estate and the executors, administrators or trustees thereof, heirs and legatees, and any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy or representative of creditors of such Participant.
The laws of the State of Delaware (excluding that body of law pertaining to its conflicts of law) will govern all matters relating to this Plan except to the extent it is superseded by the laws of the United States.

IV. AWARD POOL FUNDING AND INDIVIDUAL AWARDS
 
4.1 For each Plan Year, the Committee shall:
 
(a) Determine the percentage, not to exceed Twenty Percent (20%), if any, of PTOI that will be allocated to the Award Pool at various levels of Company performance measured by changes in PTOI from the prior year. The Committee may also determine if in its opinion prevailing circumstance dictates that the Award Pool for particular identified groups of Principals and/or Associates shall be based upon the PTOI of particular identified subsidiary or subsidiaries of the Company. The determinations made by the Committee may be subject to review and approval by the Board of Directors of Franklin Resources, Inc. if the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, deems such review and approval to be appropriate.

4.4 Actual Incentive Awards may be determined during or following the end of each Plan Year.

4.5 The Principals' Pool, if any, will be allocated among any or all Principals on the basis of a Participant's individual performance and based upon the accomplishment of such Participant's goals and objectives for the Plan Year. No Principals are guaranteed a payout from the Principals' Pool.
 
4.6 The Associates' Pool will be allocated among any or all Associates on the basis of a Participant's individual performance and based upon the accomplishment of such Participant's goals and objectives for the Plan Year. No Associates are guaranteed a payout from the Associates' Pool.
 
4.7 To promote the highest levels of individual performance, there is no minimum or maximum which applies to individual Incentive Awards of any Participant. Amounts not allocated as Incentive Awards do not carry over to the next Plan Year, and may be used for distribution as incentive compensation to employees who are not Participants in the Plan.

5.2 Application of Code Section 409A.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, the Company, in its sole discretion and without Participant consent, may amend or modify the Plan in any manner to provide for the application and effects of Section 409A of the Code (relating to deferred compensation arrangements) and any related regulatory or administrative guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company shall have the authority to delay the payment of any benefits described under the Plan to the extent it deems necessary or appropriate to comply with Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code (relating to payments made to certain "key employees" of certain publicly-traded companies) and in such event, any such payments to which a Participant would otherwise be entitled during the six (6) month period immediately following his or her separation from service will be paid on the first business day following the expiration of such six (6) month period.

VIII. AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION
 
8.1 Amendment.
 
The Committee reserves the right in its discretion to amend this Plan or any Incentive Award(s) at any time in whole or in part, provided, however, that no amendment shall result in the forfeiture or cancellation of any Participant's Incentive Award(s) earned as of the end of the fiscal year immediately preceding the date the Committee adopts the amendment, unless otherwise agreed to by the affected Participant(s).
 
8.2 Termination.
 
The Committee may terminate the Plan at any time. Termination shall not result in the forfeiture or cancellation of any Participant's Incentive Award(s) which have been determined but not yet paid, unless otherwise agreed to by the affected Participant(s).
 
IX. ADMINISTRATION
 
9.1 Administration of the Plan.
 
This Plan has been adopted by the stockholders of Franklin Resources, Inc. and shall be administered by the Committee.
 
(a) The Committee shall meet at such times and places and upon such notice as the chairperson determines in consultation with the other Committee members. A majority of the Committee shall constitute a quorum. Any acts by the Committee may be taken at any meeting at which a quorum is present and shall be by majority vote of those members entitled to vote. Additionally, any acts reduced to writing or approved in writing by all the members of the Committee shall be valid acts of the Committee.
 
(b) Among the administrative responsibilities of the Committee shall be the determination of Principals, if any, and Associates, Target Awards, if applicable, and Incentive Awards. This may be accomplished by adopting specific methods of determining the Target Awards and/or Incentive Awards which are then administered by management personnel of the Company.
 
(c) The Committee shall have the sole authority, in its absolute discretion, to adopt, amend, and rescind such rules and regulations as, in its opinion, may be advisable in the administration of the Plan, to construe and interpret the Plan, the rules and regulations, and any instruments evidencing Incentive Awards and to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan. All decisions, determinations, and interpretations of the Committee shall be binding on all Participants.
 
6
 
 
 
(d) The Plan is intended to meet the requirements of the rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and shall be administered and construed accordingly.
 
9.2 Non-alienation of Benefits.
 
No benefit under this Plan may be sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed, hypothecated, encumbered, anticipated, or otherwise disposed of, and any attempt to do so shall be void. No such benefit shall, prior to receipt thereof by a Participant, be in any manner subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements, or torts of such Participant.
 
9.3 No Limitation of Rights.
 
Nothing in this Plan shall be construed to limit in any way the Company's general personnel policies and procedures particularly with respect to the right of the Company to terminate a Participant's employment at any time for any reason whatsoever with or without cause; nor shall it be evidence of any agreement or understanding, express or implied, that the Company (a) will employ a Participant in any particular position, (b) will ensure participation in any incentive programs, or (c) will grant any awards for such programs.
 
9.4 Applicable Law.
 
The provisions of the Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, with the exception of Delaware's conflict of laws provisions.
 
9.5 Mandatory Arbitration.
 
As part of this Plan, the Company is implementing an alternative dispute resolution procedure for its employees. In the event there is any dispute arising out of unlawful harassment, discrimination or termination of employment with the Company, which the parties are unable to resolve through direct discussion or mediation, regardless of the kind or type of dispute, the Participant and the Company agree to submit all such disputes exclusively to final and binding arbitration pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, or, if inapplicable, the provisions of applicable state law, or any successor or replacement statutes, upon a request submitted in writing to the Human Resources Department within the applicable statutory limits or the statute of limitations. Any failure to timely request arbitration shall constitute a waiver of all rights to raise any claims in any forum arising out of any dispute that was subject to arbitration. The limitations period set forth in this paragraph shall not be subject to tolling, equitable or otherwise. Any agreement to arbitrate disputes contained in a securities registration application shall take precedence over this Section 9.5. All substantive rights guaranteed under the statutes are still recognized through arbitration, and arbitration is merely a substituted forum for dispute resolutions.

If a Participant terminates employment with the Company for any reason after the end of the applicable Plan Year but prior to the date the Actual Award for such Plan Year is paid, the Participant shall be entitled to the payment of the Actual Award for the Plan Year subject to reduction or elimination under Section 3.6 based on the circumstances surrounding such termination of employment.

SECTION 4
PAYMENT OF AWARDS
 
4.1
Right to Receive Payment
. Each Actual Award that may become payable under the Plan shall be paid solely from the general assets of the Company. Nothing in this Plan shall be construed to create a trust or to establish or evidence any Participant's claim of any right other than as an unsecured general creditor with respect to any payment to which he or she may be entitled.
 
4.2
Timing of Payment
. Payment of each Actual Award shall be made within the period ending on the later to occur of the date that is two and a half (2
 1
/
2
) calendar months from the end of (i) a Participant's tax year that includes the applicable date during which the Award was earned, or (ii) the Plan Year that includes the applicable date during which the Award was earned.
 
4.3
Form of Payment
. Each Actual Award normally shall be paid in cash (or its equivalent) in a single lump sum. However, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may declare any Actual Award, in whole or in part, payable in the form of a stock bonus granted under the Franklin Resources, Inc. 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (the "2002 Plan") or successor equity compensation plan (subject to the limit on the maximum number of shares that may be issued under the 2002 Plan or successor equity compensation plan and any additional limitations on the maximum number of shares that may be awarded to any individual in any fiscal or calendar year under the 2002 Plan or successor equity compensation plan, as applicable). The number of shares granted shall be determined by dividing (i) the cash amount of all or such portion of the Actual Award to be paid as a stock bonus, by (ii) the fair market value of a share of common stock of Franklin Resources, Inc. on the date that the cash payment of the Actual Award otherwise would have been made. For this purpose, "fair market value" shall be defined as provided in the 2002 Plan or successor equity compensation plan. Any shares issued pursuant to a stock bonus granted under the 2002 Plan or successor equity compensation plan may be either fully vested or subject to vesting.
 
4.4
Other Deferral of Actual Awards.
The Committee may establish one or more programs under the Plan to permit selected Participants the opportunity to elect to defer receipt of Actual Awards. The Committee may establish the election procedures, the timing of such elections, the mechanisms for payments of, and accrual of interest or other earnings, if any, on amounts so deferred, and such other terms, conditions, rules and procedures that the Committee deems advisable for the administration of any such deferral program.
 
4.5
Payment in the Event of Death
. If a Participant dies prior to the payment of an Actual Award earned by him or her for a prior Plan Year, the Actual Award shall be paid to the Participant's Beneficiary. If a Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary or if each person designated as a Beneficiary predeceases the Participant or dies prior to payment of an Actual Award, then the Committee shall direct the payment of such Actual Award to the Participant's estate.
 
SECTION 5
ADMINISTRATION
 
5.1
Committee is the Administrator
. The Plan shall be administered by the Committee.
 
 
4
 
 
 
5.2
Committee Authority
. The Committee shall have all discretion and authority necessary or appropriate to administer the Plan and to interpret the provisions of the Plan, consistent with qualification of the Plan as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m). Any determination, decision or action of the Committee in connection with the construction, interpretation, administration or application of the Plan shall be final, conclusive, and binding upon all persons, and shall be given the maximum deference permitted by law.
 
5.3
Tax Withholding
. The Company shall withhold all applicable taxes from any payment, including any non-U.S., federal, state, and local taxes.
 
SECTION 6
GENERAL PROVISION
 
6.1
Nonassignability
. A Participant shall have no right to assign or transfer any interest under this Plan.
 
6.2
No Effect on Employment
. The establishment and subsequent operation of the Plan, including eligibility as a Participant, shall not be construed as conferring any legal or other rights upon any Participant for the continuation of his or her employment for any Plan Year or any other period. Generally, employment with the Company is on an at will basis only. Except as may be provided in an employment contract with the Participant, the Company expressly reserves the right, which may be exercised at any time and without regard to when during a Plan Year such exercise occurs, to terminate any Participant's employment without cause, and to treat him or her without regard to the effect which such treatment might have upon him or her as a Participant.
 
6.3
No Individual Liability
. No member of the Committee or the Board, or any officer of the Company, shall be liable for any determination, decision or action made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any award under the Plan.
 
6.4
Severability; Governing Law
. If any provision of the Plan is found to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall not affect the other provisions of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed in all respects as if such invalid provision has been omitted. The provisions of the Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, with the exception of California's conflict of laws provisions.
 
6.5
Affiliates of the Company
. Requirements referring to employment with the Company or payment of awards may, in the Committee's discretion, be performed through the Company or any affiliate of the Company.
 
6.6
Application of Code Section 409A
. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, the Company, in its sole discretion and without Participant consent, may amend or modify the Plan in any manner to provide for the application and effects of Section 409A of the Code (relating to deferred compensation arrangements) and any related regulatory or administrative guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company shall have the authority to delay the payment of any benefits described under the Plan to the extent it deems necessary or appropriate to comply with Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code (relating to payments made to certain "key employees" of certain publicly-traded companies) and in such event, any such payments to which a Participant would otherwise be entitled during the six (6) month period immediately following his or her separation from service will be paid on the first business day following the expiration of such six (6) month period.
 
5
 
 
 
SECTION 7
AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION
 
7.1
Amendment and Termination
. The Board may amend or terminate the Plan at any time and for any reason; provided, however, that if and to the extent required to ensure the Plan's qualification under Code Section 162(m), any such amendment shall be subject to stockholder approval.
 
Last amended as of December 13, 2006.

(a)
On July 9, 2007, the Board of Directors of Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") approved amendments to, and restated, the Company's by-laws (the "Amended and Restated By-Laws"). This amendment and restatement of the Company's by-laws became effective on July 9, 2007.
The amendments added an advance notice of stockholder business and nominations requirement (Section 2.3 of the Amended and Restated By-Laws), which generally prescribes the procedures that a stockholder of the Company must follow if the stockholder intends, at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, to nominate a person for election to the Company's Board of Directors or to propose other business to be considered by stockholders. These procedures include, among other things, that the stockholder give timely notice to the Secretary of the Company of the nomination or other proposed business, that the notice contain specified information, and that the stockholder comply with certain other requirements (all as described in Section 2.3 of the Amended and Restated By-Laws). Generally, in the case of an annual meeting of stockholders, a stockholder's notice in order to be timely must be delivered in writing to the Secretary of the Company, at its principal executive office, not later than the close of business on the 120th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 150th day prior to the first anniversary of the date on which the Company first (i) mailed its notice of annual meeting, proxy statement and proxy or (ii) sent its notice of annual meeting and notice of internet availability of its proxy materials, whichever is earlier, for the immediately preceding year's annual meeting. As specified in the Amended and Restated By-Laws, different notice deadlines apply in the case of a special meeting, or when the date of an annual meeting is more than 30 days before or after the first anniversary of the prior year's meeting. If a stockholder's nomination or proposal is not in compliance with the procedures set forth in the Amended and Restated By-Laws, the Company may disregard such nomination or proposal.
The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Amended and Restated By-Laws, which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Stockholder Proposals and Nominations of Board Members at 2008 Annual Meeting:
As a result of the amendments described above, if a stockholder of the Company intends, at the Company's upcoming 2008 annual meeting of stockholders, to nominate a person for election to the Company's Board of Directors or to propose other business, the stockholder must deliver a notice of such nomination or proposal to the Company's Secretary not later than the close of business on August 31, 2007, and not earlier than the close of business on August 1, 2007, and comply with the requirements of the Amended and Restated By-Laws. The notice should be addressed in writing to: Corporate Secretary, Franklin Resources, Inc., One Franklin Parkway, San Mateo, CA 94403-1906.
The amendments to the Company's by-laws described above do not affect the ability of a stockholder to have a proposal included in the Company's proxy statement in reliance on Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. If a stockholder intends to present a proposal in accordance with Rule 14a-8 for consideration at the Company's 2008 annual meeting of stockholders, the proposal must be received by the Secretary of the Company by August 31, 2007. Such proposal must also meet the other requirements of the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission relating to stockholder proposals.
If a stockholder submits a proposal outside of Rule 14a-8 for the Company's upcoming 2008 annual meeting of stockholders and such proposal is not delivered within the time frame specified in the Amended and Restated By-Laws, the Company's proxy may confer discretionary authority on persons being appointed as proxies on behalf of the Company to vote on such proposal.

(2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of paragraph (a)(1) of this Section 2.3, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation and any such proposed business other than the nomination
of persons for election to the Board of Directors must constitute a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 120th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 150th day prior to the first anniversary of the date on which the Corporation first (i) mailed its notice of annual meeting, proxy statement and proxy or (ii) sent its notice of annual meeting and notice of internet availability of its proxy materials, whichever is earlier, for the immediately preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 30 days after (other than as a result of adjournment) the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 150th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 120th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth: (i) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director (A) all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and (B) such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected; (ii) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the By-Laws of the Corporation, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (iii) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (A) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, (B) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, (C) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (D) a representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group which intends (I) to deliver a proxy statement and proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (II) otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such proposal or nomination. The foregoing notice requirements of this Section 2.3 shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder if the stockholder has notified the Corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal or nomination at an annual
 
meeting in compliance with applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act and such stockholder's proposal or nomination has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation.
(3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 2.3 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation specifying the number of directors to be elected or naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least 120 days day prior to the first anniversary of the date on which the Corporation first (i) mailed its notice of annual meeting, proxy statement and proxy or (ii) or sent its notice of annual meeting and notice of internet availability of its proxy materials, whichever is earlier, for the immediately preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 2.3 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.
(b) Special Meetings of Stockholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting (1) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (2) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this Section 2.3 is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and upon such election and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.3. In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 2.3 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 150th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 120th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made by the Corporation of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
 
(c) General.
(1) With respect to stockholder nominations and proposals, only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.3 shall be eligible to be elected at an annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.3.

Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy pursuant to the previous sentence, a writing signed by the stockholder, a facsimile signed by the stockholder or other electronic transmission from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or by delivering a proxy in accordance with applicable law bearing a later date to the Secretary of the Corporation. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot and, unless otherwise required by law, need not be conducted by inspectors of election unless so determined by the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon which are present in person or by proxy at such meeting. At all meetings of stockholders for the election of directors a plurality of the votes cast shall be sufficient to elect. All other elections and questions shall, unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate or these By-Laws, be decided by the vote of the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.2, a person shall not be entitled, as a matter of right, to indemnification pursuant to this Section 4.2 against costs and expenses incurred in connection with any action or suit in the right of the Corporation commenced by such person, but such indemnification may be provided by the Corporation in any specific case as permitted by Section 4.6 of this Article.

Such expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by other former directors and officers, employees or agents of the Corporation may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Corporation deems appropriate.
Advance of Expenses
 
Section 4.6 . The provision of indemnification to, or the advancement of expenses and costs to, any person under this Article, or the entitlement of any person to indemnification or advancement of expenses and costs under this Article, shall not limit or restrict in any way the power of the Corporation to indemnify or advance expenses and costs to such person in any other way permitted by law or be deemed exclusive of, or invalidate, any right to which any person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses and costs may be entitled under any law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person's capacity as an officer, director, employee or agent of the Corporation and as to action to any other capacity while holding any such position.

The Board also adopted amendments to the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines requiring the Corporate Governance Committee to establish procedures to implement a director resignation policy in situations where a director fails to receive a majority of votes cast in his or her election. The Board has discretion whether to accept or reject the resignations and will publicly disclose its decision within 90 days of certification of election results.

(2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of paragraph (a)(1) of this Section 2.3, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation and any such proposed business other than the nomination
of persons for election to the Board of Directors must constitute a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 120th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 150th day prior to the first anniversary of the date on which the Corporation first (i) mailed its notice of annual meeting, proxy statement and proxy or (ii) sent its notice of annual meeting and notice of internet availability of its proxy materials, whichever is earlier, for the immediately preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 30 days after (other than as a result of adjournment) the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 150th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 120th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth: (i) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director (A) all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and (B) such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected; (ii) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the By-Laws of the Corporation, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (iii) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (A) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, (B) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, (C) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (D) a representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group which intends (I) to deliver a proxy statement and proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (II) otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such proposal or nomination. The foregoing notice requirements of this Section 2.3 shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder if the stockholder has notified the Corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal or nomination at an annual
 
meeting in compliance with applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act and such stockholder's proposal or nomination has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation.
(3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 2.3 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation specifying the number of directors to be elected or naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least 120 days day prior to the first anniversary of the date on which the Corporation first (i) mailed its notice of annual meeting, proxy statement and proxy or (ii) or sent its notice of annual meeting and notice of internet availability of its proxy materials, whichever is earlier, for the immediately preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 2.3 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.

In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 2.3 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 150th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 120th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made by the Corporation of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.

At any rescheduled meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.
Quorum
Section 2.9 . Any action required by statute to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders, or any action that may be taken at a meeting of the stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior written notice and without a vote if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of the outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize to take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered (by hand or

Section 2.11 .
Voting; Proxies
(a) One Vote.
Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by him which has voting power upon the matter in question.

Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy pursuant to the previous sentence, a writing signed by the stockholder, a facsimile signed by the stockholder or other electronic transmission from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or by delivering a proxy in accordance with applicable law bearing a later date to the Secretary of the Corporation.
(c) Voting.

which are present in person or by proxy at such meeting. At all meetings of stockholders for the election of directors, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast; provided, that if as of the record date for such meeting the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors, not exceeding the authorized number of directors as fixed by the Board of Directors in accordance with the Certificate, shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast. For purposes of this Section 2.11(c), a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted for' a director must exceed the number of shares voted against' that director. All other elections and questions shall, unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate or these By-Laws, be decided by the vote of the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter.
Section 2.12 . In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and which record date: (1) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than 60 nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting; (2) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, shall not be more than ten days from the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors; and (3) in the case of any other action, shall not be more than 60 days prior to such other action.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.2, a person shall not be entitled, as a matter of right, to indemnification pursuant to this Section 4.2 against costs and expenses incurred in connection with any action or suit in the right of the Corporation commenced by such person, but such indemnification may be provided by the Corporation in any specific case as permitted by Section 4.6 of this Article.
Section 4.3 . Any indemnification under Section 4.1 or 4.2 of this Article (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director, officer, employee or agent is proper under the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in, Section 4.1 or 4.2 of this Article. Such determination shall be made with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination (i) by a majority vote of the Board of Directors who were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum or (ii) by a committee of such directors (each of whom is not a party to such action, suit or proceeding) designated by majority vote of the Board of Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors or if the disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iv) by the stockholders. In the event a request for indemnification is made by any person referred to in Section 4.1 or Section 4.2 of this Article, the Corporation shall cause such determination to be made not later than 60 days after such request is made.

Such expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by other former directors and officers, employees or agents of the Corporation may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Corporation deems appropriate.
Advance of Expenses
Section 4.6 .

On January 31, 2008, the stockholders of Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company"), at the 2008 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, approved an amendment and restatement of the Company's 2004 Key Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan").
The Plan was principally revised to:
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following summary describes the material features of the Plan, including the amendments, but is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Plan, attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto.
Purpose of the Plan
The Plan provides the Company's key employees with the opportunity to earn incentive awards based on the achievement of goals relating to the performance of the Company and its business units. The Plan is intended to increase stockholder value and the success of the Company by motivating key employees to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve the Company's objectives.
Administration of the Plan
The Plan is currently administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). Such committee, acting as the plan administrator, has full authority to interpret the provisions of the Plan, consistent with qualification of the Plan as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code.
Eligibility to Receive Awards
Key employees of the Company and its affiliates are eligible to participate in the Plan. Participation in the Plan by any particular key employee is determined by the Compensation Committee in its discretion. In selecting participants for the Plan, the Compensation Committee will choose employees of the Company and its affiliates who are likely to have a significant impact on Company performance.
Target Awards and Performance Goals
For each performance period, the Compensation Committee will establish in writing: (1) target awards for each participant, (2) the performance goals which must be achieved in order for the participant to be paid a target award, and (3) the payout formula for determining the actual award paid to a participant. The payout formula will be based on a comparison of actual performance to the performance goals, provide for the payment of a participant's target award if the performance goals for a relevant performance period are achieved, and provide for an actual award that is greater or less than a participant's target award depending upon the extent to which actual performance exceeds or falls below the performance goals.
Each participant's target award will be (1) expressed as a percentage of his or her base salary, (2) expressed as a percentage of an award pool established for the particular Plan year, or (3) a specified amount determined by the Compensation Committee based on target awards established by the Compensation Committee.
Base salary under the Plan means the participant's annual salary rate on the last day of the year or on the last day of the applicable fiscal year for any performance period, as determined by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee may determine in its sole discretion whether or not to establish an award pool for a particular Plan year.
The performance goals applicable to the participants may consist of one or more of the following measures: (a) annual revenue, (b) budget comparisons, (c) controllable profits, (d) Company earnings per share, (e) expense management, (f) improvements in capital structure, (g) net income, (h) net or gross sales, (i) operating income (pre- or post-tax), (j) profit margins, (k) operating or gross margin, (l) profitability of an identifiable business unit or product, (m) return on investments, (n) return on sales, (o) return on stockholders' equity, (p) total return to stockholders, (q) assets under management, (r) investment management performance, (s) mutual and other investment fund performance, (t) institutional account performance, (u) high net worth
 
and other separate account performance, (v) cash flow, operating cash flow, or cash flow or operating cash flow per share (before or after dividends), (w) price of the shares or any other publicly traded securities of the Company, (x) reduction in costs, (y) return on capital, including return on total capital or return on invested capital, (z) improvement in or attainment of expense levels or working capital levels, and (aa) performance of the Company relative to a peer group of companies and/or relevant indexes on any of the foregoing measures. The Compensation Committee may set performance goals which differ from participant to participant. For example, the Compensation Committee may choose performance goals which apply on either a corporate or business unit basis, as deemed appropriate in light of the participant's responsibilities.
Performance goals are calculated in accordance with GAAP, but excluding the effect of any change in accounting standards and any extraordinary, unusual or nonrecurring item, as determined by the Compensation Committee, occurring after the establishment of the performance goals applicable to the actual award intended to be performance-based compensation. Such adjustment will be made solely for the purpose of providing a consistent basis from period to period for the calculation of performance goals in order to prevent the dilution or enlargement of a participant's rights with respect to an actual award intended to be performance-based compensation.
Determination of Actual Awards
After the end of each performance period, the Compensation Committee must certify in writing the extent to which the performance goals applicable to each participant were achieved or exceeded. The actual award (if any) for each participant will be determined by applying the formula to the level of actual performance which has been certified by the Compensation Committee. However, the Compensation Committee retains discretion to eliminate or reduce the actual award payable to any participant below that which would otherwise be payable under the applicable formula. In addition, no participant's actual award under the Plan may exceed $15 million for any twelve months in a performance period.
The Plan contains a continuous employment requirement. If a participant terminates employment with the Company for any reason after the end of the applicable performance period but prior to the award payment date, he or she will be entitled to the payment of the award for the year, provided, however, that the Compensation Committee may reduce (or eliminate) his or her actual award based on such considerations as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate. If a participant terminates employment with the Company prior to the end of the applicable performance period for any reason other than death, disability or retirement, the Compensation Committee will proportionately reduce (or eliminate) his or her actual award based on the date of termination and such other considerations as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate. If a participant terminates employment with the Company prior to the end of the applicable performance period due to death, disability or retirement, he or she will be entitled to the payment of the award for the year, provided, however, that the Compensation Committee may reduce (or eliminate) his or her actual award based on such considerations as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate.
 
Awards under the Plan are payable no later than March 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year which includes the last day of the performance period. These awards are generally payable in cash; however, the Compensation Committee reserves the right to declare any award wholly or partially payable in an equivalent amount of Company stock (either fully vested or subject to vesting) issued under the Company's 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan or successor equity compensation plan.
Amendment and Termination of the Plan
The Company's Board may amend or terminate the Plan at any time and for any reason, but in accordance with Section 162(m) of the Code, material amendments to the Plan are subject to stockholder approval. The Plan will also be submitted to stockholders for approval as necessary to enable it to continue to qualify as a performance-based compensation plan under Section 162(m) of the Code.
Assignability and Transferability
Awards under the Plan are not assignable or transferable by the participant, except by will or the laws of inheritance following a participant's death.

As determined by the Committee, the Performance Goals applicable to each Participant shall provide for a targeted level or levels of achievement using one or more of the following measures: (a) annual revenue, (b) budget comparisons, (c) controllable profits, (d) Company earnings per share, (e) expense management, (f) improvements in capital structure, (g) net income, (h) net or gross sales, (i) operating income (pre- or post-tax), (j) profit margins, (k) operating or gross margin, (l) profitability of an identifiable business unit or product, (m) return on investments, (n) return on sales, (o) return on stockholders' equity, (p) total return to stockholders, (q) assets under management, (r) investment management performance, (s) mutual and other investment fund performance, (t) institutional account performance, (u) high net worth and other separate account performance, (v) cash flow, operating cash flow, or cash

Each such adjustment, if any, shall be made solely for the purpose of providing a consistent basis from period to period for the calculation of Performance Goals in order to prevent the dilution or enlargement of the Participant's rights with respect to an Actual Award intended to be performance-based compensation; provided, however, that certain categories or types of such adjustments can be specifically included (rather than excluded) at the time the Performance Goals are established if so determined by the Committee.

Accordingly, an employee who is a Participant for a given Performance Period in no way is guaranteed or assured of being selected for participation in any subsequent Performance Period or Performance Periods.

On or prior to the Determination Date, the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall establish a Payout Formula or Formulae for purposes of determining the Actual Award (if any) payable to each Participant. Each Payout Formula shall (a) be in writing, (b) be based on a comparison of actual performance to the Performance Goals, (c) provide for the payment of a Participant's Target Award if the Performance Goals for the Performance Period are achieved, and (d) provide for an Actual Award greater than or less than the Participant's Target Award, depending upon the extent to which actual performance exceeds or falls below the Performance Goals. Notwithstanding the preceding, no participant's Actual Award under the Plan may exceed the Maximum Award.
Determination of Payout Formula or Formulae
3.6 After the end of each Performance Period, the Committee shall certify in writing the extent to which the Performance Goals applicable to each Participant for the Performance Period were achieved or exceeded. The Actual Award for each Participant shall be determined by applying the Payout Formula to the level of actual performance which has been certified by the Committee. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may eliminate or reduce the Actual Award payable to any Participant below that which otherwise would be payable under the Payout Formula.
Determination of Actual Awards.
3.7 If a Participant terminates employment with the Company for any reason after the end of the applicable Performance Period but prior to the date the Actual Award for such Performance Period is paid, the Participant shall be entitled to the payment of the Actual Award for the Performance Period subject to reduction or elimination under Section 3.6 based on the circumstances surrounding such termination of employment.
Termination Prior to the Date the Actual Award for the Performance Period is Paid.
3.8 If a Participant terminates employment with the Company prior to the end of the applicable Performance Period for any reason other than death, Disability or Retirement, the Committee shall reduce the Participant's Actual Award proportionately based on the date of termination (and subject to further reduction or elimination under Section 3.6 based on the circumstances surrounding such termination of employment).

Termination Prior to the End of the Performance Period Due to Death, Disability or Retirement.
 
3.10 If a Participant is on a leave of absence at any time during a Performance Period, the Committee may reduce his or her Actual Award proportionately based on the duration of the leave of absence (and subject to further reduction or elimination under Section 3.6).
Leave of Absence.
4.1 . Each Actual Award that may become payable under the Plan shall be paid solely from the general assets of the Company. Nothing in this Plan shall be construed to create a trust or to establish or evidence any Participant's claim of any right other than as an unsecured general creditor with respect to any payment to which he or she may be entitled.
Right to Receive Payment
4.2 . Payment of each Actual Award shall be made no later than March 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year which includes the last day of the Performance Period during which the Award was earned.
Timing of Payment
4.3 . Each Actual Award normally shall be paid in cash (or its equivalent) in a single lump sum. However, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may declare any Actual Award, in whole or in part, payable in the form of a stock bonus granted under the Company's 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (the "2002 Plan") or successor equity compensation plan (subject to the limit on the maximum number of shares that may be issued under the 2002 Plan or successor equity compensation plan and any additional limitations on the maximum number of shares that may be awarded to any individual in any fiscal or calendar year under the 2002 Plan or successor equity compensation plan, as applicable). The number of shares granted shall be determined by dividing the cash amount of the Actual Award by the fair market value of a share of Company common stock on the date that the cash payment otherwise would have been made. For this purpose, "fair market value" shall be defined as provided in the 2002 Plan or successor equity compensation plan. Any shares issued pursuant to a stock bonus granted under the 2002 Plan or successor equity compensation plan may be either fully vested or subject to vesting.
Form of Payment
4.4 The Committee may establish one or more programs under the Plan to permit selected Participants the opportunity to elect to defer receipt of Actual Awards. The Committee may establish the election procedures, the timing of such elections, the mechanisms for payments of, and accrual of interest or other earnings, if any, on amounts so deferred, and such other terms, conditions, rules and procedures that the Committee deems advisable for the administration of any such deferral program.
Other Deferral of Actual Awards.
4.5 . If a Participant dies prior to the payment of an Actual Award earned by him or her for a prior Performance Period, the Actual Award shall be paid to the Participant's Beneficiary. If a Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary or if each person designated as a Beneficiary predeceases the Participant or dies prior to payment of an Actual Award, then the Committee shall direct the payment of such Actual Award to the Participant's estate.
Payment in the Event of Death
 
5.1 . The Plan shall be administered by the Committee.
Committee is the Administrator
5.2 . The Committee shall have all discretion and authority necessary or appropriate to administer the Plan and to interpret the provisions of the Plan, consistent with qualification of the Plan as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m). Any determination, decision or action of the Committee in connection with the construction, interpretation, administration or application of the Plan shall be final, conclusive, and binding upon all persons, and shall be given the maximum deference permitted by law.
Committee Authority
5.3 . The Company shall withhold all applicable taxes from any payment, including any non-U.S., federal, state, and local taxes.
Tax Withholding
5.4 The Committee, in its sole discretion and on such terms and conditions as it may provide, may delegate all or part of its authority and powers under the Plan to one or more directors and/or officers of the Company; provided, however, that the Committee may delegate its authority and powers only to the extent consistent with applicable laws (including the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Code) and the rules and regulations of the principal securities market on which the Company's securities are listed or qualified for trading.
Delegation by the Committee.
6.1 . A Participant shall have no right to assign any interest under this Plan. No award granted under the Plan may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will, by the laws of descent and distribution, or to the limited extent provided in Section 4.5. All rights with respect to an award granted to a Participant shall be available during his or her lifetime only to the Participant.
Nonassignability and Nontransferability
6.2 . The establishment and subsequent operation of the Plan, including eligibility as a Participant, shall not be construed as conferring any legal or other rights upon any Participant for the continuation of his or her employment for any Performance Period or any other period. Generally, employment with the Company is on an at will basis only. Except as may be provided in an employment contract with the Participant, the Company expressly reserves the right, which may be exercised at any time and without regard to when during a Performance Period such exercise occurs, to terminate any individual's employment without cause, and to treat him or her without regard to the effect which such treatment might have upon him or her as a Participant.
No Effect on Employment
 
6.3 . No member of the Committee or the Board, or any officer of the Company, shall be liable for any determination, decision or action made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any award under the Plan.
No Individual Liability
6.4 . If any provision of the Plan is found to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall not affect the other provisions of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed in all respects as if such invalid provision has been omitted. The provisions of the Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, with the exception of California's conflict of laws provisions.
Severability; Governing Law
6.5 . Requirements referring to employment with the Company or payment of awards may, in the Committee's discretion, be performed through the Company or any affiliate of the Company.
Affiliates of the Company

The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, by contract, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or under any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless.
Indemnification.
7.1 . The Board may amend or terminate the Plan at any time and for any reason; provided, however, that if and to the extent required to ensure the Plan's qualification under Code Section 162(m), any such amendment shall be subject to stockholder approval.
Amendment and Termination
 

Exhibit 10.2
The following table sets forth the current annual base salaries of the Named Executive Officers

of Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") as of January 31, 2008.
 
The Named Executive Officers are also eligible to:

Exhibit 10.3
The following information relates to certain performance incentive compensation for the Named Executive Officers of Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") as of January 31, 2008.
1
This information was previously disclosed in the Company's proxy statement for its 2008 annual meeting of stockholders.
. With respect to potential incentive compensation for Gregory E. Johnson, the Company's Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") in fiscal year 2008, the Compensation Committee decided to continue its philosophy of linking the majority of the CEO's potential compensation to the achievement of specified performance measures by the Company. Similar to the structure of fiscal year 2007 incentive compensation, the Committee set performance goals based upon the Company's operating profit margin percentage and the combined average of the percentage growth of diluted earnings per share ("DEPS") and pre-tax operating income when compared to the previous year ("PTOI"). For the purposes of this incentive program, "operating profit margin" is generally defined as operating income divided by total operating revenues, and "pre-tax operating income" is generally defined as total operating revenue less total operating expenses determined on a consolidated basis. The performance targets and potential compensation set by the Committee are included below:
2008 CEO Incentive Compensation
 
As with previous performance awards, the Committee retains its authority and discretion to reduce the CEO's incentive based pay whether or not the Company achieves the financial performance goals set for it.
. During its review of Company performance and incentive compensation for fiscal year 2007, the Compensation Committee reaffirmed its belief that the Company's performance should not only be evaluated on an individual basis, but also in comparison to other companies in its industry. In order to incent the CEO to direct the Company to perform at a high level compared to other companies in its industry, the Committee determined that it was advisable to establish a supplemental long-term component to CEO compensation that was linked to such measures. The Committee has therefore established a new incentive program under which the Company's average performance over the three-year period from fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2010 would be compared to peer companies for the following three measures: (i) net sales growth of U.S. retail open ended funds, (ii) net sales growth of international retail open ended funds, and (iii) Company mutual fund investment performance. The CEO's total potential incentive compensation under these three measures is 24,639 shares of the Company's common stock, subject to meeting the specified performance goals described below.
Supplemental CEO Long-Term Incentive Compensation
 
Under each of the net sales growth measures the CEO has the potential to earn the following compensation if the Company's average performance at the end of fiscal year 2010 ranks within the following ranges when compared with its industry peer groups:
 
Under the fund performance measure, the Company's fund assets are evaluated on whether or not they fall within the top two quartiles of industry peer group fund asset rankings. More specifically if, at the end of fiscal year 2010, the percentage of the Company's fund assets that fall within the top two quartiles is within the following ranges, the CEO has the potential to earn the following compensation:
 
In evaluating performance with regard to each of these measures, the Company will use third-party information sources for industry peer group rankings. For Company mutual fund performance, data as reported by Morningstar, Lipper and MicroPal will be utilized. Peer data as provided by the Investment Company Institute will be used in evaluating U.S. sales flows, and Feri Rating & Research will be the data source for peer international sales flows.
. For fiscal year 2008, the Compensation Committee determined that a portion of the compensation of the named executive officers (excluding the CEO, the "Senior Executives") should also be directly linked to Company-wide performance measures.
2008 Senior Executive Incentive Compensation
The Committee found that while the business unit performance objectives set for individual Senior Executives were an important method in achieving improved overall Company performance, a more direct link between Company-wide performance and compensation would serve to ensure that such executives also remained attentive to the Company's overall performance. The Committee therefore established performance targets (under the Company's amended 2004 Key Executive Incentive Plan) for each Senior Executive that are identical to the CEO's. These financial performance goals and key strategic objectives establish the maximum amount of funding,
 
and also the maximum possible payout for the four Senior Executives for the fiscal year under this plan. The funding opportunity based on performance measures are as outlined below:
 
The maximum dollar amount of the potential incentive compensation payable to each Senior Executive under each of these performance targets is indicated below:

Item 8.01. Other Events
Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") will hold its 2009 annual meeting of stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") on Wednesday, March 11, 2009, at 10:00 a.m., Pacific Standard Time, in the H. L. Jamieson Auditorium, at One Franklin Parkway, Building 920, San Mateo, California. The official notice of the Annual Meeting is expected to be sent in January 2009.
The Annual Meeting is being held more than 30 days after the anniversary of the Company's prior annual meeting of stockholders for fiscal 2007 held on January 31, 2008. As a result of this change in the timing of the Company's annual meeting date, certain notice deadlines provided in the Company's Proxy Statement, dated December 28, 2007, under the heading "Stockholder Proposals and Nominations of Directors at 2009 Annual Meeting" have changed.
If a stockholder intends to present any proposal for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement in accordance with Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for consideration at the Annual Meeting, the proposal must be received by the Secretary of the Company by November 11, 2008. Such proposal must also meet the other requirements of the rules of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission relating to stockholders' proposals.
The Company's Amended and Restated By-laws contain an advance notice of stockholder business and nominations requirement (Section 2.3 of the Amended and Restated By-laws), which generally prescribes the procedures that a stockholder of the Company must follow if the stockholder intends, at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, to nominate a person for election to the Company's Board of Directors or to propose other business to be considered by stockholders. These procedures include, among other things, that the stockholder give timely notice to the Secretary of the Company of the nomination or other proposed business, that the notice contain specified information, and that the stockholder comply with certain other requirements. Generally, in the case of an annual meeting of stockholders, a stockholder's notice in order to be timely must be delivered in writing to the Secretary of the Company, at its principal executive office, not later than the close of business on the 120th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 150th day prior to the first anniversary of the date on which the Company first (i) mailed its notice of annual meeting, proxy statement and proxy or (ii) sent its notice of annual meeting and notice of internet availability of its proxy materials, whichever is earlier, for the immediately preceding year's annual meeting. As specified in the Amended and Restated By-laws, different notice deadlines apply in the case of a special meeting. If a stockholder's nomination or proposal is not in compliance with the procedures set forth in the Amended and Restated By-laws, the Company may disregard such nomination or proposal.
In accordance with the Amended and Restated By-laws, since the date of the Annual Meeting is more than 30 days after the anniversary of the Company's 2008 annual meeting, notice by the stockholder must be delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 150th day prior to the Annual Meeting and not later than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the Annual Meeting. Accordingly, if a stockholder of the Company intends, at the Annual Meeting, to nominate a person for election to the Company's Board of Directors or to propose other business, the stockholder must deliver a notice of such nomination or proposal to the Company's Secretary not later than the close of business on November 11, 2008, and not earlier
than the close of business on October 12, 2008, and comply with the requirements of the Amended and Restated By-Laws. If a stockholder submits a proposal outside of Rule 14a-8 for the Annual Meeting and such proposal is not delivered within the time frame specified in the Amended and Restated By-Laws, the Company's proxy may confer discretionary authority on persons being appointed as proxies on behalf of the Company to vote on such proposal.
Notices should be addressed in writing to: Maria Gray, Corporate Secretary, Franklin Resources, Inc., One Franklin Parkway, San Mateo, CA 94403-1906.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year
 
On December 12, 2008, the Board of Directors (the "Board') of Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") approved an amendment to, and restatement of, the Company's amended and restated by-laws, effective from and after the Company's 2009 annual meeting of stockholders to be held on March 11, 2009 (the "Annual Meeting").
The amendment, which changes Section 3.1 of the by-laws, will decrease the authorized number of directors on the Board from 13 to 12. The amendment is being made because a current director, Mr. Louis E. Woodworth, will not be serving as a director from and after the Annual Meeting on account of his ineligibility to be recommended for nomination as a director for a term commencing after his 75th birthday, in accordance with the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines.
The foregoing description of the amendment to the Company's amended and restated by-laws is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the amended and restated by-laws (as adopted on December 12, 2008, and effective on March 11, 2009), which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

(2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of paragraph (a)(1) of this Section 2.3, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation and any such proposed business other than the nomination
of persons for election to the Board of Directors must constitute a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 120th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 150th day prior to the first anniversary of the date on which the Corporation first (i) mailed its notice of annual meeting, proxy statement and proxy or (ii) sent its notice of annual meeting and notice of internet availability of its proxy materials, whichever is earlier, for the immediately preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 30 days after (other than as a result of adjournment) the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 150th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 120th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth: (i) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director (A) all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and (B) such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected; (ii) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the By-Laws of the Corporation, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (iii) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (A) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, (B) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, (C) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (D) a representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group which intends (I) to deliver a proxy statement and proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (II) otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such proposal or nomination. The foregoing notice requirements of this Section 2.3 shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder if the stockholder has notified the Corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal or nomination at an annual

(a) Annual Meetings of Stockholders.
(1) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders only (i) pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto), (ii) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (iii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who was a stockholder of record of the Corporation at the time the notice provided for in this Section 2.3 is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.3.
(2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of paragraph (a)(1) of this Section 2.3, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation and any such proposed business other than the nomination
of persons for election to the Board of Directors must constitute a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 120th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 150th day prior to the first anniversary of the date on which the Corporation first (i) mailed its notice of annual meeting, proxy statement and proxy or (ii) sent its notice of annual meeting and notice of internet availability of its proxy materials, whichever is earlier, for the immediately preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 30 days after (other than as a result of adjournment) the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 150th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 120th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth: (i) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director (A) all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and (B) such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected; (ii) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the By-Laws of the Corporation, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (iii) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (A) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, (B) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, (C) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (D) a representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group which intends (I) to deliver a proxy statement and proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (II) otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such proposal or nomination. The foregoing notice requirements of this Section 2.3 shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder if the stockholder has notified the Corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal or nomination at an annual
 
meeting in compliance with applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act and such stockholder's proposal or nomination has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation.
(3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 2.3 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation specifying the number of directors to be elected or naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least 120 days day prior to the first anniversary of the date on which the Corporation first (i) mailed its notice of annual meeting, proxy statement and proxy or (ii) or sent its notice of annual meeting and notice of internet availability of its proxy materials, whichever is earlier, for the immediately preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 2.3 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.
(b) Special Meetings of Stockholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting (1) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (2) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this Section 2.3 is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and upon such election and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.3. In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 2.3 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 150th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 120th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made by the Corporation of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3, unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present a nomination or proposed business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 2.3, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders.

Section 2.4 . Each annual or special meeting of stockholders shall be held at such location either within or without the State of Delaware as may be determined by the Board of Directors, or if no such determination is made, at such place as may be determined by the Chairman of the Board of Directors. If no location is so determined, any annual or special meeting shall be held at the principal executive office of the Corporation.
Place of Meetings
Section 2.5 . Notice of each annual or special meeting of stockholders shall contain such information, and shall be given to such persons at such time, and in such manner, including without limitation whether by electronic transmission or otherwise, as the Board of Directors shall determine, or if no such determination is made, as the Chairman of the Board shall determine, subject to the requirements of applicable law.
Notice of Meetings
Section 2.6 . Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
Adjournments
Section 2.7 . Subject to the requirements of applicable law, all annual and special meetings of stockholders shall be conducted in accordance with such rules and procedures as the Board of Directors may determine and, as to matters not governed by such rules and procedures, as the Chairman of such meeting shall determine.
Conduct of Meetings
Section 2.8 . The holders of a majority of the shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at a meeting of the stockholders shall constitute a quorum thereat for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by statute, by the Certificate or by these By-Laws. If a quorum is not present or represented at a meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders so present and entitled to vote may, by majority vote, adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in Section 2.6 of these By-Laws until a quorum is present or represented. At any rescheduled meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.
Quorum
Section 2.9 . Any action required by statute to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders, or any action that may be taken at a meeting of the stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior written notice and without a vote if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of the outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize to take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered (by hand or
Action Without Meeting
 
by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested) to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. The signed consent or a signed copy shall be placed in the minute book of the Corporation and prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing.
Section 2.10 . If authorized by the Board in its sole discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board may adopt, stockholders not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may participate in a meeting of stockholders by means of remote communication and be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders, whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication.
Meetings by Remote Communication
Section 2.11 .
Voting; Proxies
(a) One Vote.
Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by him which has voting power upon the matter in question.
(b) Proxies.
Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy pursuant to the previous sentence, a writing signed by the stockholder, a facsimile signed by the stockholder or other electronic transmission from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or by delivering a proxy in accordance with applicable law bearing a later date to the Secretary of the Corporation.
(c) Voting.
Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot and, unless otherwise required by law, need not be conducted by inspectors of election unless so determined by the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon
 
which are present in person or by proxy at such meeting. At all meetings of stockholders for the election of directors, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast; provided, that if as of the record date for such meeting the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors, not exceeding the authorized number of directors as fixed by the Board of Directors in accordance with the Certificate, shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast. For purposes of this Section 2.11(c), a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted for' a director must exceed the number of shares voted against' that director. All other elections and questions shall, unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate or these By-Laws, be decided by the vote of the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter.
Section 2.12 . In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and which record date: (1) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than 60 nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting; (2) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, shall not be more than ten days from the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors; and (3) in the case of any other action, shall not be more than 60 days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed: (1) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; (2) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting when no prior action of the Board of Directors is required by law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation in accordance with applicable law, or, if prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action; and (3) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record
 
Section 2.13 . Shares of the Corporation's stock may be evidenced by certificates for shares of stock or may be issued in uncertificated form in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. The issuance of shares in uncertificated form shall not affect shares already represented by a certificate until the certificate is surrendered to the Corporation.
Certificates; Direct Registration System
Section 2.14 . Transfers of shares of stock of the Corporation shall be made on the books of the Corporation after receipt of a request with proper evidence of succession, assignment, or authority to transfer by the record holder of such stock, or by an attorney lawfully constituted in writing, and in the case of stock represented by a certificate, upon surrender of the certificate.

represent the interests of, the Corporation as a Subsidiary Officer of an Affiliated Entity against expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements) and costs actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless, and except to the extent that, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such judgment was rendered shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses and costs as the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.2, a person shall not be entitled, as a matter of right, to indemnification pursuant to this Section 4.2 against costs and expenses incurred in connection with any action or suit in the right of the Corporation commenced by such person, but such indemnification may be provided by the Corporation in any specific case as permitted by Section 4.6 of this Article.
Section 4.3 . Any indemnification under Section 4.1 or 4.2 of this Article (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director, officer, employee or agent is proper under the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in, Section 4.1 or 4.2 of this Article. Such determination shall be made with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination (i) by a majority vote of the Board of Directors who were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum or (ii) by a committee of such directors (each of whom is not a party to such action, suit or proceeding) designated by majority vote of the Board of Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors or if the disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iv) by the stockholders. In the event a request for indemnification is made by any person referred to in Section 4.1 or Section 4.2 of this Article, the Corporation shall cause such determination to be made not later than 60 days after such request is made.

Such expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by other former directors and officers, employees or agents of the Corporation may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Corporation deems appropriate.
Advance of Expenses
Section 4.6 . The provision of indemnification to, or the advancement of expenses and costs to, any person under this Article, or the entitlement of any person to indemnification or advancement of expenses and costs under this Article, shall not limit or restrict in any way the power of the Corporation to indemnify or advance expenses and costs to such person in any other way permitted by law or be deemed exclusive of, or invalidate, any right to which any person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses and costs may be entitled under any law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person's capacity as an officer, director, employee or agent of the Corporation and as to action to any other capacity while holding any such position.
Indemnification Not Exclusive

Forward-Looking Statements
The financial results in this press release are preliminary. Statements in this press release regarding Franklin Resources, Inc. ("Franklin") and its subsidiaries, which are not historical facts, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this press release, words or phrases generally written in the future tense and/or preceded by words such as "will", "may", "could", "expect", "believe", "anticipate", "intend", "plan", "seek", "estimate" or other similar words are forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors, some of which are listed below, that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance.
 
These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, in Risk Factors and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Franklin's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 and Franklin's subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q:

obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
provided
however
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and
provided
however
 
benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
Default by an Underwriter

however
10. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such delivery and payment (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York

Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal, New York State or California authorities, (iii) a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
11. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

The Representatives named in
Schedule I of the Underwriting
Agreement of the several
Underwriters named Schedule II thereto
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am General Counsel of Franklin Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). The foregoing opinion is being issued in connection with (A) the preparation, execution and delivery of, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by, (i) the Underwriting Agreements dated May 17, 2010 (the "Underwriting Agreements"), among Banc of America Securities LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated as Representatives of the several Underwriters named in Schedule II thereto (the "Underwriters") and the Company and (ii) the Indenture dated as of May 19, 1994, as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of October 9, 1996 and by a second supplemental indenture dated as of May 17, 2010 (the "Indenture") between the Company, as issuer, and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor to Chemical Bank, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), and (B) the issuance and sale by the Company to the Underwriters of $900 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 2.000% Notes due 2013 (the "2013 Notes"), 3.125% Notes due 2015 (the "2015 Notes") and 4.625 Notes due 2020 (the "2020 Notes" and together with the 2013 Notes and the 2015 Notes, the "Securities"). Capitalized terms defined in the Underwriting Agreements and used but not otherwise defined herein are used herein as so defined.
In connection with this opinion, I have examined, to the extent necessary, originals or copies (certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of (i) the Underwriting Agreement, (ii) the Company's automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-149573) filed on March 6, 2008, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Registration Statement"), (iii) the Prospectus, dated as of March 6, 2008 (the "Prospectus"), which forms a part of the Registration Statement, (iv) the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, dated as of May 17, 2010, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement"), (v) the Disclosure Package, (vi) the Prospectus Supplement, dated as of May 17, 2010, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Prospectus Supplement"), (vii) the Indenture, (viii) the form of Note and (ix) such corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments, and such certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company, and have made such inquiries of such officers and representatives, as I have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter set forth.
 
In such examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as certified, conformed or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. As to all questions of fact material to this opinion that have not been independently established, I have relied upon certificates or comparable documents of officers and representatives of the Company and upon the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Underwriting Agreement. As used herein, "to my knowledge" means the conscious awareness of facts or other information by me or other lawyers in the Company's legal department responsible for the matters described herein.
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications stated herein, I am of the opinion that:
1. Each of Templeton Worldwide, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Templeton International, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Franklin Mutual Advisers, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and Franklin/Templeton Distributors, Inc., a New York corporation (each, a "Significant Subsidiary"), is validly existing as a corporation or limited liability company in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation.
2. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or membership units, as applicable, of each Significant Subsidiary are owned, directly or indirectly, of record by the Company. To my knowledge, such shares or membership units, as applicable, are also owned beneficially by the Company and are free and clear of all adverse claims, limitations on voting rights, options and other encumbrances, are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
3. The Company has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties or conducts any business so as to require such qualification, except where the failure of the Company to be so qualified and be in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
4. Other than as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus Supplement, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect and, to my knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened by governmental authorities or by others.
 
The opinions expressed herein are limited to the laws of the State of New York, the corporate laws of the State of Delaware and the federal laws of the United States, and I express no opinion as to the effect on the matters covered by this letter of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
The opinions expressed herein are rendered solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in connection with the transactions described herein. Those opinions may not be used or relied upon by any other person, nor may this letter or any copies thereof be furnished to a third party, filed with a governmental agency, quoted, cited or otherwise referred to without my prior written consent.
 
 
 
May 20, 2010
The Representatives named in
Schedule I of the Underwriting
Agreement of the several
Underwriters named in
Schedule II thereto
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to Franklin Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by, the Underwriting Agreement, dated May 17, 2010, among the Company and you, as representatives of the several Underwriters (the "Underwriters") named in Schedule II thereto (the "Underwriting Agreement"), relating to the issuance and sale by the Company of its 2.000% Notes due 2013 (the "Notes").
The Notes are being issued by the Company under the Indenture, dated as of May 19, 1994, between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor to Chemical Bank, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated October 9, 1996 and a second supplemental indenture dated May 20, 2010 (the "Indenture"). This opinion is being furnished pursuant to paragraph 6(c) of the Underwriting Agreement. The capitalized terms defined in the Underwriting Agreement and used (but not otherwise defined) herein are used as so defined.
In so acting, we have examined originals or copies (certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of (i) the Underwriting Agreement, (ii) the Company's automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-149573) filed on March 6, 2008, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Registration Statement"), (iii) the Prospectus, dated as of March 6, 2008 (the "Prospectus"), which forms a part of the Registration Statement, (iv) the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, dated as of May 17, 2010, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement"), (v) the Disclosure Package, (vi) the Prospectus Supplement, dated as of May 17, 2010, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Prospectus Supplement"), (vii) the Indenture, (viii) the form of Note and (ix) such corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments, and such certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company, and have made such inquiries of such officers and representatives, as we have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter set forth.
In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such
 
latter documents. As to all questions of fact material to these opinions that have not been independently established, we have relied upon certificates or comparable documents of officers and representatives of the Company and upon the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Underwriting Agreement. As used herein, "to our knowledge" and "of which we are aware" mean the conscious awareness of facts or other information by any lawyer in our firm actively involved in the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, after consultation with such other lawyers in our firm, as each such actively involved lawyer has deemed appropriate.
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications stated herein, we are of the opinion that:
The Company is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus Supplement.
The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share.
Franklin Advisers, Inc. is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of California.
All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Franklin Advisers, Inc. are owned of record by the Company. To our knowledge, such shares are also owned beneficially by the Company and are free and clear of all adverse claims, limitations on voting rights, options and other encumbrances, and are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
The execution, delivery and performance of the Indenture by the Company have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. The Indenture has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company, has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act, and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee) constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).
The execution, delivery and performance of the Notes by the Company have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. The Notes have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, when paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement (assuming
 
the due authentication and delivery thereof by the Trustee) will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and, enforceable against it in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).
The Registration Statement and any amendments thereto have become effective under the Act; any required filing of the Prospectus and any supplement thereto pursuant to Rule 424(b) has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b). To our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, as amended, has been issued, and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or overtly threatened under the Act.
The execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement by the Company have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company.
The execution and delivery by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture and the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder, including the issuance and sale of the Notes, will not conflict with, constitute a default under or violate (i) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws of the Company, (ii) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any of the documents listed on Schedule A hereto, (iii) New York, Delaware corporate or federal law or regulation (other than federal and state securities or blue sky laws, as to which we express no opinion in this paragraph) or (iv) any judgment, writ, injunction, decree, order or ruling of any court or governmental authority binding on the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries of which we are aware.
No consent, approval, waiver, license or authorization or other action by or filing with any New York, Delaware corporate or federal governmental authority is required in connection with the execution and delivery by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement, the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby or the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder, except for filings and other actions required pursuant to federal and state securities or blue sky laws, as to which we express no opinion in this paragraph.
The Company is not and, after giving effect to the issuance and sale of the Notes and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus Supplement, will not be an "investment company," as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the Company is not required to register as an investment adviser with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.
 
The statements made in the Disclosure Package and Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences To Non-U.S. Holders," insofar as such statements purport to constitute summaries of matters of U.S. federal tax law and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, and subject to the limitation set forth therein, fairly summarize the matters referred to therein in all material respects.
The statements made in the Disclosure Package and Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Certain ERISA Considerations," insofar as such statements purport to describe provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or Section 4975 of U.S. federal tax law and regulations thereunder, and subject to the limitation set forth therein, fairly describe the provisions to the extent referred to therein in all material respects.
The statements made in the Disclosure Package and Prospectus Supplement under the captions "Description of Debt Securities," "Plan of Distribution" and "Description of the Notes," insofar as such statements constitute summaries of legal matters, documents or proceedings referred to therein, fairly present the information called for with respect to such legal matters, documents and proceedings and fairly summarize the matters referred to therein in all material respects.
The opinions expressed herein are limited to the laws of the State of New York, the corporate laws of the State of Delaware and the State of California and the federal laws of the United States, and we express no opinion as to the effect on the matters covered by this letter of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
The opinions expressed herein are rendered solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in connection with the transactions described herein. Those opinions may not be used or relied upon by any other person, nor may this letter or any copies thereof be furnished to a third party, filed with a governmental agency, quoted, cited or otherwise referred to without our prior written consent.

Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
8. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, as such term is defined in Rule 501(b) under the Act, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such
Indemnification and Contribution
 
losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, (ii) under the heading "Underwriting", (A) the first paragraph, (B) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (C) the fourth paragraph related to concessions and reallowances, (D) the sixth and seventh paragraphs related to stabilization and syndicate covering transactions and (E) the third sentence of the tenth paragraph related to allocation of the Securities in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any
 
obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
provided
however
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and
provided
however
 
benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
Default by an Underwriter
provided
however
10. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such delivery and payment (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York

11. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

The Representatives named in
Schedule I of the Underwriting
Agreement of the several

Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am General Counsel of Franklin Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

In connection with this opinion, I have examined, to the extent necessary, originals or copies (certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of (i) the Underwriting Agreement, (ii) the Company's automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-149573) filed on March 6, 2008, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Registration Statement"), (iii) the Prospectus, dated as of March 6, 2008 (the "Prospectus"), which forms a part of the Registration Statement, (iv) the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, dated as of May 17, 2010, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement"), (v) the Disclosure Package, (vi) the Prospectus Supplement, dated as of May 17, 2010, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Prospectus Supplement"), (vii) the Indenture, (viii) the form of Note and (ix) such corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments, and such certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company, and have made such inquiries of such officers and representatives, as I have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter set forth.
 
In such examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as certified, conformed or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. As to all questions of fact material to this opinion that have not been independently established, I have relied upon certificates or comparable documents of officers and representatives of the Company and upon the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Underwriting Agreement.

The Company has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties or conducts any business so as to require such qualification, except where the failure of the Company to be so qualified and be in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
4. Other than as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus Supplement, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect and, to my knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened by governmental authorities or by others.
 
The opinions expressed herein are limited to the laws of the State of New York, the corporate laws of the State of Delaware and the federal laws of the United States, and I express no opinion as to the effect on the matters covered by this letter of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

The Representatives named in
Schedule I of the Underwriting
Agreement of the several
Underwriters named in
Schedule II thereto
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to Franklin Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by, the Underwriting Agreement, dated May 17, 2010, among the Company and you, as representatives of the several Underwriters (the "Underwriters") named in Schedule II thereto (the "Underwriting Agreement"), relating to the issuance and sale by the Company of its 3.125% Notes due 2015 (the "Notes").
The Notes are being issued by the Company under the Indenture, dated as of May 19, 1994, between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor to Chemical Bank, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated October 9, 1996 and a second supplemental indenture dated May 20, 2010 (the "Indenture"). This opinion is being furnished pursuant to paragraph 6(c) of the Underwriting Agreement. The capitalized terms defined in the Underwriting Agreement and used (but not otherwise defined) herein are used as so defined.
In so acting, we have examined originals or copies (certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of (i) the Underwriting Agreement, (ii) the Company's automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-149573) filed on March 6, 2008, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Registration Statement"), (iii) the Prospectus, dated as of March 6, 2008 (the "Prospectus"), which forms a part of the Registration Statement, (iv) the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, dated as of May 17, 2010, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement"), (v) the Disclosure Package, (vi) the Prospectus Supplement, dated as of May 17, 2010, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Prospectus Supplement"), (vii) the Indenture, (viii) the form of Note and (ix) such corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments, and such certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company, and have made such inquiries of such officers and representatives, as we have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter set forth.
 
In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. As to all questions of fact material to these opinions that have not been independently established, we have relied upon certificates or comparable documents of officers and representatives of the Company and upon the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Underwriting Agreement. As used herein, "to our knowledge" and "of which we are aware" mean the conscious awareness of facts or other information by any lawyer in our firm actively involved in the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, after consultation with such other lawyers in our firm, as each such actively involved lawyer has deemed appropriate.
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications stated herein, we are of the opinion that:
The Company is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus Supplement.
The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share.
Franklin Advisers, Inc. is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of California.
All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Franklin Advisers, Inc. are owned of record by the Company. To our knowledge, such shares are also owned beneficially by the Company and are free and clear of all adverse claims, limitations on voting rights, options and other encumbrances, and are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
The execution, delivery and performance of the Indenture by the Company have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. The Indenture has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company, has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act, and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee) constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).
 
The execution, delivery and performance of the Notes by the Company have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. The Notes have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, when paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement (assuming the due authentication and delivery thereof by the Trustee) will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and, enforceable against it in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).
The Registration Statement and any amendments thereto have become effective under the Act; any required filing of the Prospectus and any supplement thereto pursuant to Rule 424(b) has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b). To our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, as amended, has been issued, and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or overtly threatened under the Act.
The execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement by the Company have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company.
The execution and delivery by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture and the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder, including the issuance and sale of the Notes, will not conflict with, constitute a default under or violate (i) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws of the Company, (ii) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any of the documents listed on Schedule A hereto, (iii) New York, Delaware corporate or federal law or regulation (other than federal and state securities or blue sky laws, as to which we express no opinion in this paragraph) or (iv) any judgment, writ, injunction, decree, order or ruling of any court or governmental authority binding on the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries of which we are aware.
No consent, approval, waiver, license or authorization or other action by or filing with any New York, Delaware corporate or federal governmental authority is required in connection with the execution and delivery by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement, the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby or the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder, except for filings and other actions required pursuant to federal and state securities or blue sky laws, as to which we express no opinion in this paragraph.
 
The Company is not and, after giving effect to the issuance and sale of the Notes and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus Supplement, will not be an "investment company," as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the Company is not required to register as an investment adviser with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.
The statements made in the Disclosure Package and Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences To Non-U.S. Holders," insofar as such statements purport to constitute summaries of matters of U.S. federal tax law and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, and subject to the limitation set forth therein, fairly summarize the matters referred to therein in all material respects.
The statements made in the Disclosure Package and Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Certain ERISA Considerations," insofar as such statements purport to describe provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or Section 4975 of U.S. federal tax law and regulations thereunder, and subject to the limitation set forth therein, fairly describe the provisions to the extent referred to therein in all material respects.
The statements made in the Disclosure Package and Prospectus Supplement under the captions "Description of Debt Securities," "Plan of Distribution" and "Description of the Notes," insofar as such statements constitute summaries of legal matters, documents or proceedings referred to therein, fairly present the information called for with respect to such legal matters, documents and proceedings and fairly summarize the matters referred to therein in all material respects.

(h) The Company agrees that, unless it has or shall have obtained the prior written consent of the Representatives, and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees with the Company that, unless it has or shall have obtained, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433, other than a free writing prospectus containing the information contained in the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto; provided that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule III hereto and any electronic road show, if any. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives or the Company is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus."

(j) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities.

Indemnification and Contribution
 
losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, (ii) under the heading "Underwriting", (A) the first paragraph, (B) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (C) the fourth paragraph related to concessions and reallowances, (D) the sixth and seventh paragraphs related to stabilization and syndicate covering transactions and (E) the third sentence of the tenth paragraph related to allocation of the Securities in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any
 
obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
provided
however
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and
provided
however
 
benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
Default by an Underwriter
provided
however
10. .

The Representatives named in

Agreement of the several
Underwriters named Schedule II thereto
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am General Counsel of Franklin Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). The foregoing opinion is being issued in connection with (A) the preparation, execution and delivery of, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by, (i) the Underwriting Agreements dated May 17, 2010 (the "Underwriting Agreements"), among Banc of America Securities LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated as Representatives of the several Underwriters named in Schedule II thereto (the "Underwriters") and the Company and (ii) the Indenture dated as of May 19, 1994, as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of October 9, 1996 and by a second supplemental indenture dated as of May 17, 2010 (the "Indenture") between the Company, as issuer, and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor to Chemical Bank, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), and (B) the issuance and sale by the Company to the Underwriters of $900 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 2.000% Notes due 2013 (the "2013 Notes"), 3.125% Notes due 2015 (the "2015 Notes") and 4.625 Notes due 2020 (the "2020 Notes" and together with the 2013 Notes and the 2015 Notes, the "Securities"). Capitalized terms defined in the Underwriting Agreements and used but not otherwise defined herein are used herein as so defined.
In connection with this opinion, I have examined, to the extent necessary, originals or copies (certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of (i) the Underwriting Agreement, (ii) the Company's automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-149573) filed on March 6, 2008, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Registration Statement"), (iii) the Prospectus, dated as of March 6, 2008 (the "Prospectus"), which forms a part of the Registration Statement, (iv) the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, dated as of May 17, 2010, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement"), (v) the Disclosure Package, (vi) the Prospectus Supplement, dated as of May 17, 2010, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Prospectus Supplement"), (vii) the Indenture, (viii) the form of Note and (ix) such corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments, and such certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company, and have made such inquiries of such officers and representatives, as I have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter set forth.
 
In such examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as certified, conformed or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. As to all questions of fact material to this opinion that have not been independently established, I have relied upon certificates or comparable documents of officers and representatives of the Company and upon the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Underwriting Agreement. As used herein, "to my knowledge" means the conscious awareness of facts or other information by me or other lawyers in the Company's legal department responsible for the matters described herein.
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications stated herein, I am of the opinion that:
1. Each of Templeton Worldwide, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Templeton International, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Franklin Mutual Advisers, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and Franklin/Templeton Distributors, Inc., a New York corporation (each, a "Significant Subsidiary"), is validly existing as a corporation or limited liability company in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation.
2. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or membership units, as applicable, of each Significant Subsidiary are owned, directly or indirectly, of record by the Company. To my knowledge, such shares or membership units, as applicable, are also owned beneficially by the Company and are free and clear of all adverse claims, limitations on voting rights, options and other encumbrances, are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
3. The Company has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties or conducts any business so as to require such qualification, except where the failure of the Company to be so qualified and be in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
4. Other than as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus Supplement, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect and, to my knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened by governmental authorities or by others.
 
The opinions expressed herein are limited to the laws of the State of New York, the corporate laws of the State of Delaware and the federal laws of the United States, and I express no opinion as to the effect on the matters covered by this letter of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
The opinions expressed herein are rendered solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in connection with the transactions described herein. Those opinions may not be used or relied upon by any other person, nor may this letter or any copies thereof be furnished to a third party, filed with a governmental agency, quoted, cited or otherwise referred to without my prior written consent.
 
 
The Representatives named in
Schedule I of the Underwriting
Agreement of the several
Underwriters named in
Schedule II thereto
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to Franklin Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by, the Underwriting Agreement, dated May 17, 2010, among the Company and you, as representatives of the several Underwriters (the "Underwriters") named in Schedule II thereto (the "Underwriting Agreement"), relating to the issuance and sale by the Company of its 4.625% Notes due 2020 (the "Notes").
The Notes are being issued by the Company under the Indenture, dated as of May 19, 1994, between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor to Chemical Bank, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated October 9, 1996 and a second supplemental indenture dated May 20, 2010 (the "Indenture"). This opinion is being furnished pursuant to paragraph 6(c) of the Underwriting Agreement. The capitalized terms defined in the Underwriting Agreement and used (but not otherwise defined) herein are used as so defined.
In so acting, we have examined originals or copies (certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of (i) the Underwriting Agreement, (ii) the Company's automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-149573) filed on March 6, 2008, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Registration Statement"), (iii) the Prospectus, dated as of March 6, 2008 (the "Prospectus"), which forms a part of the Registration Statement, (iv) the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, dated as of May 17, 2010, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement"), (v) the Disclosure Package, (vi) the Prospectus Supplement, dated as of May 17, 2010, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Prospectus Supplement"), (vii) the Indenture, (viii) the form of Note and (ix) such corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments, and such certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company, and have made such inquiries of such officers and representatives, as we have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter set forth.
 
In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. As to all questions of fact material to these opinions that have not been independently established, we have relied upon certificates or comparable documents of officers and representatives of the Company and upon the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Underwriting Agreement. As used herein, "to our knowledge" and "of which we are aware" mean the conscious awareness of facts or other information by any lawyer in our firm actively involved in the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, after consultation with such other lawyers in our firm, as each such actively involved lawyer has deemed appropriate.
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications stated herein, we are of the opinion that:
The Company is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus Supplement.
The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share.
Franklin Advisers, Inc. is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of California.
All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Franklin Advisers, Inc. are owned of record by the Company. To our knowledge, such shares are also owned beneficially by the Company and are free and clear of all adverse claims, limitations on voting rights, options and other encumbrances, and are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
The execution, delivery and performance of the Indenture by the Company have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. The Indenture has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company, has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act, and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee) constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).
 
The execution, delivery and performance of the Notes by the Company have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. The Notes have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, when paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement (assuming the due authentication and delivery thereof by the Trustee) will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and, enforceable against it in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).
The Registration Statement and any amendments thereto have become effective under the Act; any required filing of the Prospectus and any supplement thereto pursuant to Rule 424(b) has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b). To our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, as amended, has been issued, and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or overtly threatened under the Act.
The execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement by the Company have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company.
The execution and delivery by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture and the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder, including the issuance and sale of the Notes, will not conflict with, constitute a default under or violate (i) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws of the Company, (ii) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any of the documents listed on Schedule A hereto, (iii) New York, Delaware corporate or federal law or regulation (other than federal and state securities or blue sky laws, as to which we express no opinion in this paragraph) or (iv) any judgment, writ, injunction, decree, order or ruling of any court or governmental authority binding on the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries of which we are aware.
No consent, approval, waiver, license or authorization or other action by or filing with any New York, Delaware corporate or federal governmental authority is required in connection with the execution and delivery by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement, the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby or the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder, except for filings and other actions required pursuant to federal and state securities or blue sky laws, as to which we express no opinion in this paragraph.
 
The Company is not and, after giving effect to the issuance and sale of the Notes and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus Supplement, will not be an "investment company," as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the Company is not required to register as an investment adviser with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.
The statements made in the Disclosure Package and Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences To Non-U.S. Holders," insofar as such statements purport to constitute summaries of matters of U.S. federal tax law and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, and subject to the limitation set forth therein, fairly summarize the matters referred to therein in all material respects.

To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 120th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 150th day prior to the first anniversary of the date on which the Corporation first (i) mailed its notice of annual meeting, proxy statement and proxy or (ii) sent its notice of annual meeting and notice of internet availability of its proxy materials, whichever is earlier, for the immediately preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 30 days after (other than as a result of adjournment) the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 150th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 120th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth: (i) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director (A) all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and (B) such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected; (ii) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws of the Corporation, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (iii) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (A) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, (B) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, (C) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to the nomination or proposal between or among such stockholder and/or such beneficial owner, any of their respective affiliates or associates, and any others acting in concert with any of the foregoing, including, in the case of a nomination, the nominee, (D) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, warrants, convertible securities, stock appreciation or similar rights, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares) that has been entered into as of the date of the stockholder's notice by, or on behalf of, such stockholder and such beneficial owners, whether or not such instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in underlying shares of capital stock of the Corporation, the
 
effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, manage risk or benefit of share price changes for, or increase or decrease the voting power of, such stockholder or such beneficial owner, with respect to securities of the Corporation, (E) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, (F) a representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group which intends (I) to deliver a proxy statement and proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (II) otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such proposal or nomination, and (G) any other information relating to such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the proposal and/or for the election of directors in an election contest pursuant to and in accordance with Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The foregoing notice requirements of this paragraph (a) of this Section 2.3 shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder with respect to business other than a nomination if the stockholder has notified the Corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act and such stockholder's proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation.
(3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 2.3 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors at an annual meeting is increased effective after the time period for which nominations would otherwise be due under paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 2.3 and there is no public announcement by the Corporation specifying the number of directors to be elected or naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least 120 days day prior to the first anniversary of the date on which the Corporation first (i) mailed its notice of annual meeting, proxy statement and proxy or (ii) or sent its notice of annual meeting and notice of internet availability of its proxy materials, whichever is earlier, for the immediately preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 2.3 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.
(b) Special Meetings of Stockholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting.

In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 2.3 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 150th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 120th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made by the Corporation of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.

Except as otherwise provided by law, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (i) to determine whether a stockholder nomination or any business proposed by a stockholder to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.3 (including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of such stockholder's nominee or proposal in compliance with such stockholder's representation as required by clause (a)(2)(iii)(F) of this Section 2.3) and (ii) if any such proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this Section 2.3, to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3, unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present a nomination or proposed business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted,
 
notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 2.3, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders.
(2) For purposes of this Section 2.3, "public announcement" shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 2.3; provided however, that any references in these Bylaws to the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit any requirements applicable to nominations or proposals as to any other business to be considered pursuant to this Section 2.3 (including paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) and (b) hereof), and compliance with paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) and (b) of this Section 2.3 shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations or submit other business (other than, as provided in the penultimate sentence of (a)(2), business other than nominations brought properly under and in compliance with Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act, as may be amended from time to time). Nothing in this Section 2.3 shall be deemed to affect any rights (i) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals or nominations in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect directors pursuant to any applicable provisions of the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate").

If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix as the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record as of the record date so fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting

Conduct of Meetings
(a) Subject to the requirements of applicable law, all annual and special meetings of stockholders shall be conducted in accordance with such rules and procedures as the Board of Directors may determine and, as to matters not governed by such rules and procedures, as the chairman of such meeting or such other person presiding over such meeting shall determine.
(b) Except to the extent inconsistent with any rules and regulations as may be adopted by the Board of Directors, the presiding person at any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to convene and (for any or no reason) to adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such presiding person, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the presiding person of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the presiding person of the meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (v) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. The presiding person at any meeting of stockholders, in addition to making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a matter or business was not properly brought before the meeting and if such presiding person should so determine, such presiding person shall so declare to the meeting and any such matter or business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted or considered. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the person presiding over the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.
 
Section 2.8 . The holders of a majority in voting power of the shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at a meeting of the stockholders shall constitute a quorum thereat for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by statute, by the Certificate or by these Bylaws. If a quorum is not present or represented at a meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders so present and entitled to vote may, by a majority in voting power, adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in Section 2.6 of these Bylaws until a quorum is present or represented. At any rescheduled meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.
Quorum
Section 2.9 . Any action required by statute to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders, or any action that may be taken at a meeting of the stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior written notice and without a vote if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of the outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize to take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered (by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested) to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. The signed consent or a signed copy shall be placed in the minute book of the Corporation and prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing.
Action Without Meeting
Section 2.10 . If authorized by the Board in its sole discretion, and in accordance with applicable law and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board may adopt, stockholders not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may participate in a meeting of stockholders by means of remote communication and be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders, whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication.
Meetings by Remote Communication
Section 2.11 .
Voting; Proxies
(a) One Vote.
Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by him which has voting power upon the matter in question.
(b) Proxies.
Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.
 
Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy pursuant to the previous sentence, a writing signed by the stockholder, a facsimile signed by the stockholder or other electronic transmission from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or by delivering a proxy in accordance with applicable law bearing a later date to the Secretary of the Corporation.
(c) Voting.
Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot and, unless otherwise required by law, need not be conducted by inspectors of election unless so determined by the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the voting power which could be cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon which are present in person or by proxy at such meeting. At all meetings of stockholders for the election of directors, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast; provided, that if as of the record date for such meeting the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast. For purposes of this Section 2.11(c), a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted for' a director must exceed the number of shares voted against' that director. All other elections and questions shall, unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate or these Bylaws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, or applicable law or pursuant to any regulation applicable to the Corporation or its securities, be decided by the vote of the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the voting power present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in these Bylaws, (x) the non-binding advisory vote with respect to executive compensation pursuant to Section 14A(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, shall require the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast thereon, and (y) the non-binding advisory vote, pursuant to Section 14A(a)(2) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, with respect to the determination as to whether the vote described in the preceding clause (x) shall occur every one (1), two (2) or three (3) years shall be decided by a plurality of the votes cast; provided that for purposes of any vote required pursuant to this sentence, neither abstentions nor broker non-votes shall count as votes cast.
Section 2.12 . In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or
Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record

If no record date is fixed: (1) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; (2) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting when no prior action of the Board of Directors is required by law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation in accordance with applicable law, or, if prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action; and (3) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting.
Section 2.13 . Shares of the Corporation's stock may be evidenced by certificates for shares of stock or may be issued in uncertificated form in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. The issuance of shares in uncertificated form shall not affect shares already represented by a certificate until the certificate is surrendered to the Corporation.

Section 2.14 . Transfers of shares of stock of the Corporation shall be made on the books of the Corporation after receipt of a request with proper evidence of succession, assignment, or authority to transfer by the record holder of such stock, or by an attorney lawfully constituted in writing, and in the case of stock represented by a certificate, upon surrender of the certificate.

Indemnification Respecting Derivative Claims
 
circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses and costs as the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.2, a person shall not be entitled, as a matter of right, to indemnification pursuant to this Section 4.2 against costs and expenses incurred in connection with any action or suit in the right of the Corporation (or part thereof) commenced by such person, but such indemnification may be provided by the Corporation in any specific case as permitted by Section 4.6 of this Article.
Section 4.3 . Any indemnification under Section 4.1 or 4.2 of this Article (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director, officer or employee is proper under the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in, Section 4.1 or 4.2 of this Article. Such determination shall be made with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination (i) by a majority vote of the Board of Directors who were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum or (ii) by a committee of such directors (each of whom is not a party to such action, suit or proceeding) designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors or if the disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iv) by the stockholders. In the event a request for indemnification is made by any person referred to in Section 4.1 or Section 4.2 of this Article, the Corporation shall cause such determination to be made not later than 60 days after such request is made.

statement requesting such indemnification, averring such service and reasonably evidencing such expenses and costs.
Section 4.5 . Expenses (including attorneys' fees) and costs incurred by an officer or director of the Corporation in defending a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized by this Article. Such expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by other former directors and officers or employees of the Corporation may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Corporation deems appropriate.
Advance of Expenses
Section 4.6 . The provision of indemnification to, or the advancement of expenses and costs to, any person under this Article, or the entitlement of any person to indemnification or advancement of expenses and costs under this Article, shall not limit or restrict in any way the power of the Corporation to indemnify or advance expenses and costs to such person in any other way permitted by law or be deemed exclusive of, or invalidate, any right to which any person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses and costs may be entitled under any Bylaw, law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person's capacity as an officer, director or employee of the Corporation and as to action to any other capacity while holding any such position.
Indemnification Not Exclusive

The right of any person who is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation to indemnification under this Article shall continue after he shall have ceased to be a director, officer or employee and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, distributees, executors, administrators and other legal representatives of such person.
Accrual of Claims; Successors
Section 4.8 .

Forward-Looking Statements
The financial results in this press release are preliminary. Statements in this press release regarding Franklin Resources, Inc. ("Franklin") and its subsidiaries, which are not historical facts, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this press release, words or phrases generally written in the future tense and/or preceded by words such as "will", "may", "could", "expect", "believe", "anticipate", "intend", "plan", "seek", "estimate" or other similar words are forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors, some of which are listed below, that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance.
These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, in Risk Factors and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Franklin's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010:
 
 
Any forward-looking statement made by us in this press release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them.

(e) At the annual meeting of the stockholders of Franklin Resources, Inc.

A summary of the material terms of the Plan is set forth in the Company's definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 25, 2011 (the "Proxy Statement") under the heading "Proposal No. 3 Approval of an Amendment and Restatement of the Franklin Resources, Inc. 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan." The summary in the Proxy Statement and the description of the Plan contained herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Plan which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.
Item 5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
The matters voted upon at the Annual Meeting and the results of the votes were as follows:
 
 
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
 
1.1 . The Franklin Resources, Inc. 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (the "2002 Stock Plan") has been established by Franklin Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company") to (i) attract and retain persons eligible to participate in the 2002 Stock Plan; (ii) motivate employees, by means of appropriate incentives, to achieve long-range performance goals; (iii) provide incentive compensation opportunities that are competitive with those of other similar companies; and (iv) further identify employees' interests with those of the Company's other stockholders through compensation that is based on the Company's common stock; and thereby promote the long-term financial interest of the Company and the Subsidiaries.
Purpose
1.2 . Subject to the terms and conditions of the 2002 Stock Plan, the Committee shall determine and designate, from time to time, from among the Participants, those persons who will be granted one or more Awards under the 2002 Stock Plan. In the discretion of the Committee, a Participant may be granted any Award permitted under the provisions of the 2002 Stock Plan, and more than one Award may be granted to a Participant. Awards may be granted as alternatives to or replacement of awards outstanding under the 2002 Stock Plan, or any other plan or arrangement of the Company or a Subsidiary (including a plan or arrangement of a business or entity, all or a portion of which is acquired by the Company or a Subsidiary).
Participation
1.3 . The operation and administration of the 2002 Stock Plan, including the Awards made under the 2002 Stock Plan, shall be subject to the provisions of Section 4 (relating to operation and administration). Capitalized terms in the 2002 Stock Plan shall be defined as set forth in the 2002 Stock Plan (including the definition provisions of Section 8 of the 2002 Stock Plan).
Operation, Administration, and Definitions
1.4 . Subject to the provisions of this Section 1.4 and Section 6.1 of the 2002 Stock Plan, the maximum aggregate number of shares which may be delivered pursuant to Awards, including without limitation, Options and SAR's granted under the 2002 Stock Plan, is 40,000,000. The shares may be authorized, but unissued, or reacquired Common Stock.
Stock Subject to 2002 Stock Plan; Share Counting
(a) To the extent any Shares covered by an Award are not delivered to a Participant or beneficiary because the Award is forfeited or canceled, or the Shares are not delivered because the Award is settled in cash, such Shares shall not be deemed to have been delivered for purposes of determining the maximum number of Shares available for delivery pursuant to Awards granted under the 2002 Stock Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary herein, all Shares covered by the portion of a SAR that is exercised (whether or not Shares are actually issued to the Participant upon exercise of the SAR) shall be considered issued pursuant to the 2002 Stock Plan.
(b) If the exercise price of any Option granted under the 2002 Stock Plan is satisfied by tendering Shares to the Company (by either actual delivery or by attestation), only the number of Shares issued net of the Shares tendered shall be deemed delivered for purposes of determining the maximum number of Shares available for delivery pursuant to Awards (other than Options) granted under the 2002 Stock Plan.
(c) Subject to adjustment under Section 6.1, (i) the maximum number of shares that may be granted to any one individual pursuant to Section 2 (relating to Options and SARs) shall be 400,000 Shares during any one-calendar-year period and (ii) the maximum number of Shares that may be granted to any one individual subject to Section 3 (relating to Stock Unit Awards, Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Unit Awards and Performance Share Awards) shall be 1,000,000 Shares during any one-calendar-year period (regardless of when such Shares are deliverable).
 
2.1 .
Options
(a) An Option is a grant of rights to purchase Shares at an exercise price established by the Committee, subject to Section 2.3. Options granted under this Section 2 may be either Incentive Stock Options ("ISO") or Nonstatutory Stock Options ("NSO"), as determined in the discretion of the Committee.
(b) Each Option shall be designated in the written option agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. However, notwithstanding such designations, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Options designated as Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any Optionee during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, such excess Options shall be automatically treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For purposes of this paragraph 2.1(b), Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted, and the Fair Market Value of the Shares shall be determined as of the original date the Option with respect to such Shares is granted. In the event that the Code or the regulations promulgated thereunder are amended after the date the 2002 Stock Plan becomes effective to provide for a different limit on the Fair Market Value of Shares permitted to be subject to Incentive Stock Options, then such different limit will be automatically incorporated herein and will apply to any Options granted after the effective date of such amendment.
(c) The term of each Option shall be the term stated in the Option Agreement; provided, however, that in the case of any Incentive Stock Option, the term shall be no more than ten (10) years from the date of grant thereof or such shorter term as may be provided in the Option Agreement. However, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Optionee who, at the time the Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Option shall be five (5) years from the date of grant thereof or such shorter term as may be provided in the Option Agreement.
(d) The date of grant of an Option shall, for all purposes, be the date on which the Committee makes the determination granting such Option, or such other date as is determined by the Committee. Notice of the determination shall be given to each Participant to whom an Option is so granted within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.
2.2 . A "Stock Appreciation Right" ("SAR") is a grant of rights to receive, in cash or Stock (as determined by the Committee), value equal to (or otherwise based on) the excess of: (a) the Fair Market Value of a specified number of Shares at the time of exercise; over (b) a base appreciation amount established by the Committee, subject to Section 2.3.
Stock Appreciation Rights
2.3 . The exercise price or base appreciation amount (as applicable) of each Option and SAR shall be established by the Committee or shall be determined by a method established by the Committee at the time the Option or SAR is granted; provided that:
Exercise Price
(a) In the case of an ISO,
(i) granted to an employee who, at the time of the grant of such Incentive Stock Option, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant;
(ii) granted to any other employee, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
(b) In the case of a NSO, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
(c) In the case of a SAR, the base appreciation amount shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
2.4 . Options and SARs shall be exercisable in accordance with such terms and conditions and during such periods as may be established by the Committee; subject to the following terms regarding Options:
Time and Manner of Exercise
 
(a) . In the event of termination of an Optionee's Continuous Status as an employee with the Company, such Optionee may, but only within ninety (90) days after the date of such termination (or such other period as is set out by the Committee in the Option Agreement, but in no event later than the expiration date of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement), exercise the Option to the extent that Optionee was entitled to exercise it at the date of such termination. To the extent that Optionee was not entitled to exercise the Option at the date of such termination, or if Optionee does not exercise such Option to the extent so entitled within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate.
Termination of Employment
(b) . Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2.4(a) above, in the event of termination of an Optionee's Continuous Status as an employee as a result of disability (as determined by the Committee in accordance with the policies of the Company), Optionee may, but only within six (6) months from the date of such termination (or such other period as is set out by the Committee in the Option Agreement, but in no event later than the expiration date of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement), exercise the Option to the extent otherwise entitled to exercise it at the date of such termination. To the extent that Optionee was not entitled to exercise the Option at the date of termination, or if Optionee does not exercise such Option to the extent so entitled within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate.
Disability of Optionee
(c) . In the event of the death of an Optionee, the Option may be exercised, at any time within twelve (12) months following the date of death (or such other period as is set out by the Committee in the Option Agreement, but in no event later than the expiration date of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement), by the Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent the Optionee was entitled to exercise the Option at the date of death. To the extent that Optionee was not entitled to exercise the Option at the date of termination, or if Optionee does not exercise such Option to the extent so entitled within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate.
Death of Optionee
2.5 . Payment of the exercise price of an Option shall be subject to the following:
Payment of Exercise Price
(a) The full exercise price for Shares purchased upon the exercise of any Option shall be paid at the time of such exercise (except that, in the case of an exercise arrangement approved by the Committee and described in paragraph 2.5(b), payment may be made as soon as practicable after the exercise).
(b) The consideration to be paid for the Shares to be issued upon exercise of an Option, including the method of payment, shall be determined by the Committee (and, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, shall be determined at the time of grant) and may, in the discretion of the Committee, consist entirely of (i) cash, (ii) check, (iii) delivery of authorization for the Company to retain from the total number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised that number of Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the exercise price for the total number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised, (iv) delivery of a properly executed exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to the Company the amount of sale or loan proceeds required to pay the exercise price, (v) irrevocably authorizing a third party to sell Shares (or a sufficient portion of the shares) acquired upon exercise of the Option and remit to the Company a sufficient portion of the sale proceeds to pay the entire exercise price and any tax withholding resulting from such exercise, (vi) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment, or (vii) such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance of Shares to the extent permitted under Applicable Laws.
2.6 . Shares delivered pursuant to the exercise of an Option or SAR shall be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee may establish in the applicable Award Agreement at the time of grant. Settlement of SARs may be made in Shares (valued at their Fair Market Value at the time of exercise), in cash, or in a combination thereof, as determined in the discretion of the Committee. The Committee, in its discretion, may impose such conditions, restrictions and contingencies with respect to Shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Option or an SAR as the Committee determines to be desirable.
Settlement of Award
 
3.1 .
Definitions
 
(a) A "Stock Unit" Award is the grant of a right to receive Shares in the future.
(b) A "Performance Share" Award is a grant of a right to receive Shares or Stock Units which is contingent on the achievement of performance or other objectives during a specified period.
(c) A "Restricted Stock" Award is a grant of Shares, and a "Restricted Stock Unit" Award is the grant of a right to receive Shares in the future, with such Shares or right to future delivery of such Shares subject to a risk of forfeiture or other restrictions that will lapse upon the achievement of one or more goals relating to completion of service by the Participant, or achievement of performance or other objectives, as determined by the Committee.
3.2 . Each Stock Unit Award, Restricted Stock Award, Restricted Stock Unit Award and Performance Share Award shall be subject to the following:
Restrictions on Stock Awards
(a) Any such Awards shall be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee shall determine.
(b) The Committee may designate whether any such Awards being granted to any Participant are intended to be "performance-based compensation" as that term is used in Section 162(m) of the Code. Any such Awards designated as intended to be "performance-based compensation" shall be conditioned on the achievement of one or more Performance Measures. The Performance Measures that may be used by the Committee for such Awards shall be based on any one or more of the criteria attached hereto on Attachment I, as selected and further defined by the Committee. The Performance Measures may be applicable to the Company and/or any of its individual business units and may differ from Participant to Participant. For Awards intended to be "performance-based compensation," the grant of the Awards and the establishment of the Performance Measures shall be made during the period required under Section 162(m) of the Code and shall be subject to the individual share limit set out in Section 1.4(c) above.
 
4.1 . The 2002 Stock Plan became effective as of October 10, 2002. The 2002 Stock Plan shall be unlimited in duration and, in the event of the 2002 Stock Plan termination, shall remain in effect as long as any Awards under it are outstanding; provided, however, that, to the extent required by the Code, no ISO may be granted under the 2002 Stock Plan after October 9, 2012.
Effective Date
4.2 . Subject to the limitations of Section 2.1(c), the term of each Award under the 2002 Stock Plan shall be the term stated in the applicable Award Agreement, provided, however, that the term shall be no more than ten (10) years from the date of grant thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the specified term of any Award shall not include any period for which the Participant has elected to defer the receipt of the Shares or cash issuable pursuant to the Award.
Term of Awards
4.3 . Delivery of Shares or other amounts under the 2002 Stock Plan shall be subject to the following:
General Restrictions
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of the 2002 Stock Plan, the Company shall have no liability to deliver any Shares under the 2002 Stock Plan or make any other distribution of benefits under the 2002 Stock Plan unless such delivery or distribution would comply with all applicable laws (including, without limitation, the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933), and the applicable requirements of any securities exchange or similar entity.
(b) Shares issued under the 2002 Stock Plan may be certificated or, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange, non-certificated.
4.4 . All distributions under the 2002 Stock Plan are subject to withholding of all applicable taxes, and the Committee may condition the delivery of any Shares or other benefits under the 2002 Stock Plan on satisfaction of the applicable withholding obligations. The Committee, in its discretion, and subject to such requirements as the Committee may impose prior to the occurrence of such withholding, may permit such
Tax Withholding
 
withholding obligations to be satisfied through cash payment by the Participant, through the surrender of Shares which the Participant already owns, or through the surrender of Shares to which the Participant is otherwise entitled under the 2002 Stock Plan, provided; however, that in either case only the number of Shares sufficient to satisfy the Company's minimum required tax withholding obligations may be surrendered to the Company.
4.5 . Subject to the overall limitation on the number of Shares that may be delivered under the 2002 Stock Plan, the Committee may use available Shares as the form of payment for compensation, grants or rights earned or due under any other compensation plans or arrangements of the Company or a Subsidiary, including the plans and arrangements of the Company or a Subsidiary assumed in business combinations.
Use of Shares
4.6 . An Award (including without limitation an Option or SAR Award) may provide the Participant with the right to receive dividend payments or dividend equivalent payments with respect to Stock subject to the Award (both before and after the Stock subject to the Award is earned, vested, or acquired), which payments may be either made currently or credited to an account for the Participant, and may be settled in cash or Stock as determined by the Committee. Any such settlements, and any such crediting of dividends or dividend equivalents or reinvestment in Shares, may be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee shall establish, including the reinvestment of such credited amounts in Stock equivalents.
Dividends and Dividend Equivalents
4.7 . Awards may be settled through cash payments, the delivery of Shares, the granting of replacement Awards, or combination thereof as the Committee shall determine. Any Award settlement, including payment deferrals, may be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee shall determine. The Committee may permit or require the deferral of any Award payment, subject to such rules and procedures as it may establish, which may include provisions for the payment or crediting of interest, or dividend equivalents, including converting such credits into deferred Stock equivalents. Each Subsidiary shall be liable for payment of cash due under the 2002 Stock Plan with respect to any Participant to the extent that such benefits are attributable to the services rendered for that Subsidiary by the Participant. Any disputes relating to liability of a Subsidiary for cash payments shall be resolved by the Committee.
Payments

Limitation of Implied Rights
(a) Neither a Participant nor any other person shall, by reason of participation in the 2002 Stock Plan, acquire any right in or title to any assets, funds or property of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary whatsoever, including, without limitation, any specific funds, assets, or other property which the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, in their sole discretion, may set aside in anticipation of a liability under the 2002 Stock Plan. A Participant shall have only a contractual right to the Stock or amounts, if any, payable under the 2002 Stock Plan, unsecured by any assets of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, and nothing contained in the 2002 Stock Plan shall constitute a guarantee that the assets of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary shall be sufficient to pay any benefits to any person.
(b) The 2002 Stock Plan does not constitute a contract of employment, and selection as a Participant will not give any Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary, nor any right or claim to any benefit under the 2002 Stock Plan, unless such right or claim has specifically accrued under the terms of the 2002 Stock Plan. Except as otherwise provided in the 2002 Stock Plan, no Award under the 2002 Stock Plan shall confer upon the holder thereof any rights as a stockholder of the Company prior to the date on which the individual fulfills all conditions for receipt of such rights.
 
5.1 . The authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the 2002 Stock Plan shall be vested in a committee (the "Committee") in accordance with this Section 5. The Committee shall be selected by the Board, and shall be comprised, unless otherwise determined by the Board, solely of not less than two members of the Board who shall be "outside" directors within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.162-27(e)(3) under Section 162(m) of the Code. With respect to Awards granted under the 2002 Stock Plan that are not intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee shall be composed of two or more members of the Board who are not employees of the Company. If the Committee does not exist, or for any other reason determined by the Board, the Board may take any action under the 2002 Stock Plan that would otherwise be the responsibility of the Committee.
Committee
5.2 . The Committee's administration of the 2002 Stock Plan shall be subject to the following:
Powers of Committee
(a) Subject to the provisions of the 2002 Stock Plan, the Committee will have the authority and discretion to select from among the Participants those persons who shall receive Awards, to determine the time or times of receipt, to determine the types of Awards and the number of shares covered by the Awards, to establish the terms, conditions, performance criteria (provided that, for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code, performance measures shall be based on one or more of the criteria set out on Attachment I hereto), restrictions, and other provisions of such Awards, and (subject to Section 7) to cancel or suspend Awards.
(b) To the extent that the Committee determines that the restrictions imposed by the 2002 Stock Plan preclude the achievement of the material purposes of the Awards in jurisdictions outside the United States, the Committee will have the authority and discretion to modify those restrictions as the Committee determines to be necessary or appropriate to conform to applicable requirements or practices of jurisdictions outside of the United States.
(c) The Committee may grant Awards to Participants who are subject to the tax laws of nations other than the United States, which Awards may have terms and conditions as determined by the Committee as necessary to comply with applicable foreign laws. The Committee may take any action which it deems advisable to obtain approval of such Awards by the appropriate foreign government entity; provided however that no such
 
Awards may be granted under this 2002 Stock Plan and no action may be taken which would result in a violation of the Exchange Act, the Code or any other applicable law.
(d) The Committee will have the authority and discretion to interpret the 2002 Stock Plan, to establish, amend, and rescind any rules and regulations relating to the 2002 Stock Plan, to determine the terms and provisions of any Award Agreement made pursuant to the 2002 Stock Plan, and to make all other determinations that may be necessary or advisable for the administration of the 2002 Stock Plan.
(e) Any interpretation of the 2002 Stock Plan by the Committee and any decision made by it under the 2002 Stock Plan is final and binding on all persons.
(f) In controlling and managing the operation and administration of the 2002 Stock Plan, the Committee shall take action in a manner that conforms to the articles and by-laws of the Company, and applicable state corporate law.
(g) Notwithstanding anything in the 2002 Stock Plan to the contrary, (i) the reduction of the exercise price of any Option awarded under the 2002 Stock Plan and the base appreciation amount of any SAR awarded under the 2002 Stock Plan shall be subject to stockholder approval and (ii) canceling an Option or SAR at a time when its exercise price or base appreciation amount (as applicable) exceeds the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares, in exchange for another Option, SAR, Restricted Stock Award, or other Award shall be subject to stockholder approval, unless the cancellation and exchange occurs in connection with a Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, canceling an Option or SAR in exchange for another Option, SAR, Restricted Stock Award, or other Award with an exercise price, purchase price or base appreciation amount (as applicable) that is equal to or greater than the exercise price or base appreciation amount (as applicable) of the original Option or SAR shall not be subject to stockholder approval.
5.3 . Except to the extent prohibited by Applicable Law or the applicable rules of a stock exchange, the Committee may allocate all or any portion of its responsibilities and powers to any one or more of its members and may delegate all or any part of its ministerial duties to any person or persons selected by it. Any such allocation or delegation may be revoked by the Committee at any time.
Delegation by Committee
5.4 . The Company and its Subsidiaries shall furnish the Committee with such data and information as the Committee determines may be required for it to discharge its duties. The records of the Company and its Subsidiaries as to a Participant's employment, termination of employment, leave of absence, reemployment and compensation shall be conclusive on all persons unless determined to be incorrect. Participants must furnish the Committee such evidence, data or information as the Committee considers desirable to carry out the terms of the 2002 Stock Plan in order to be entitled to benefits under the 2002 Stock Plan.
Information to be Furnished to Committee
 
6.1 . Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company, (a) the number and/or class of securities covered by each outstanding Award, (b) the price per share covered by each such outstanding Award, (c) the number and/or class of securities which have been authorized for issuance under the 2002 Stock Plan but as to which no Awards have yet been granted or which have been returned to the 2002 Stock Plan upon cancellation or expiration of an Award, and (d) the maximum number of Options, SARs, Stock Unit Awards, Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Units Awards and Performance Share Awards which may be granted to any Participant in any one-calendar-year period shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Common Stock, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company, provided, however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration." Such adjustment shall be made by the Committee. The Committee shall also make adjustments described in (a)-(d) of this Section 6.1 in the event of any distribution of cash or other assets to stockholders other than an ordinary cash dividend. In determining adjustments to be made under this Section 6.1, the Committee may take into account such factors as it deems appropriate, including (i) the restrictions of applicable law, (ii) the
Changes in Capitalization
 
potential tax, accounting or other consequences of an adjustment and (iii) the possibility that some Participants might receive an adjustment and a distribution or other unintended benefit, and in light of such factors or circumstances may make adjustments that are not uniform or proportionate among outstanding Awards, modify vesting dates, defer the delivery of stock certificates or make other equitable adjustments. Any such adjustments to outstanding Awards will be effected in a manner that precludes the enlargement of rights and benefits under such Awards. Adjustments, if any, and any determinations or interpretations, including any determination of whether a distribution is other than an ordinary cash dividend, made by the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of Shares of any class, or securities convertible into Shares of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of Common Stock subject to an Award.
6.2 . In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company or of a merger or corporate combination (a "Transaction") in which the successor corporation does not agree to assume the Award or substitute an equivalent Award, the Committee shall make a determination (subject to Section 7) as to the equitable treatment of outstanding Awards under the 2002 Stock Plan and shall notify Participants of such treatment no later than ten (10) days prior to such proposed Transaction. To the extent it has not been previously exercised, an Award that is not assumed will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed Transaction.

The Board may, at any time, amend or terminate the 2002 Stock Plan, provided that (i) no amendment or termination may, in the absence of written consent to the change by the affected Participant (or, if the Participant is not then living, the affected beneficiary), adversely affect the rights of any Participant or beneficiary under any Award granted under the 2002 Stock Plan prior to the date such amendment is adopted by the Board; provided that modifications or adjustments pursuant to Sections 6.1 or 6.2 or that may cause an Incentive Stock Option to become a Nonstatutory Stock Option shall in no event be deemed to have an adverse effect on any Award, and (ii) no such amendment shall be made without the approval of the Company's stockholders to the extent such approval is required by Applicable Laws, or if such amendment would lessen the stockholder approval requirements of Section 5.2(g) or this Section 7.

(Franklin) and its subsidiaries, which are not historical facts, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this press release, words or phrases generally written in the future tense and/or preceded by words such as will, may, could, expect, believe, anticipate, intend, plan, seek, estimate or other similar words are forward-looking statements.
 
Forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors, some of which are listed below, that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance.
 
These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, in Risk Factors and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Franklin's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended

Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. Franklin Resources, Inc. Preliminary Second Quarter Results  April 28, 2011 Exhibit 99.2
 
FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. 2 The financial results in this presentation are preliminary. Statements in this presentation regarding Franklin Resources, Inc. (Franklin) and its subsidiaries, which are not historical facts, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this presentation, words or phrases generally written in the future tense and/or preceded by words such as will, may, could, expect, believe, anticipate, intend, plan, seek, estimate or other similar words are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors, some of which are listed below, that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward- looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklins recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, in Risk Factors and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Franklins Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q: (1) volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets, and adverse changes in the global economy, may significantly affect our results of operations and may put pressure on our financial results; (2) the amount and mix of our assets under management are subject to significant fluctuations; (3) we are subject to extensive and complex, overlapping and frequently changing rules, regulations and legal interpretations; (4) regulatory and legislative actions and reforms have made the regulatory environment in which we operate more costly and future actions and reforms could adversely impact our assets under management, increase costs and negatively impact our profitability and future financial results; (5) changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity; (6) any significant limitation or failure of our software applications, technology or other systems that are critical to our operations could constrain our operations; (7) our investment management business operations are complex and a failure to properly perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of our products and services could have an adverse effect on our revenues and income; (8) we face risks, and corresponding potential costs and expenses, associated with conducting operations and growing our business in numerous countries; (9) we depend on key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services; (10) strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies with competing offerings and products could limit or reduce sales of our products, potentially resulting in a decline in our market share, revenues and net income; (11) changes in the third-party distribution and sales channels on which we depend could reduce our revenues and hinder our growth; (12) our increasing focus on international markets as a source of investments and sales of investment products subjects us to increased exchange rate and other risks in connection with earnings and income generated overseas; (13) poor investment performance of our products could affect our sales or reduce the level of assets under management, potentially negatively impacting our revenues and income; (14) we could suffer losses in earnings or revenue if our reputation is harmed; (15) our future results are dependent upon maintaining an appropriate level of expenses, which is subject to fluctuation; (16) our ability to successfully integrate widely varied business lines can be impeded by systems and other technological limitations; (17) our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, or legal liability; (18) certain of the portfolios we manage, including our emerging market portfolios, are vulnerable to significant market-specific political, economic, or other risks, any of which may negatively impact our revenues and income; (19) our revenues, earnings, and income could be adversely affected if the terms of our management agreements are significantly altered or these agreements are terminated by the funds and other sponsored investment products we advise; (20) regulatory and governmental examinations and/or investigations, litigation, and the legal risks associated with our business, could adversely impact our assets under management, increase costs and negatively impact our profitability and/or our future financial results; (21) our ability to meet cash needs depends upon certain factors, including the market value of our assets, operating cash flows and our perceived creditworthiness; (22) diverse and strong competition limits the interest rates that we can charge on consumer loans; (23) our business could be negatively affected if we or our banking subsidiaries fail to remain well capitalized, and liquidity needs could affect our banking business; and (24) we are dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this presentation speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law. The information in this presentation is provided solely in connection with this presentation, and is not directed toward existing or potential investment advisory clients or fund shareholders.

Notice of Stockholder Business and Nominations
(a)       Annual Meetings of Stockholders.
(1)       Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders only (i) pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto), (ii) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (iii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who was a stockholder of record of the Corporation at the time the notice provided for in this Section 2.3 is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.3.
(2)       For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of paragraph (a)(1) of this Section 2.3, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation and any such proposed business other than the nomination
of persons for election to the Board of Directors must constitute a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 120th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 150th day prior to the first anniversary of the date on which the Corporation first (i) mailed its notice of annual meeting, proxy statement and proxy or (ii) sent its notice of annual meeting and notice of internet availability of its proxy materials, whichever is earlier, for the immediately preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 30 days after (other than as a result of adjournment) the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 150th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 120th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth: (i) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director (A) all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and (B) such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected; (ii) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws of the Corporation, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (iii) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (A) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, (B) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, (C) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to the nomination or proposal between or among such stockholder and/or such beneficial owner, any of their respective affiliates or associates, and any others acting in concert with any of the foregoing, including, in the case of a nomination, the nominee, (D) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, warrants, convertible securities, stock appreciation or similar rights, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares) that has been entered into as of the date of the stockholder's notice by, or on behalf of, such stockholder and such beneficial owners, whether or not such instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in underlying shares of capital stock of the Corporation, the
 
effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, manage risk or benefit of share price changes for, or increase or decrease the voting power of, such stockholder or such beneficial owner, with respect to securities of the Corporation, (E) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, (F) a representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group which intends (I) to deliver a proxy statement and proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (II) otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such proposal or nomination, and (G) any other information relating to such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the proposal and/or for the election of directors in an election contest pursuant to and in accordance with Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The foregoing notice requirements of this paragraph (a) of this Section 2.3 shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder with respect to business other than a nomination if the stockholder has notified the Corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act and such stockholder's proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation.
(3)       Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 2.3 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors at an annual meeting is increased effective after the time period for which nominations would otherwise be due under paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 2.3 and there is no public announcement by the Corporation specifying the number of directors to be elected or naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least 120 days day prior to the first anniversary of the date on which the Corporation first (i) mailed its notice of annual meeting, proxy statement and proxy or (ii) or sent its notice of annual meeting and notice of internet availability of its proxy materials, whichever is earlier, for the immediately preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 2.3 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.
(b)       Special Meetings of Stockholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at
 
which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting (1) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (2) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this Section 2.3 is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and upon such election and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.3. In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 2.3 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 150th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 120th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made by the Corporation of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
(c)       General.
(1)       Except as otherwise expressly provided in any applicable rule or regulation promulgated under the Exchange Act, with respect to stockholder nominations and proposals, only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.3 shall be eligible to be elected at an annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.3. Except as otherwise provided by law, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (i) to determine whether a stockholder nomination or any business proposed by a stockholder to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.3 (including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of such stockholder's nominee or proposal in compliance with such stockholder's representation as required by clause (a)(2)(iii)(F) of this Section 2.3) and (ii) if any such proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this Section 2.3, to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3, unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present a nomination or proposed business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted,
 
notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 2.3, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders.
(2)       For purposes of this Section 2.3, "public announcement" shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
(3)       Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 2.3; provided however, that any references in these Bylaws to the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit any requirements applicable to nominations or proposals as to any other business to be considered pursuant to this Section 2.3 (including paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) and (b) hereof), and compliance with paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) and (b) of this Section 2.3 shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations or submit other business (other than, as provided in the penultimate sentence of (a)(2), business other than nominations brought properly under and in compliance with Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act, as may be amended from time to time). Nothing in this Section 2.3 shall be deemed to affect any rights (i) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals or nominations in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect directors pursuant to any applicable provisions of the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate").
Section 2.4     . Each annual or special meeting of stockholders shall be held at such location, if any, either within or without the State of Delaware as may be determined by the Board of Directors, or if no such determination is made, at such place as may be determined by the Chairman of the Board of Directors.

Section 2.5     . Notice of each annual or special meeting of stockholders shall contain such information, and shall be given to such persons at such time, and in such manner, including without limitation whether by electronic transmission or otherwise, as the Board of Directors shall determine, or if no such determination is made, as the Chairman of the Board shall determine, subject to the requirements of applicable law.

Section 2.6     . Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.

at
December 31, 2011
, up
$10.4 billion
or
2%
during the quarter. The increase was driven by
$27.2 billion
in market appreciation, partially offset by net new outflows of
$15.6 billion
. AUM remained essentially unchanged year over year, as net new flows of
$17.6 billion
and
$12.5 billion
from acquisitions were offset by market depreciation of
$27.4 billion
. Redemptions included $11.1 billion and $12.0 billion from an institutional advisory account during the quarters ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
Cash and cash equivalents and investments were

1
On December 8, 2011, the Company declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of
$0.27
per share and a special cash dividend of
$2.00
per share, both of which were paid on December 30, 2011. The quarterly dividend represents an
8%
increase over the dividend declared in the prior quarter and the same quarter a year ago. The quarterly and special dividends are consistent with the Company's long-term capital management strategy of continuing to invest in the business, maintaining financial strength and flexibility, and returning a substantial portion of the Company's earnings to stockholders through the payment of dividends and common stock repurchases.

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. 2 Statements in this presentation regarding Franklin Resources, Inc. (Franklin) and its subsidiaries, which are not historical facts, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this presentation, words or phrases generally written in the future tense and/or preceded by words such as will, may, could, expect, believe, anticipate, intend, plan, seek, estimate or other similar words are forward-looking statements. Forward- looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors, some of which are listed below, that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklins recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, in Risk Factors and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Franklins Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011: (1) volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets, and adverse changes in the global economy, may significantly affect our results of operations and may put pressure on our financial results; (2) the amount and mix of our assets under management (AUM) are subject to significant fluctuations; (3) we are subject to extensive and complex, overlapping and frequently changing rules, regulations and legal interpretations; (4) regulatory and legislative actions and reforms have made the regulatory environment in which we operate more costly and future actions and reforms could adversely impact our AUM, increase costs and negatively impact our profitability and future financial results; (5) changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity; (6) any significant limitation, failure or security breach of our software applications, technology or other systems that are critical to our operations could constrain our operations; (7) our investment management business operations are complex and a failure to properly perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of our products and services could have an adverse effect on our revenues and income; (8) we face risks, and corresponding potential costs and expenses, associated with conducting operations and growing our business in numerous countries; (9) we depend on key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services; (10) strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies with competing offerings and products could limit or reduce sales of our products, potentially resulting in a decline in our market share, revenues and income; (11) changes in the third-party distribution and sales channels on which we depend could reduce our income and hinder our growth; (12) our increasing focus on international markets as a source of investments and sales of investment products subjects us to increased exchange rate and other risks in connection with our revenues and income generated overseas; (13) poor investment performance of our products could affect our sales or reduce the level of AUM, potentially negatively impacting our revenues and income; (14) we could suffer losses in our revenues and income if our reputation is harmed; (15) our future results are dependent upon maintaining an appropriate level of expenses, which is subject to fluctuation; (16) our ability to successfully integrate widely varied business lines can be impeded by systems and other technological limitations; (17) our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, or legal liability; (18) certain of the portfolios we manage, including our emerging market portfolios, are vulnerable to significant market-specific political, economic or other risks, any of which may negatively impact our revenues and income; (19) our revenues and income could be adversely affected if the terms of our management agreements are significantly altered or these agreements are terminated by the funds and other sponsored investment products we advise; (20) regulatory and governmental examinations and/or investigations, litigation, and the legal risks associated with our business, could adversely impact our AUM, increase costs and negatively impact our profitability and/or our future financial results; (21) our ability to meet cash needs depends upon certain factors, including the market value of our assets, operating cash flows and our perceived creditworthiness; (22) diverse and strong competition limits the interest rates that we can charge on consumer loans; (23) our business could be negatively affected if we or our banking subsidiaries fail to remain well capitalized, and liquidity needs could affect our banking business; and (24) we are dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this presentation speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them.

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. 4 Highlights  Overall investment performance remains strong across equity, hybrid and fixed-income strategies  The global fixed-income funds that grabbed the most attention for their short-term underperformance during 2011 have rebounded significantly  Tax-free fixed-income funds attracted net inflows, core hybrid flows also turned positive, and equity outflows slowed, however, a decline in global fixed-income sales resulted in net outflows  The Companys Board of Directors increased the regular cash dividend for the 31st consecutive year, and declared a special cash dividend of $2.00 per share, while we continued to reduce shares outstanding via repurchases

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.1, a person shall not be entitled, as a matter of right, to indemnification pursuant to this Section 4.1 against costs or expenses incurred in connection with any action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such person against any person who is or was a director, officer, fiduciary or employee of the Corporation or a Subsidiary Officer of any Affiliated Entity, but such indemnification may be provided by the Corporation in a specific case as permitted by Section 4.6 of this Article.
Section 4.2    . The Corporation, to the full extent permitted, and in the manner required, by the laws of the State of Delaware as in effect at the time of the adoption of this Article or as such laws may be amended from time to time, shall indemnify any person who was or is made a party to or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit (including any appeal thereof) brought in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of, or to represent the interests of, the Corporation as a Subsidiary Officer of an Affiliated Entity against expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements) and costs actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless, and except to the extent that, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such judgment was rendered shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses and costs as the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.2, a person shall not be entitled, as a matter of right, to indemnification pursuant to this Section 4.2 against costs and expenses incurred in connection with any action or suit in the right of the Corporation (or part thereof)
Indemnification Respecting Derivative Claims
 
commenced by such person, but such indemnification may be provided by the Corporation in any specific case as permitted by Section 4.6 of this Article.
Section 4.3    . Any indemnification under Section 4.1 or 4.2 of this Article (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director, officer or employee is proper under the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in, Section 4.1 or 4.2 of this Article. Such determination shall be made with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination (i) by a majority vote of the Board of Directors who were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum or (ii) by a committee of such directors (each of whom is not a party to such action, suit or proceeding) designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors or if the disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iv) by the stockholders. In the event a request for indemnification is made by any person referred to in Section 4.1 or Section 4.2 of this Article, the Corporation shall cause such determination to be made not later than 60 days after such request is made.

(b)        To the extent any person who is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation has served or prepared to serve as a witness in any action, suit or proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative in nature) or in any investigation by the Corporation or the Board of Directors thereof or committee thereof or by any securities exchange on which securities of the Corporation are or were listed by reason of his services as a director, officer or employee of the Corporation or as a Subsidiary Officer of any Affiliated Entity (other than in a suit commenced by such person), the Corporation shall indemnify such person against expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements) and costs actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith (following the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding) within 30 days after receipt by the Corporation from such person of a statement requesting such indemnification, averring such service and reasonably evidencing such expenses and costs.

Such expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by other former directors and officers or employees of the Corporation may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Corporation deems appropriate.
Section 4.6    . The provision of indemnification to, or the advancement of expenses and costs to, any person under this Article, or the entitlement of any person to indemnification or advancement of expenses and costs under this Article, shall not limit or restrict in any way the power of the Corporation to indemnify or advance expenses and costs to such person in any other way permitted by law or be deemed exclusive of, or invalidate, any right to which any person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses and costs may be entitled under any Bylaw, law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person's capacity as an officer, director or employee of the Corporation and as to action to any other capacity while holding any such position.
Indemnification Not Exclusive
Section 4.7    . The indemnification provided or permitted under this Article shall apply in respect of any expense, cost, judgment, fine, penalty or amount paid in settlement, whether or not the claim or cause of action in respect thereof accrued or arose before or after the effective date of this Article. The right of any person who is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation to indemnification under this Article shall continue after he shall have ceased to be a director, officer or employee and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, distributees, executors, administrators and other legal representatives of such person.

(Franklin) and its subsidiaries, which are not historical facts, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this presentation, words or phrases generally written in the future tense and/or preceded by words such as will, may, could, expect, believe, anticipate, intend, plan, seek, estimate or other similar words are forward-looking statements. Forward- looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors, some of which are listed below, that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklins recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, in Risk Factors and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Franklins Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 and Franklins subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q: (1) volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets, and adverse changes in the global economy, may significantly affect our results of operations and may put pressure on our financial results; (2) the amount and mix of our assets under management (AUM) are subject to significant fluctuations; (3) we are subject to extensive and complex, overlapping and frequently changing rules, regulations and legal interpretations; (4) regulatory and legislative actions and reforms have made the regulatory environment in which we operate more costly and future actions and reforms could adversely impact our AUM, increase costs and negatively impact our profitability and future financial results; (5) changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity; (6) any significant limitation, failure or security breach of our software applications, technology or other systems that are critical to our operations could constrain our operations; (7) our investment management business operations are complex and a failure to properly perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of our products and services could have an adverse effect on our revenues and income; (8) we face risks, and corresponding potential costs and expenses, associated with conducting operations and growing our business in numerous countries; (9) we depend on key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services; (10) strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies with competing offerings and products could limit or reduce sales of our products, potentially resulting in a decline in our market share, revenues and income; (11) changes in the third-party distribution and sales channels on which we depend could reduce our income and hinder our growth; (12) our increasing focus on international markets as a source of investments and sales of investment products subjects us to increased exchange rate and other risks in connection with our revenues and income generated overseas; (13) poor investment performance of our products could affect our sales or reduce the level of AUM, potentially negatively impacting our revenues and income; (14) we could suffer losses in our revenues and income if our reputation is harmed; (15) our future results are dependent upon maintaining an appropriate level of expenses, which is subject to fluctuation; (16) our ability to successfully integrate widely varied business lines can be impeded by systems and other technological limitations; (17) our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, or legal liability; (18) certain of the portfolios we manage, including our emerging market portfolios, are vulnerable to significant market-specific political, economic or other risks, any of which may negatively impact our revenues and income; (19) our revenues and income could be adversely affected if the terms of our management agreements are significantly altered or these agreements are terminated by the funds and other sponsored investment products we advise; (20) regulatory and governmental examinations and/or investigations, litigation, and the legal risks associated with our business, could adversely impact our AUM, increase costs and negatively impact our profitability and/or our future financial results; (21) our ability to meet cash needs depends upon certain factors, including the market value of our assets, operating cash flows and our perceived creditworthiness; (22) our business could be negatively affected if we or our banking subsidiaries fail to remain well capitalized, and liquidity needs could affect our banking business; and (23) we are dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this presentation speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.

On September 19, 2012, Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") entered into: (i) an underwriting agreement (the "2017 Underwriting Agreement") with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as representatives (the "Representatives") of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to the Underwriters $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 1.375% Notes due 2017 (the "2017 Notes") and (ii) an underwriting agreement (the "2022 Underwriting Agreement", and together with the 2017 Underwriting Agreement, the "Underwriting Agreements") with the Representatives, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to the Underwriters $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.800% Notes due 2022 (the "2022 Notes", and together with the 2017 Notes, the "Notes"), for sale by the Underwriters (collectively, the "Offering") pursuant to the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-183969) (the "Registration Statement"). On September 19, 2012, the Company priced the Offering and on September 24, 2012, the Offering closed. The Company realized approximately $593.9 million in proceeds from the Offering, net of underwriting discounts and commissions. The Company intends to use approximately $305 million of the net proceeds of the Offering to redeem all of its outstanding 2.000% notes due May 20, 2013, approximately $183 million to finance its acquisition of a majority stake in K2 Advisors Holdings LLC and the remainder for general corporate purposes. The foregoing does not constitute a notice of redemption for or an obligation to issue a notice of redemption for the Company's outstanding notes.
The Underwriters have performed investment banking and advisory services for the Company and for certain of the Company's funds from time to time in the ordinary course, for which certain of the Underwriters may have received customary fees and expenses. These services have included acting as underwriters and distributors and providing financing. The Underwriters may, from time to time, engage in other transactions with and perform services for the Company and its funds in the ordinary course of their business.
The Notes were issued by the Company under an Indenture, dated as of May 19, 1994 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor to Chemical Bank, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), as amended and supplemented by a first supplemental indenture, dated as of October 9, 1996 (the "First Supplemental Indenture") and a third supplemental indenture, dated as of September 24, 2012 (inclusive of the form of Global Note for each series of the Notes, the "Third Supplemental Indenture"). The Base Indenture as amended and supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture and the Third Supplemental Indenture is referred to as the "Indenture."
Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2013. The 2017 Notes will mature on September 15, 2017 and the 2022 Notes will mature on September 15, 2022. The Notes will be unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company and will rank equal in right of payment with respect to each other and with all of the Company's existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future debt of the Company's subsidiaries.
The Company may redeem the Notes prior to maturity in whole or in part at any time, at its option, at certain "make-whole" redemption prices. In the case of any such redemption, the Company will also pay accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.
The Indenture contains, subject to exceptions, limitations on the Company's ability and the ability of certain of its subsidiaries to pledge voting stock or profit participating equity interests in the subsidiaries to secure other debt without also similarly securing the Notes equally and ratably. The Indenture also includes requirements that must be met if the Company consolidates or merges with, or sells all or substantially all of its assets to, another entity.
The Notes contain customary events of default, including:

This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
Indemnification and Contribution
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, (ii) under the heading "Underwriting", (A) the first paragraph, (B) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (C) the fourth
 
paragraph related to concessions and reallowances, (D) the sixth and seventh paragraphs related to stabilization and syndicate covering transactions and (E) the third sentence of the eleventh paragraph related to allocation of the Securities in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party.

provided
however
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably
 
incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
provided
however
9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the
Default by an Underwriter
provided
however
 
aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
10. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such delivery and payment (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal, New York State or California authorities, (iii) a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
Termination
11. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.

(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably
 
incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).

4. Other than as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus Supplement, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect and, to my knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened by governmental authorities or by others.

The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act.
5. The execution, delivery and performance of the Notes by the Company have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. The Notes have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, when paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreements (assuming the due authentication and delivery thereof by the Trustee), will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity, including principles of

Based solely on a telephone confirmation by the Staff of the Commission, we are not aware of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any notice objecting to its use. To our knowledge, no proceedings therefor have been instituted or overtly threatened by the Commission.
7. The execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreements by the Company have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. The Underwriting Agreements have been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company.
8. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Underwriting Agreements and the Indenture and the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder, including the issuance and sale of the Notes, will not conflict with, constitute a default under or violate (i) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, or the Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Company, (ii) New York, Delaware corporate or federal law or regulation (other than federal and state securities or blue sky laws, as to which we express no opinion in this paragraph) or (iii) any judgment, writ, injunction, decree, order or ruling of any court or governmental authority binding on the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries of which we are aware.
9. No consent, approval, waiver, license or authorization or other action by or filing with any New York, Delaware corporate or federal governmental authority is required in connection with the execution and delivery by the Company of the Underwriting Agreements, the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby or the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder, except for filings and other actions required pursuant to federal and state securities or blue sky laws, as to which we express no opinion in this paragraph.
10.

11. The statements made in the Disclosure Package and Prospectus under the caption "Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders," insofar as they constitute statements of United States federal income tax law or legal conclusions with respect thereto, and subject to the limitations set forth therein, fairly summarize the matters referred to therein in all material respects.
12. The statements in the Disclosure Package and Prospectus under the caption "Certain ERISA Considerations," insofar as such statements purport to describe provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or Section 4975 of U.S. federal tax law

Forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors, some of which are listed below, that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklins recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, in Risk Factors and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Franklins Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 and Franklins subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q: (1) volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets, and adverse changes in the global economy, may significantly affect our results of operations and may put pressure on our financial results; (2) the amount and mix of our assets under management (AUM) are subject to significant fluctuations; (3) we are subject to extensive and complex, overlapping and frequently changing rules, regulations and legal interpretations; (4) regulatory and legislative actions and reforms have made the regulatory environment in which we operate more costly and future actions and reforms could adversely impact our AUM, increase costs and negatively impact our profitability and future financial results; (5) failure to comply with the laws, rules or regulations in any of the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate could result in substantial harm to our reputation and results of operations; (6) changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity; (7) any significant limitation, failure or security breach of our software applications, technology or other systems that are critical to our operations could constrain our operations; (8) our business operations are complex and a failure to properly perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of our products and services could have an adverse effect on our revenues and income; (9) we face risks, and corresponding potential costs and expenses, associated with conducting operations and growing our business in numerous countries; (10) we depend on key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services; (11) strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies with competing offerings and products could limit or reduce sales of our products, potentially resulting in a decline in our market share, revenues and income; (12) changes in the third-party distribution and sales channels on which we depend could reduce our income and hinder our growth; (13) our increasing focus on international markets as a source of investments and sales of investment products subjects us to increased exchange rate and other risks in connection with our revenues and income generated overseas; (14) poor investment performance of our products could affect our sales or reduce the level of AUM, potentially negatively impacting our revenues and income; (15) we could suffer losses in our revenues and income if our reputation is harmed; (16) our future results are dependent upon maintaining an appropriate level of expenses, which is subject to fluctuation; (17) our ability to successfully integrate widely varied business lines can be impeded by systems and other technological limitations; (18) our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, or legal liability; (19) certain of the portfolios we manage, including our emerging market portfolios, are vulnerable to significant market-specific political, economic or other risks, any of which may negatively impact our revenues and income; (20) regulatory and governmental examinations and/or investigations, litigation and the legal risks associated with our business, could adversely impact our AUM, increase costs and negatively impact our profitability and/or our future financial results; (21) our ability to meet cash needs depends upon certain factors, including the market value of our assets, operating cash flows and our perceived creditworthiness; (22) our business could be negatively affected if we or our banking subsidiaries fail to remain well capitalized, and liquidity needs could affect our banking services; and (23) we are dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this presentation speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them.

On June 13, 2013, Charles B. Johnson announced his retirement as a director and Chairman of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company"). The remaining directors appointed Gregory E. Johnson as Chairman of the Board. Mr. G.

Gregory E. Johnson and Charles E. Johnson are brothers and sons of Charles B. Johnson, brothers of Jennifer M. Johnson, the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, and nephews of Rupert H. Johnson, Jr., Vice Chairman and a director of the Company.
Charles E.

In November, 2012, Tano and the Company entered into an amendment extending the lease for a fixed five-year term. The lease amendment reduces the office space leased by Tano on the San Mateo campus to 4,125 square feet. The aggregate payments due under the lease extension are $148,500 per annum.
On July 6, 2011, Franklin Templeton Capital Holdings Private Limited ("FTCH"), a subsidiary of the Company, entered into an agreement to make a $25 million investment commitment to Tano India Private Equity Fund II ("Tano India Fund").
